Abstract = {When developing behavior change interventions in a systematic way, it is
   important to select determinants relevant to the target behavior. Data
   is needed to gain insight into the determinant structures (the relative
   strengths of associations between determinants and behavior) and their
   univariate distributions. This insight is crucial to select the most
   relevant determinants, but at the same time institutions tasked with
   behavior change (e.g. prevention organizations, municipal health
   services) often operate under prohibitive resource constraints, which
   also extend to how easily they can collect data from a sample. This
   paper introduces CIBERlite - an approach that furnishes the intervention
   developer with an idea of the relevance of a limited number of
   determinants using short measurements informed by theory. The first
   study (N = 401) in a series of three explores the convergent validity of
   short and full measurements of determinants derived from the Reasoned
   Action Approach. The short measurements are used in the main study (N =
   415) that serves as a proof-of-concept for the CIBERlite plot, an
   efficient visualization combining data of determinant structures and
   their univariate distributions for eight behaviors. The unexpected
   patterns detected in the main study led to an expert estimation study (N
   = 45), which shows that individual experts have difficulty in predicting
   how people score on determinants. This stresses the importance of
   conducting determinant studies and CIBERlite is a valuable alternative
   to do so if resources are limited.},

Title = {A mixed-methods evaluation of the acceptability and fidelity of the
   James' Place model for men experiencing suicidal crisis},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Background Research supports development of informal, community-based
   suicide prevention interventions that can be tailored to suit men's
   unmet needs. The James' Place model (JPM) is a community-based, clinical
   suicide prevention intervention for men experiencing suicidal crisis.
   Evidence supports the efficacy of the JPM and there are plans to expand
   to additional sites across the UK. This study evaluates therapists
   perceived acceptability of the JPM, and if fidelity to the planned
   delivery of the model is maintained within therapeutic practice.Method A
   mixed-methods design was used. Descriptive analyses of 30 completed
   intervention cases were examined to review fidelity of the model against
   the intervention delivery plan. Eight therapists took part in
   semi-structured interviews between November 2021 and March 2022
   exploring the perceived acceptability, and barriers and facilitators to
   delivering the JPM.Results Descriptive analyses of James' Place audit
   notes revealed high levels of adherence to the JPM amongst therapists,
   but highlighted components of the model needed to be tailored according
   to individual men's needs. Thematic analysis led to the development of
   five themes. The first theme, therapeutic environment highlighted
   importance of the therapy setting. The second theme identified was
   specialised suicide prevention training in the JPM that facilitated
   therapists understanding and expertise. The third theme identified was
   therapy engagement which discusses men's engagement in therapy. The
   fourth theme, person-centred care related to adaptation of delivery of
   JPM components. The final theme, adapting the JPM to individual needs
   describes tailoring of the JPM by therapists to be responsive to
   individual men's needs.Conclusion The findings evidence therapist's
   acceptability and their moderate adherence to the JPM. Flexibility in
   delivery of the JPM enables adaptation of the model and co-production of
   therapy to meet men's needs. Implications for clinical practice are
   discussed.},

Title = {Development, feasibility, and acceptability of SPoRT: a dating violence
   and sexual risk prevention intervention for college student-athletes},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {BackgroundStudent-athletes are one subgroup of college students in the
   USA at risk for dating violence and sexual risk behaviors. Despite this,
   research on student-athletes' dating behaviors is limited; existing
   research pertains primarily to the National Collegiate Athletic
   Association (NCAA) Division I athletes and focuses on male
   student-athletes as perpetrators of dating and sexual violence. While
   some existing programs aim to reduce dating violence and promote healthy
   relationships, these programs are education based, and not tailored to
   the specific strengths and challenges of student-athletes. We therefore
   designed Supporting Prevention in Relationships for Teams (SPoRT), a
   novel, four-session prevention intervention for Division III
   student-athletes of all genders to reduce dating violence and sexual
   risk behavior by targeting knowledge and skills identified in pilot
   research, incorporating psychoeducation with techniques from
   cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, bystander intervention, and
   normative feedback.MethodsThis study represents stage 1 of the National
   Institutes of Health (NIH) Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention
   Development, evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of SPoRT. We
   describe the development, content, and proposed delivery methods for
   SPoRT and evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of the program
   using a mixed-methods approach. Thirty college student-athletes (12 men,
   18 women) completed questionnaires and participated in focus groups to
   provide feedback on the program's length, timing, group size and
   dynamics, content, and suggestions for making the SPoRT prevention
   intervention more feasible and acceptable.ResultsOur recruitment
   procedures were successful, and participants rated the program as
   feasible in terms of delivery methods and logistics. Participants liked
   that SPoRT was developed based on pilot data collected from
   student-athletes, brief, and skills based and tailored to athletic team
   needs. SPoRT was perceived as appropriate and relevant to
   student-athlete needs in terms of dating violence and sexual risk
   prevention knowledge and skills. Most participants (63\%) rated the
   program as ``excellent{''} and said they would recommend it to
   others.ConclusionsWe found SPoRT to be both feasible and acceptable in
   terms of content and delivery. Suggested modifications will be
   incorporated into the SPoRT healthy relationships prevention
   intervention to be tested in an NIH Stage 1 efficacy trial.},

Abstract = {BackgroundNon-memory-led dementias such as posterior cortical atrophy
   (PCA), primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and behavioural variant
   frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are low prevalent and often affect
   individuals under the age of 65. Tailored educational and support
   resources for caregivers of people living with these dementia phenotypes
   are scarce and unevenly distributed geographically. Web-based
   educational programmes are emerging as promising alternatives to improve
   caregiver self-efficacy and well-being. Here, we present the protocol of
   a study aiming to assess the feasibility of a co-produced online
   educational programme for caregivers of people living PCA, PPA and
   bvFTD: the Better Living with Non-memory-led Dementia programme.MethodsA
   randomised controlled feasibility trial will be conducted on a sample of
   30 caregivers of people living with PCA, PPA and bvFTD. Participants
   will be recruited among members of the support organisation Rare
   Dementia Support (based at UCL in the UK). The intervention group will
   be given access to an 8-week co-produced web-based educational programme
   consisting of 6 modules addressing education about PCA, PPA and bvFTD
   and support strategies for the person with dementia and for the
   caregiver. The control group will receive treatment as usual (TAU).
   Feasibility will be measured through feasibility of recruitment,
   clinical measurement tools and acceptability. Clinical measures will be
   used to assess preliminary efficacy and data on completion rates,
   missing data and variability used to decide on measures to be included
   in a full-scale trial.Allocation ratio will be 2:1
   (intervention:control) stratified by diagnosis. Feasibility of
   recruitment and acceptability will be assessed. Clinical measures will
   be administered at baseline and 8-week and 3-month post-randomisation.
   The control group will be offered access to the intervention at the
   completion of data collection. Participants will be unblinded, and all
   measures will be self-reported online.MethodsA randomised controlled

   for improving care competency of caregivers and may contribute to
   overcoming geographical inequalities in local provision of support
   services.
   This pilot study will inform a fully powered international trial to
   determine the effectiveness of Better Living with Non-memory-led
   Dementia.Trial registrationThis trial has been registered prospectively
   on the Clinical Trials Registry on 1st September 2022, registration

Abstract = {Objective Systematically review randomized controlled trials on the
   efficacy of cognitive training on executive functions in healthy older
   people.Measures The outcome measures were related to inhibitory control,
   working memory, and cognitive flexibility.Results Thirty-one trials were
   included in the systematic review and thirteen trials in the
   meta-analysis. In the overall analysis, the cognitive training enhanced
   inhibitory control when measured by the Stroop task (p < .001, d = 1.64)
   and working memory when measured by the Corsi Block task (p = .002, d =
   .16). A marginal significance was found for working memory in the Digit
   Span task - Forward (p = .06, d = .92). However, cognitive training did
   not enhance inhibitory control when measured by the Go/No-Go task (p =
   .76, d = .59), working memory when measured by the Digit Span - Backward
   (p = .72, d = .95) and N-Back (p = .10, d = .26) tasks, and cognitive
   flexibility when measured by Trail Making - Part B (p = .08, d = .27)
   and Semantic Fluency (p = .49, d = .06) tasks.Conclusion Mixed evidence
   was found for inhibitory control and working memory; cognitive
   flexibility showed no evidence of improvement.},

Title = {Acceptance and commitment therapy processes and their association with
   distress in cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 27},
Abstract = {Around 42\% of individuals with cancer experience distress. Acceptance
   and commitment therapy (ACT) can reduce distress, but effects are small,
   and mechanisms unclear. This review aimed to identify associations
   between ACT processes and distress in cancer. Search terms included
   cancer, ACT processes, self-compassion, and distress. Six online
   databases and grey literature were searched until March 2022. Of 6555
   papers screened, 108 studies were included with 17,195 participants.
   Five meta-analyses of 77 studies were conducted. Random effects
   meta-analyses of correlations revealed higher scores on flexible
   processes (acceptance, present moment awareness, self-compassion) were
   associated with lower distress (rpooled = -0.24, -0.39, -0.48,
   respectively); whilst higher scores on inflexible processes
   (experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion) were associated with higher
   distress (rpooled = 0.58, 0.57, respectively). Meta-analyses displayed
   moderate-to-high heterogeneity with most studies assessed as low risk of
   bias. Meta-regressions revealed no significant moderators (stage, time
   since diagnosis, gender and age). This review provides a theoretically
   aligned evidence base for associations between ACT processes and
   distress in cancer, supporting elements of ACT theory and providing
   targeted directions for intervention development. Due to limited
   evidence, future research should focus on self-as-context, values and
   committed action and conduct mediation analysis in controlled trials of
   ACT processes on distress in cancer.},

Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 9},
Abstract = {Informal caregivers play an increasingly important role in the provision
   of care services, especially for the ageing population. At present, the
   evidence on the resilience of the Internet to family caregivers is still
   limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors related
   to the resilience of the Internet to family caregivers. We searched
   retrieved randomized controlled trials (rct) of the effects of Internet
   interventions on resilience in informal caregivers from the beginning of
   the database to 1 November 2022. A preliminary search identified 3348
   studies, 5 of which met the inclusion criteria. The studies involved 482
   participants from four countries. Our results show that compared to the
   control group, internet intervention can effectively improve the
   resilience level of caregivers {[}SMD = 0.65, 95\%CI(0.04?1.26), P \&
   LE; 0.05]. In our study, Web-based interventions can significantly
   improve the adaptability of informal caregivers. In addition, our
   research also pointed out many resources that can be used, such as
   online learning, online answers and online psychological counseling
   provided for caregivers through the Internet, which can effectively
   reduce their burden of care and thus improve their resilience. In the
   future, these findings can be used to develop projects to improve the
   resilience of caregivers through personalized Internet intervention, so
   as to meet the care needs of patients.},

Abstract = {BackgroundObesity is a chronic disease and is an established risk factor
   for other chronic diseases and mortality. Young adulthood is a period
   when people may be highly amenable to healthy behavior change, develop
   lifelong healthy behaviors, and when primary prevention of obesity may
   be feasible. Interventions in early adulthood have the potential for
   primary or primordial prevention (i.e., preventing risk factors before
   disease onset). The primary objective of this study is to determine the
   feasibility of a 6-month behavioral and educational intervention to
   promote healthy behaviors for obesity prevention among young
   adults.MethodsThis is the study protocol for a pilot randomized
   controlled trial. Young adults (age 18-29) attending McMaster
   University, Hamilton, Canada, will be recruited and randomized to either
   the intervention or control. The intervention will include individual
   motivational interviewing sessions (online or in-person) with a trained
   interviewer plus educational materials (based on Canada's food guide and
   physical activity recommendations). The control group will receive
   educational materials only. The primary feasibility outcomes that will
   be evaluated as part of this pilot study include enrollment, retention
   (\& GE; 80\%), data completion (\& GE; 80\% of weights measured, and
   surveys completed), and participant satisfaction. Secondary clinical
   outcomes will include body mass index (BMI) change from baseline to 6
   months, physical activity, nutrition risk, health-related quality of
   life mental health, and economic outcomes. Outcomes will be measured
   remotely using activity trackers, and online questionnaires at baseline
   and every 2 months. Risk stratification will be applied at baseline to
   identify participants at high risk of obesity (e.g., due to family or
   personal history). Exit questionnaires will collect data on how
   participants felt about the study and cost analysis will be
   conducted.DiscussionOur pilot randomized controlled trial will evaluate
   the feasibility of an obesity prevention intervention in early adulthood
   and will inform future larger studies for obesity prevention. The
   results of this study have the potential to directly contribute to the
   primary prevention of several types of cancer by testing an intervention
   that could be scalable to public health, post-secondary education, or
   primary care settings.Trial

Abstract = {BackgroundStress levels and thus the risk of developing related physical
   and mental health conditions are rising worldwide. Dysfunctional beliefs
   contribute to the development of stress. Potentially, such beliefs can
   be modified with approach-avoidance modification trainings (AAMT). As
   previous research indicates that effects of AAMTs are small, there is a
   need for innovative ways of increasing the efficacy of these
   interventions. For this purpose, we aim to evaluate the feasibility of
   the intervention and study design and explore the efficacy of an
   innovative emotion-based AAMT version (eAAMT) that uses the display of
   emotions to move stress-inducing beliefs away from and draw
   stress-reducing beliefs towards oneself.MethodsWe will conduct a
   parallel randomized controlled pilot study at the
   Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany. Individuals
   with elevated stress levels will be randomized to one of eight study
   conditions (n = 10 per condition) - one of six variants of the eAAMT, an
   active control intervention (swipe-based AAMT), or an inactive control
   condition. Participants in the intervention groups will engage in four
   sessions of 20-30 min (e)AAMT training on consecutive days. Participants
   in the inactive control condition will complete the assessments via an
   online tool. Non-blinded assessments will be taken directly before and
   after the training and 1 week after training completion. The primary
   outcome will be perceived stress. Secondary outcomes will be
   dysfunctional beliefs, symptoms of depression, emotion regulation
   skills, and physiological stress measures. We will compute effect sizes
   and conduct mixed ANOVAs to explore differences in change in outcomes
   between the eAAMT and control conditions.DiscussionThe study will
   provide valuable information to improve the intervention and study
   design. Moreover, if shown to be effective, the approach can be used as
   an automated smartphone-based intervention. Future research needs to
   identify target groups benefitting from this intervention utilized
   either as stand-alone treatment or an add-on intervention that is
   combined with other evidence-based treatments.Trial registrationThe

Abstract = {Background Food gardening may positively influence cardiovascular
   disease (CVD) risk-related behaviors. However, the vast majority of
   existing gardening interventions have used an in-person delivery model
   which has limitations for scalability. It is not known whether a
   digitally delivered gardening intervention would be feasible or
   acceptable to participants. The purpose of this pilot study was to
   assess the feasibility of a digitally delivered gardening intervention
   in three domains: participant acceptability, demand, and practicality.
   Methods A single-arm, pre-post-study design was used. Participants (n =
   30) were aged 20 + with no plans to garden in the coming season and had
   at least 1 CVD risk factor. The intervention included ten 1-h
   video-conferencing sessions, written materials, and access to a study
   website. Content focused on gardening skills, cooking skills, and the
   Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Feasibility
   outcomes included acceptability (postprogram ratings), demand (session
   attendance rate), and practicality (ability to start a garden and grow
   F\&V). The study was considered feasible if the following criteria were
   met: = 70\% rated the intervention as good or excellent, overall session
   attendance rate was = 70\%, and > 70\% were able to start a garden and
   grow F\&V. We also assessed prepost-program changes in behavioral
   mediators (gardening confidence, gardening enjoyment, cooking
   confidence, and nutrition knowledge). Descriptive statistics were
   calculated. Pre-post differences were evaluated with means and 95\%
   confidence intervals (95\% CI). Effect sizes were calculated (Cohen's
   d).
   Results All feasibility criteria were met. A total of 93.3\% of
   participants rated the intervention as good or excellent, 96\% started a
   garden and grew F\&V, and the overall session attendance rate was 81\%.
   The largest mean pre-post changes were in gardening confidence (pre 7.1
   {[}95\% CI: 6.4, 7.9], post 9.0 {[}95\% CI: 8.6, 9.5], Cohen's d =
   1.15), gardening enjoyment (pre: 6.3 {[}95\% CI: 5.9, 6.7], post: 7.5
   {[}95\% CI: 7.1, 7.9], Cohen's d = 1.69), and cooking self-efficacy
   (pre: 4.7 {[}95\% CI: 4.3, 5.1], post: 7.7 {[}95\% CI: 7.3, 8.0],
   Cohen's d = 3.0).
   Conclusion A digitally delivered gardening intervention was feasible,
   acceptable to participants, and they had meaningful changes in
   behavioral mediators. The next step is to evaluate the impact of the
   intervention in a future randomized controlled trial.},

Abstract = {Background Teacher-delivered behavioral classroom management
   interventions are effective for students with or at-risk for
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other disruptive
   behavior challenges, but they can be difficult for teachers to use in
   the classroom. In this study, we will pilot test a package of
   implementation strategies to support teachers in using behavioral
   classroom interventions for students with ADHD symptoms.
   Methods We will use a 2-group, randomized controlled trial to compare
   outcomes for teachers who receive Positive Behavior Management
   Implementation Resources (PBMIR), a theory and data-driven
   implementation resource package designed to increase teacher
   implementation of behavioral classroom management interventions, with
   those who do not receive this additional implementation support. We will
   measure teacher implementation outcomes (e.g., observed fidelity to
   behavioral classroom interventions) and student clinical outcomes (e.g.,
   ADHD-related impairment, ADHD symptoms, student-teacher relationship,
   academic performance) before and after an 8-week intervention period for
   both groups; we will also measure teacher-reported acceptability,
   appropriateness, and feasibility for the PBMIR group following the
   intervention period.
   Discussion If there is preliminary evidence of feasibility and
   effectiveness, this pilot study will provide the foundation for
   evaluation the PBMIR at a larger scale and the potential to improve
   outcomes for students with or at risk for ADHD.},

Title = {Development and testing the feasibility of a sports-based mental health
   promotion intervention in Nepal: a protocol for a pilot

Abstract = {BackgroundMental wellbeing encompasses life satisfaction, social
   connectedness, agency and resilience. In adolescence, mental wellbeing
   reduces sexual health risk behaviours, substance use and violence;
   improves educational outcomes; and protects mental health in adulthood.
   Mental health promotion seeks to improve mental wellbeing and can
   include activities to engage participants in sport. However, few
   high-quality trials of mental health promotion interventions have been
   conducted with adolescents, especially in low- and middle-income
   countries. We sought to address this gap by testing SMART (Sports-based
   Mental heAlth pRomotion for adolescenTs) in a pilot cluster-randomised
   controlled trial (cRCT) in Bardiya, Nepal.MethodsThe objectives of the
   trial are to assess the acceptability and feasibility of SMART, test
   trial procedures, explore outcome distributions in intervention and
   control clusters and calculate the total annual cost of the intervention
   and unit cost per adolescent. The trial design is a parallel-group,
   two-arm superiority pilot cRCT with a 1:1 allocation ratio and two
   cross-sectional census surveys with adolescents aged 12-19, one
   pre-intervention (baseline) and one post-intervention (endline). The
   study area is four communities of approximately 1000 population (166
   adolescents per community). Each community represents one cluster. SMART
   comprises twice weekly football, martial arts and dance coaching, open
   to all adolescents in the community, led by local sports coaches who
   have received psychosocial training. Sports melas (festivals) and
   theatre performances will raise community awareness about SMART, mental
   health and the benefits of sport. Adolescents in control clusters will
   participate in sport as usual. In baseline and endline surveys, we will
   measure mental wellbeing, self-esteem, self-efficacy, emotion
   regulation, social support, depression, anxiety and functional
   impairment. Using observation checklists, unstructured observation and
   attendance registers from coaching sessions, and minutes of meetings
   between coaches and supervisors, we will assess intervention fidelity,
   exposure and reach. In focus group discussions and interviews with
   coaches, teachers, caregivers and adolescents, we will explore
   intervention acceptability and mechanisms of change. Intervention costs
   will be captured from monthly project accounts, timesheets and
   discussions with staff members.DiscussionFindings will identify elements
   of the intervention and trial procedures requiring revision prior to a
   full cRCT to evaluate the effectiveness of SMART.},

Title = {Mindfulness enhances cognitive functioning: a meta-analysis of 111
   randomized controlled trials},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 24},
Abstract = {BackgroundCurrently no comprehensive meta-analysis of MBI efficacy on
   global and unique cognitive subdomains exist.MethodExamined the effects
   of MBIs on global cognition and 15 cognitive subdomains. Inclusion
   criteria: meditation naive participants; randomized controlled trial;
   outcome included one objective or subjective cognitive functioning
   measure; primary focus was teaching mindfulness skills. Exclusion
   criteria: inadequate data; one-session ; control condition contained any
   MBI component. Robust variance estimation and moderator analyses
   controlling for presence of treatment fidelity were
   conducted.ResultsOne-hundred-and-eleven RCTs (n = 9,538) met eligibility
   criteria. MBIs had small-to-moderate significant effects on global
   cognition, executive attention, working memory accuracy, inhibition
   accuracy, shifting accuracy, sustained attention, and subjective
   cognitive functioning (vs. waitlist/no-treatment, g = 0.257-0.643; vs.
   active controls, g = 0.192-0.394). MBIs did not impact executive
   functioning (EF) latency indices, verbal fluency, processing speed,
   episodic memory, and cognitive error. Treatment effects were stronger
   for those with elevated psychiatric symptoms vs. healthy controls, and
   medical samples, studies with complete-case (vs. intention-to-treat)
   analysis, face-to-face (vs. self-guided) delivery, and non-standard (vs.
   standard MBI).ConclusionMBIs consistently yielded small-to-moderate yet
   practically meaningful effect sizes on global cognition and six
   cognitive subdomains that captured accuracy vs. latency-based indices of
   EF and sustained accuracy.},

Abstract = {Background Social-emotional capacities contribute to children's mental
   health by helping them navigate their own and others' emotional states
   and forge healthy relationships. Caregivers and educators are critical
   socialization agents in early and middle childhood, but gaps remain in
   the systematic integration of social-emotional research into caregiver
   and educator trainings. The aim of this pilot study was to test the
   feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a social-emotional training
   designed to promote caregivers' and educators' capacities to support
   social-emotional development in children ages 3-8 years.Methods Fifty
   adults (n = 24 caregivers of children ages 3-8 years, n = 26 educators
   working with children ages 3-8 years) participated in a virtual training
   over 3 weeks. Participants completed pre-training, post-training, and
   2-month follow-up questionnaires evaluating their knowledge of
   social-emotional concepts, use of training strategies, mental health,
   and satisfaction with the training. Caregivers also reported children's
   social-emotional capacities and mental health.Results On average,
   caregivers and educators completed 83\% of the virtual training sessions
   and reported high satisfaction with the training. Further, preliminary
   evidence indicated that caregivers' and educators' knowledge of
   social-emotional concepts increased pre- to post-training and was
   maintained at the 2-month follow-up. Increases in caregivers' and
   educators' knowledge and greater use of training strategies were
   associated with improvements in children's social-emotional capacities
   and caregivers' and educators' own mental health.Conclusions These pilot
   results support the feasibility of infusing evidence-based
   social-emotional content into caregiver and educator training
   initiatives aimed at nurturing child social-emotional development and
   mental health. The results inform future evaluation of the short- and
   long-term benefits of this training with a full-scale randomized
   controlled trial design.},

Title = {Using Decision Analysis for Intervention Value Efficiency to Select
   Optimized Interventions in the Multiphase Optimization Strategy},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 3},
Abstract = {Objective: Optimizing multicomponent behavioral and biobehavioral
   interventions presents a complex decision problem. To arrive at an
   intervention that is both effective and readily implementable, it may be
   necessary to weigh effectiveness against implementability when deciding
   which components to select for inclusion. Different components may have
   differential effectiveness on an array of outcome variables. Moreover,
   different decision-makers will approach this problem with different
   objectives and preferences. Recent advances in decision-making
   methodology in the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) have opened
   new possibilities for intervention scientists to optimize interventions
   based on a wide variety of decision-maker preferences, including those
   that involve multiple outcome variables. In this study, we introduce
   decision analysis for intervention value efficiency (DAIVE), a
   decision-making framework for use in MOST that incorporates these new
   decision-making methods. We apply DAIVE to select optimized
   interventions based on empirical data from a factorial optimization
   trial. Method: We define various sets of hypothetical decision-maker
   preferences, and we apply DAIVE to identify optimized interventions
   appropriate to each case. Results: We demonstrate how DAIVE can be used
   to make decisions about the composition of optimized interventions and
   how the choice of optimized intervention can differ according to
   decision-maker preferences and objectives. Conclusions: We offer
   recommendations for intervention scientists who want to apply DAIVE to
   select optimized interventions based on data from their own factorial
   optimization trials.},

Title = {My Baby, My Move plus : feasibility of a community prenatal wellbeing
   intervention},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {BackgroundExcessive gestational weight gain (EGWG), insufficient
   prenatal physical activity and sleep, and poor psychological wellbeing
   independently increase risks for adverse maternal and infant outcomes. A
   novel approach to mitigate these risks is utilizing peer support in a
   community-based prenatal intervention. This study assessed the
   feasibility (acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality) of
   a remotely delivered prenatal physical activity intervention called My
   Baby, My Move + (MBMM +) that aims to increase prenatal physical
   activity, enhance mood and sleep hygiene, and reduce
   EGWG.MethodsParticipants were recruited through community organizations,
   local clinics, and social media platforms in the Fall of 2020 and Spring
   of 2021. Eligible pregnant women were randomized to either the MBMM +
   intervention or the control group. Each group met over Zoom for 16
   sessions (twice weekly for 60 min over 8 weeks) to learn either
   behavioral change and wellbeing knowledge and skills (MBMM +) or
   knowledge and skills related to parenting (control group). Multiple
   methods of evaluation to better understand the feasibility of the
   intervention were conducted.ResultsA total of 49 women (25 MBMM +
   intervention, 24 control) completed both pre- and post-survey
   assessments and were included in the analyses. A subsample of 19 (39\%)
   intervention participants completed a combination of semi-structured
   interviews/surveys to assess acceptability, demand, implementation, and
   practicality. Participants expressed positive feedback regarding
   acceptability (satisfaction and intent to continue use) and were
   extremely likely or likely to recommend the program to a friend
   (demand). Implementation metrics were assessed by observation and
   feedback forms completed by peer leaders and demonstrated high-quality
   control. Findings suggest that the intervention was practical due to
   remote sessions and cost-effectiveness.ConclusionThe MBMM + intervention
   was deemed to be a feasible intervention with high acceptability,
   demand, implementation, and practicality. These findings can be used to
   inform the scalability of the intervention and implementation of a
   larger efficacy trial.},

Title = {Improving reflective evaluations of sport through repeated experiences

   Youth Sport Program},

Abstract = {IntroductionAdolescents who drop out of sport often report that it had
   become less `fun' and `enjoyable' over time. Although preadolescent
   sport typically emphasizes experiences of fun, emphases on competition
   and elite performance often dominate during adolescence. We theorized
   that adherence to adolescent sport might be improved if the overarching
   goal were to maximize repeated experiences of fun during sport and,
   subsequently, increase reflective evaluations of sport enjoyment. To
   that end, this manuscript reports on the rationale and design of the
   PlayFit Youth Sport Program (PYSP), as well as its preliminary
   feasibility and acceptability. The main objectives were to evaluate the
   feasibility of recruitment strategies and data collection procedures and
   the acceptability of the intervention.SettingAn outdoor, multipurpose
   grass field at a south-central Pennsylvania middle school.MethodsA
   mixed-methods, single-arm feasibility trial lasting for 8 weeks
   (August-October 2021) offered 3-times per week for 1-h per session. The
   equipment, ruleset, and psychosocial environment of the PYSP sport games
   were modified to reduce several of the constraints theorized to impair
   experiences of fun during sport and hamper reflective evaluations of
   enjoyment afterward. ResultsEleven healthy, but sedentary adolescents in
   grades 5-7 completed the program. The median number of sessions attended
   (of 16 possible) was 12 (range = 6-13). Post-intervention, 9/10
   respondents indicated that they `looked forward' to the PYSP, 8/10 would
   recommend it to a friend, and 8/10 were interested in continuing the
   program. Ten of 11 participant guardians expressed interest in
   reenrolling their children if the PYSP were offered again. Some changes
   recommended were to improve recruitment via advertising the positive
   aspects of the program and ``word of mouth{''} techniques, offering the
   program immediately following the school day, having contingencies for
   inclement weather, and minor changes to the sport equipment to improve
   the experience among the population the PYSP intends to
   attract.ConclusionsThe adjustments recommended in this preliminary work
   could be used to further refine the PYSP. A future efficacy trial could
   explore whether the PYSP may reduce attrition for adolescents who
   experience existing sport programs negatively by offering an alternative
   that better matches their unique needs and preferences.},

Title = {Accelerating the development of a psychological intervention to restore

Abstract = {Background A high proportion of patients diagnosed with
   schizophrenia-spectrum disorders will at some point in their lives be
   assessed as not having the capacity to make their own decisions about
   pharmacological treatment or inpatient care ('capacity'). Few will be
   helped to regain it before these interventions proceed. This is partly
   because effective and safe methods to do so are lacking. Our aim is to
   accelerate their development by testing, for the first time in mental
   healthcare, the feasibility, acceptability and safety of running an
   `Umbrella' trial. This involves running, concurrently and under one
   multi-site infrastructure, multiple assessor-blind randomised controlled
   trials, each of which is designed to examine the effect on capacity of
   improving a single psychological mechanism ('mechanism'). Our primary
   objectives are to demonstrate feasibility of (i) recruitment and (ii)
   data retention on the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Treatment
   (MacCAT-T; planned primary outcome for a future trial) at
   end-of-treatment. We selected three mechanisms to test: `self-stigma',
   low self-esteem and the `jumping to conclusions' bias. Each is highly
   prevalent in psychosis, responsive to psychological intervention, and
   hypothesised to contribute to impaired capacity.
   Methods Sixty participants with schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses,
   impaired capacity and one or more mechanism(s) will be recruited from
   outpatient and inpatient mental health services in three UK sites
   (Lothian, Scotland; Lancashire and Pennine; North West England). Those
   lacking capacity to consent to research could take part if the key
   criteria were met, including either proxy consent (Scotland) or
   favourable Consultee advice (England). They will be allocated to one of
   three randomised controlled trials, depending on which mechanism(s) they
   have. They will then be randomised to receive, over an 8-week period and
   in addition to treatment as usual (TAU), 6 sessions of either a
   psychological intervention which targets the mechanism, or 6 sessions of
   assessment of the causes of their incapacity (control condition).
   Participants are assessed at 0 (baseline), 8 (end-of-treatment) and 24
   (follow-up) weeks post-randomisation using measures of capacity
   (MacCAT-T), mechanism, adverse events, psychotic symptoms, subjective
   recovery, quality of life, service use, anxiety, core schemata and
   depression. Two nested qualitative studies will be conducted; one to
   understand participant and clinician experiences and one to investigate
   the validity of MacCAT-T appreciation ratings.
   Discussion This will be the first Umbrella trial in mental healthcare.
   It will produce the first 3 single-blind randomised controlled trials of
   psychological interventions to support treatment decision-making in
   schizophrenia-spectrum disorder. Demonstrating feasibility will have
   significant implications not only for those seeking to support capacity
   in psychosis, but also for those who wish to accelerate the development
   of psychological interventions for other conditions.},

Abstract = {BackgroundIn Ireland, the agriculture sector reports the highest number
   of fatalities even though farmers constitute only 6\% of the working
   population. Tractor-related behaviours are implicated in 55\% of all
   vehicle work-related fatalities and 25\% of reported injuries, and many
   of these occur in farmyards. There is limited research on the
   feasibility and acceptability of behaviour change interventions to
   improve tractor safety. Target behaviours that promote safe operation in
   farmyards, determining and addressing blind spots of tractors, were
   identified, and an intervention was developed following the Behaviour
   Change Wheel Approach. The objective of the study is to examine the
   feasibility, fidelity and acceptability of a behaviour change
   intervention to enhance the safe operation of tractors in farmyards with
   a particular focus on tractor blind spots.MethodA single group
   feasibility study will be undertaken. Approximately 16 farmers from four
   major farm types will be recruited for the study between August and
   September 2022. The intervention involves an in-person demo session,
   facilitated discussion and personalised safety training procedure with
   safety goals. The study will collect data from participants at three
   time points: baseline (3-10 days prior to the intervention), during the
   intervention and at the follow-up session (7-30 days post-intervention).
   Quantitative data will be collected through a pre-intervention interview
   and feedback surveys. A pre- and post-intervention qualitative interview
   will also be conducted with the participants and will be supplemented
   with qualitative data from recruitment logs, observational memos and
   logs and feedback from recruiters. Evaluation of the feasibility,
   acceptability and fidelity of the intervention will be guided by a
   pre-determined feasibility checklist, fidelity framework and theoretical
   framework of acceptability, respectively. Interviews will be analysed
   using the content analysis.DiscussionThe current study can determine the
   feasibility and fidelity of delivering a systematic, theoretically
   driven, tailored behaviour change intervention. It will also assess
   whether the intervention, its ingredients and delivery are acceptable to
   the farming population. This study will also inform the development of a
   future larger trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention.},

Abstract = {BackgroundEarly language difficulties are associated with poor school
   readiness and can impact lifelong attainment. The quality of the early
   home language environment is linked to language outcomes. However, few
   home-based language interventions have sufficient evidence of
   effectiveness in improving preschool children's language abilities. This
   study reports the first stage in the evaluation of a theory-based
   programme, Talking Together (developed and delivered by BHT Early
   Education and Training) given over 6 weeks to families in the home
   setting. We aimed to test the feasibility and acceptability of
   delivering Talking Together in the Better Start Bradford community prior
   to a definitive trial, using a two-armed randomised controlled
   feasibility study.MethodsFamilies from a single site within the Better
   Start Bradford reach area were randomly allocated (1:1) to the Talking
   Together intervention or a wait list control group. Child language and
   parent-level outcome measures were administered before randomisation
   (baseline), pre-intervention (pre-test), 2 months post-intervention
   start (post-test), and 6 months post-intervention start (follow-up).
   Routine monitoring data from families and practitioners were also
   collected for eligibility, consent, protocol adherence, and attrition
   rates. Descriptive statistics on the feasibility and reliability of
   potential outcome measures were analysed alongside qualitative feedback
   on trial design acceptability. Pre-defined progression-to-trial criteria
   using a traffic light system were assessed using routine monitoring
   data.ResultsTwo-hundred and twenty-two families were assessed for
   eligibility; of these, 164 were eligible. A total of 102 families
   consented and were randomised (intervention: 52, waitlist control: 50);
   68\% of families completed outcome measures at 6-month follow-up.
   Recruitment (eligibility and consent) reached `green' progression
   criteria; however, adherence reached `amber' and attrition reached `red'
   criteria. Child- and parent-level data were successfully measured, and
   the Oxford-CDI was identified as a suitable primary outcome measure for
   a definitive trial. Qualitative data not only indicated that the
   procedures were largely acceptable to practitioners and families but
   also identified areas for improvement in adherence and attrition
   rates.ConclusionsReferral rates indicate that Talking Together is a
   much-needed service and was positively received by the community. A full
   trial is feasible with adaptations to improve adherence and reduce
   attrition.},

Title = {Keeping Active with Texting after Stroke (KATS): development of a text
   message intervention to promote physical activity and exercise after
   stroke},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {BackgroundPost-stroke physical activity reduces disability and risk of
   further stroke. When stroke rehabilitation ends, some people feel
   abandoned by services and struggle to undertake physical activities that
   support recovery and health. The aim of this study was to codesign a
   novel text message intervention to promote physical activity among
   people with stroke and provide support when formal rehabilitation ends.
   This manuscript describes the intervention development processes that
   will inform future pilot and feasibility studies.MethodsThe planned
   intervention was a series of text messages to be sent in a predetermined
   sequence to people with stroke at the end of rehabilitation. The
   intervention, underpinned by behaviour change theory and using salient
   behaviour change techniques, would provide daily messages offering
   encouragement and support for the uptake and maintenance of physical
   activity following stroke. The intervention was codesigned by a
   Collaborative Working Group, comprised of people with stroke,
   rehabilitation therapists, representatives from stroke charities and
   academics. A four-step framework was used to design the intervention:
   formative research on physical activity post-stroke, creation of the
   behaviour change text message intervention, pre-testing and refinement.
   Formative research included a review of the scientific evidence and
   interviews with community-dwelling people with stroke. Data generated
   were used by the Collaborative Working Group to identify topics to be
   addressed in the intervention. These were mapped to constructs of the
   Health Action Process Approach, and salient behaviour change techniques
   to deliver the intervention were identified. The intervention was
   rendered into a series of text messages to be delivered over 12 weeks.
   The draft intervention was revised and refined through an iterative
   process including review by people with stroke, their spouses,
   rehabilitation therapists and experts in the field of stroke.The
   messages encourage regular physical activity but do not prescribe
   exercise or provide reminders to exercise at specific times. They use
   conversational language to encourage engagement, and some are
   personalised for participants. Quotes from people with stroke provide
   encouragement and support and model key behaviour change techniques such
   as goal setting and coping planning.DiscussionCo-design processes were
   critical in systematically developing this theory and evidence-based
   intervention. People with stroke and rehabilitation therapists provided
   insights into perceived barriers post-rehabilitation and identified
   strategies to overcome them. The structured multistep approach
   highlighted areas for improvement through successive rounds of review.
   The intervention will be tested for acceptability, feasibility and
   effectiveness in future studies. This co-design approach could be used
   for interventions for other heath behaviours and with different
   populations.},

Abstract = {BackgroundEvasive personality disorder (AvPD) and social phobia (SP)
   have substantial costs for patients and their families and great
   economic costs to the society. While psychotherapy can be an efficacious
   treatment, many patients drop out during treatment. Increased knowledge
   on how to decrease dropout from psychotherapy is warranted, including
   how to increase a patient's readiness for psychotherapy.MethodsWe
   describe a randomized controlled feasibility and superiority trial of 42
   individuals with a clinical diagnosis of either SP or AvPD, who are to
   initiate psychotherapeutic treatment in Danish outpatient mental health
   services. They will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either
   assessment-as-usual and receive no further assessment or to a Modified
   Collaborative Assessment (MCA) provided as a pre-treatment intervention
   before psychotherapy initiation. MCA will include a battery of
   psychological tests designed to thoroughly assess the patients'
   psychopathology. The tests are administered in collaboration with the
   patient, including detailed oral and written feedback. We hypothesize
   that the intervention is feasible regarding patient's acceptance and
   adherence. We further hypothesize that patients randomized to MCA will
   reach higher levels of readiness for psychotherapy as assessed with the
   University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale
   (URICA).DiscussionThis protocol assesses the feasibility, efficacy,
   acceptability, and safety of an intervention aimed at changing the
   readiness for participation in psychotherapy of patients with SP and
   AvPD. Results from this feasibility study could guide the development of
   future large-scale trials of MCA and procedures for MCA treatment
   fidelity assessment.},

Abstract = {Background Exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) and child
   maltreatment are preventable threats to child health. Few evidence-based
   interventions target both SHS and child maltreatment risk. The purpose
   of this paper is to describe the systematic braiding process of two
   evidence-based programs to address child SHS in the home and
   maltreatment perpetration risk, and present results from the formative
   work and pilot study.
   Methods The first 4 steps of the systematic braiding process were
   completed, including the following: (1) the identification of core
   elements of both programs, (2) the development of an initial draft of
   the braided curriculum (Smoke-Free Home SafeCare - SFH-SC), (3) an
   acceptability and feasibility pilot of SFH-SC with caregivers of young
   children who reported a smoker living in the home (N = 8), and (4)
   feedback collection on the braided curriculum from SafeCare Providers (N
   = 9).
   Results Experts identified common pedagogical and theoretical
   underpinnings for the two programs and braided Smoke-Free Homes: Some
   Things Are Better Outside into two SafeCare modules. Caregiver feedback
   from the pilot demonstrated that participants were engaged with SFH-SC
   and felt supported and comfortable discussing SHS intervention content
   with the SFH-SC Provider. Caregiver self-reports indicated a slight
   increase in smoke-free home rules from baseline to follow-up and a
   notable reduction in parent stress on the Parent Stress Index of 5.9
   points (SD = 10.2). SafeCare Provider feedback following intensive
   review of the curriculum indicated high feasibility for SFH-SC delivery.
   Conclusions Parent and Provider findings suggest SFH-SC is a viable
   intervention that has potential to reduce the public health impact of
   SHS and child maltreatment for at-risk families.},

Abstract = {BackgroundDespite effective treatments, one fifth of patients develop
   chronic depression. Music therapy may offer a different approach. This
   study aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability of a music therapy
   intervention and trial methodology.MethodsA parallel two-arm randomised
   controlled trial with wait-list control, mixed feasibility/acceptability
   measures and nested process evaluation. Adults with long-term depression
   (symptom duration > 1 year) were recruited from community mental health
   services and computer randomised to 42 sessions of group music therapy
   with songwriting three times per week or wait-list control. Depression,
   social functioning, distress, quality of life, satisfaction and service
   use were assessed by blinded researchers at enrolment, 1 week and 3 and
   6 months post-therapy. Outcomes were analysed descriptively, controlling
   for baseline covariates. Recruitment (number eligible, participation and
   retention rates) and intervention (fidelity, adherence) feasibility were
   assessed using pre-defined stop-go criteria. Attendance, adverse events,
   mood, relationship satisfaction and semi-structured interviews were
   analysed in a nested process evaluation.ResultsRecruitment processes
   were feasible with 421 eligible, 12.7\% participation and 60\% (18/30)
   retention. Thirty participants were randomised to intervention (N = 20)
   and control (N = 10). Session attendance was low (mean 10.5) with four
   withdrawals. Music therapist adherence was good but changes to session
   frequency were suggested. Outcomes were available for 10/20 treatment
   and 9/10 wait-list participants. Depression increased in both arms
   post-therapy. Treatment depression scores fell below baseline 3 and 6
   months post-therapy indicating improvement. Wait-list depression scores
   increased from baseline 3 and 6 months post-therapy. At 3 months, the
   treatment arm improved from baseline on all measures except satisfaction
   and functioning. At 6 months, quality of life, distress and functioning
   improved with reduction in health service contacts. High-attending
   participants improved more than low-attending. Seven adverse events (one
   serious) were reported.LimitationsAs this was a feasibility study,
   clinical outcomes should be interpreted cautiously.ConclusionA
   randomised controlled trial of group music therapy using songwriting is
   feasible with inclusion criteria and session frequency modifications,
   but further intervention development is required.},

Abstract = {BackgroundEarly adolescence is a time of increased vulnerability for the
   development of common mental health conditions such as anxiety and
   depression (internalising outcomes). Current treatments such as
   cognitive-behavioural therapy and antidepressant medication are focused
   on the individual and have small effect sizes, particularly in
   real-world clinical settings such as the public Child Adolescent Mental
   Health Services (CAMHS). Parents are an important and under-utilised
   resource in treating these conditions in young adolescents. Teaching
   parents how to respond to their young person's emotions can improve
   emotion regulation and reduce internalising outcomes. One
   emotion-focused programme for parents of this age group is Tuning in to
   Teens (TINT). This is a structured, manualised skills group for parents
   only focused on teaching skills to coach young people through their
   emotional experiences. This study aims to investigate the impact of TINT
   in the clinical setting of publicly funded CAMHS in New
   Zealand.MethodsThe trial will evaluate the feasibility of a two-arm
   multi-site randomised control trial (RCT). Participants will be
   10-14-year-olds referred to CAMHS in Wellington, New Zealand, with
   anxiety or depression, and their parents or guardians. Arm 1 will be
   parents attending and implementing TINT (in addition to the usual care
   received at CAMHS). Arm 2 will be usual care only. TINT groups will be
   facilitated by CAMHS clinicians who have been trained in the programme
   and will be delivered over 8 weekly sessions. Prior to the RCT, a
   co-design methodology will be used with service users to inform outcome
   measures used in the trial. A group of service users meeting the RCT
   criteria will be recruited to take part in workshops to help determine
   their priority outcomes. Measures based on the results of workshops will
   be included in the outcome measures. The primary feasibility outcomes
   will be the recruitment and retention of participants, acceptability of
   the intervention for service users and clinicians and acceptability of
   outcome measures.DiscussionThere is a need to improve outcomes for the
   treatment of adolescent anxiety and depression. TINT is a programme with
   the potential to enhance outcomes for those accessing mental health
   services by providing targeted support to parents of adolescents. This
   trial will inform whether a full RCT is feasible to evaluate TINT.
   Including service users in the design will increase its relevance of an
   evaluation in this setting.},

Abstract = {Background The use of psychoactive substances significantly impacts the
   health, social and economic aspects of families, communities and
   nations. There is a need to develop and test psychological interventions
   aimed for individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) in lower- and
   middle-income countries (LMICs), such as in Pakistan. The aim of this
   exploratory trial is to test the feasibility and acceptability of two
   culturally adapted psychological interventions in a factorial randomised
   controlled trial (RCT).Methods The proposed project will be conducted in
   three phases. The first phase of the study will focus on cultural
   adaptation of the interventions through qualitative interviews with key
   stakeholders. The second phase will be to refine and produce manually
   assisted interventions. Third and last stage would be to assess the
   feasibility of the culturally adapted interventions through a factorial
   RCT. The study will be carried out in Karachi, Hyderabad, Peshawar,
   Lahore and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Recruitment of participants will take
   place from primary care and volunteer organisations/drug rehabilitation
   centres. A total of 260 individuals diagnosed with SUD (n = 65) in each
   of the four arms will be recruited. The intervention will be delivered
   weekly over a period of 12 weeks in both individual and group settings.
   Assessments will be carried out at baseline, at 12th week (after
   completion of intervention) and 24th week post-randomisation. The
   analysis will determine the feasibility of recruitment, randomisation,
   retention and intervention delivery. Acceptability of intervention will
   be determined in terms of adherence to intervention, i.e. the mean
   number of sessions attended, number of home assignments completed,
   attrition rates, as well as through process evaluation to understand the
   implementation process, context, participants' satisfaction, and impact
   of the study intervention. The health resource use and impact on the
   quality of life will be established through health economic
   data.Discussion This study will provide evidence for feasibility and
   acceptability of culturally adapted manually assisted psychological
   interventions for individuals with SUD in the context of Pakistan. The
   study will have clinical implications if intervention is proven feasible
   and acceptable.},

Abstract = {BackgroundMental illnesses comprise the single largest source of
   health-related economic burden globally, and low- and middle-income
   countries are disproportionately affected. The majority of people with
   schizophrenia who need treatment do not receive it and are often wholly
   reliant on family caregivers for daily care and support. Family
   interventions have an exceptionally robust evidence base for their
   efficacy in high-resource settings, but it is unknown whether they can
   produce equivalent effects in some low-resource settings where cultural
   beliefs, explanatory models of illness and contextual socio-economic
   issues differ.MethodsThis protocol describes the methods for a
   randomised controlled trial to determine the feasibility of testing
   culturally adapt and refine an evidence-based, family intervention for
   relatives and caregivers of people with schizophrenia in Indonesia. The
   feasibility and acceptability of implementing our adapted, co-produced
   intervention via task shifting in primary care settings will be
   evaluated using the Medical Research Council framework for complex
   interventions. We will recruit 60 carer-service-user dyads and randomise
   them in a 1:1 ratio either to receive our manualised intervention or
   continue to receive treatment as usual. Healthcare workers in primary
   care settings will be trained to deliver family interventions using our
   manualised intervention by a family intervention specialist.
   Participants will complete the ECI, IEQ, KAST and GHQ. Service-user
   symptom level and relapse status will be measured using the PANSS at
   baseline, post-intervention and 3 months later by trained researchers.
   Fidelity to the intervention model will be measured using the FIPAS.
   Qualitative evaluation will further assist with refining the
   intervention, evaluating trial processes and evaluating
   acceptability.DiscussionNational healthcare policy in Indonesia supports
   the delivery of mental health services in a complex network of primary
   care centres. This study will provide important information on the
   feasibility of delivering family interventions for people with
   schizophrenia via task shifting in primary care settings in Indonesia
   and allow further refinement of the intervention and trial processes.},

Abstract = {Background People with intellectual disabilities (ID) experience high
   rates of lifestyle related morbidities, in part due to lack of access to
   tailored health promotion programmes. This study aimed to assess the
   feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a tailored healthy lifestyle
   intervention, Get Healthy! Methods Get Healthy! is a 12-week physical
   activity and healthy eating programme designed to address
   lifestyle-related risks for adults with mild-moderate ID. The
   feasibility pilot was designed to assess subjective participant
   experience and programme feasibility across: recruitment and screening,
   retention, session attendance and engagement, adverse events, and
   practicality and reliability of outcome procedures. Exploratory
   programme efficacy was assessed across the following measures:
   anthropometry (body mass index, weight, waist circumference),
   cardiovascular fitness, physical strength, dietary intake, healthy
   literacy, and quality of life.
   Results Six participants with moderate ID and two carer participants
   completed the feasibility trial, representing a 100\% retention rate.
   Qualitative data indicated the programme was well received. Participants
   with ID attended 75\% of sessions offered and displayed a high level of
   engagement in sessions attended (91\% mean engagement score). While most
   data collection procedures were feasible to implement, several measures
   were either not feasible for our participants, or required a higher
   level of support to implement than was provided in the existing trial
   protocol. Participants with ID displayed decreases in mean waist
   circumference between baseline and endpoint (95\% CI: - 3.20, - 0.17 cm)
   and some improvements in measures of cardiovascular fitness and physical
   strength. No changes in weight, body mass index, or objectively measured
   knowledge of nutrition and exercise or quality of life were detected
   from baseline to programme endpoint. Dietary intake results were mixed.
   Discussion The Get Healthy! programme was feasible to implement and well
   received by participants with moderate ID and their carers. Exploratory
   efficacy data indicates the programme has potential to positively impact
   important cardiometabolic risk factors such as waist circumference,
   cardiovascular fitness, and physical strength. Several of the proposed
   data collection instruments will require modification or replacement
   prior to use in a sufficiently powered efficacy trial.},

Title = {Snacktivity™ to promote physical activity and reduce future risk of

Abstract = {Background Many people do not regularly participate in physical
   activity, which may negatively impact their health. Current physical
   activity guidelines are focused on promoting weekly accumulation of at
   least 150 min of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity
   (MVPA). Whilst revised guidance now recognises the importance of making
   small changes to physical activity behaviour, guidance still focuses on
   adults needing to achieve at least 150 min of MVPA per week. An
   alternative `whole day' approach that could motivate the public to be
   more physically active, is a concept called Snacktivity (TM). Instead of
   focusing on achieving 150 min per week of physical activity, for example
   30 min of MVPA over 5 days, Snacktivity (TM) encourages the public to
   achieve this through small, but frequent, 2-5 min `snacks' of MVPA
   throughout the whole day.
   Methods The primary aim is to undertake a feasibility trial with nested
   qualitative interviews to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
   the Snacktivity (TM) intervention to inform the design of a subsequent
   phase III randomised trial. A two-arm randomised controlled feasibility
   trial aiming to recruit 80 inactive adults will be conducted.
   Recruitment will be from health and community settings and social media.
   Participants will be individually randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive
   either the Snacktivity (TM) intervention or usual care. The intervention
   will last 12 weeks with assessment of outcomes completed before and
   after the intervention in all participants. We are interested in whether
   the Snacktivity (TM) trial is appealing to participants (assessed by the
   recruitment rate) and if the Snacktivity (TM) intervention and trial
   methods are acceptable to participants (assessed by Snacktivity
   (TM)/physical activity adherence and retention rates). The intervention
   will be delivered by health care providers within health care
   consultations or by researchers. Participants' experiences of the trial
   and intervention, and health care providers' views of delivering the
   intervention within health consultations will be explored.
   Discussion The development of physical activity interventions that can
   be delivered at scale are needed. The findings from this study will
   inform the viability and design of a phase III trial to assess the
   effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Snacktivity (TM) to increase
   physical activity.},

Abstract = {Background Drastic increases in the rates of maternal depression and
   anxiety have been reported since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Most
   programs aim to improve maternal mental health or parenting skills
   separately, despite it being more effective to target both concurrently.
   The Building Emotional Awareness and Mental health (BEAM) program was
   developed to address this gap. BEAM is a mobile health program aiming to
   mitigate the impacts of pandemic stress on family well-being. Since many
   family agencies lack infrastructure and personnel to adequately treat
   maternal mental health concerns, a partnership will occur with Family
   Dynamics (a local family agency) to address this unmet need. The study's
   objective is to examine the feasibility of the BEAM program when
   delivered with a community partner to inform a larger randomized
   controlled trial (RCT). Methods A pilot RCT will be conducted with
   mothers who have depression and/or anxiety with a child 6-18 months old
   living in Manitoba, Canada. Mothers will be randomized to the 10 weeks
   of the BEAM program or a standard of care (i.e., MoodMission). Back-end
   App data (collected via Google Analytics and Firebase) will be used to
   examine feasibility, engagement, and accessibility of the BEAM program;
   cost-effectiveness will also be examined. Implementation elements (e.g.,
   maternal depression {[}Patient Health Questionnaire-9] and anxiety
   {[}Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7]) will be piloted to estimate the
   effect size and variance for future sample size calculations. Discussion
   In partnership with a local family agency, BEAM holds the potential to
   promote maternal-child health via a cost-effective and an easily
   accessible program designed to scale. Results will provide insight into
   the feasibility of the BEAM program and will inform future RCTs.},

Abstract = {BackgroundImpairment of arm movement occurs in up to 85\% of people
   post-stroke, affecting daily living activities, and quality of life.
   Mental imagery effectively enhances hand and daily function in people
   with stroke. Imagery can be performed when people imagine themselves
   completing the movement or imagine another person doing it. However,
   there is no report on the specific use of first-person and third-person
   imagery in stroke rehabilitation.AimsTo develop and assess the
   feasibility of the First-Person Mental Imagery (FPMI) and the
   Third-Person Mental Imagery (TPMI) programs to address the hand function
   of people with stroke living in the community.MethodsThis study
   comprises phase 1-development of the FPMI and TPMI programs, and phase
   2-pilot-testing of the intervention programs. The two programs were
   developed from existing literature and reviewed by an expert panel. Six
   participants with stroke, living in the community, participated in the
   pilot-testing of the FPMI and TPMI programs for 2 weeks. Feedback
   collected included the suitability of the eligibility criteria,
   therapist's and participant's adherence to intervention and
   instructions, appropriateness of the outcome measures, and completion of
   the intervention sessions within the specified time.ResultsThe FPMI and
   TPMI programs were developed based on previously established programs
   and included 12 hand tasks. The participants completed four 45-min
   sessions in 2 weeks. The treating therapist adhered to the program
   protocol and completed all the steps within the specified time frame.
   All hand tasks were suitable for adults with stroke. Participants
   followed the instructions given and engaged in imagery. The outcome
   measures selected were appropriate for the participants. Both programs
   showed a positive trend towards improvement in participants' upper
   extremity and hand function and self-perceived performance in activities
   of daily living.ConclusionsThe study provides preliminary evidence that
   these programs and outcome measures are feasible for implementation with
   adults with stroke living in the community. This study outlines a
   realistic plan for future trials in relation to participant recruitment,
   training of therapists on the intervention delivery, and the use of
   outcome measures.},

Title = {A personhood and citizenship training workshop for care home staff to
   potentially increase wellbeing of residents with dementia: intervention
   development and feasibility testing of a cluster randomised controlled
   trial},

Abstract = {Background In the UK, one third of people with dementia live in
   residential care homes, a sector where high staff turnover negatively
   affects continuity of care. To examine the effect of including
   personhood and citizenship principles in training, interventions need to
   be robustly tested, with outcomes relevant to residents with dementia.
   Methods Phase one intervention development: The training intervention
   (PERSONABLE) comprised five reflective exercises facilitated by a mental
   health nurse/researcher. PERSONABLE was informed by four focus groups,
   and one field exercise, consisting of care home staff and family
   members. Phase two feasibility testing: Participants were (i) care home
   residents with dementia and (ii) care home staff working in any role.
   After baseline measurements, care homes were randomly allocated to (i)
   staff receiving PERSONABLE training or (ii) training as usual.
   Feasibility outcomes were the recruitment and attrition of care homes,
   residents and staff members (measured ten weeks between randomisation
   and follow-up), the acceptability of the training intervention
   PERSONABLE, and acceptability of outcome measures. The care home
   environment was evaluated, at baseline, using the Therapeutic
   Environment Screening Survey for Residential Care Homes. Measurements
   conducted at baseline and follow-up were resident wellbeing (Dementia
   Care Mapping (TM)), staff knowledge of and confidence with personhood
   and citizenship (Personhood in Dementia Questionnaire and a perceived
   ability to care visual analogue scale). Inter-rater agreement for
   Dementia Care Mapping (TM) was undertaken at follow-up in one
   intervention and one training as a usual care home. Results Phase one:
   The developed reflective approach to the PERSONABLE exercises appeared
   to give staff a holistic understanding of residents living with
   dementia, seeing them as autonomous people rather than reductively as
   persons with a condition. Phase two: Six care homes, 40 residents and
   118 staff were recruited. Four residents were lost to follow-up.
   Twenty-nine staff in the PERSONABLE arm of the study received the
   training intervention. In the PERSONABLE arm, 26 staff completed both
   baseline and follow-up measurements compared to 21 in the training as
   the usual arm. The most common reason for the loss to follow-up of staff
   was leaving employment. For the outcome measure Dementia Care Mapping
   (TM), the proportion of overall agreement between the two observers was
   18.6\%. High attrition of staff occurred in those homes undergoing
   leadership changes. Conclusion With the right approach, it is possible
   to achieve good engagement during trial recruitment and intervention
   delivery of care home managers, staff and residents. Organisational
   changes are a less controllable aspect of trials but having a visible
   researcher presence during data collection helps to capitalise the
   engagement of those staff remaining in employment. Tailored, brief and
   flexible training interventions encourage staff participation.
   Simplification of study methods helps promote and retain sufficient
   staff in a definitive randomised controlled trial. This study found that
   some components of Dementia Care Mapping (TM) work effectively as an
   outcome measure. However, inter-rater reliability was poor, and the
   practical implementation of the measurement would need a great deal of
   further refinement to accurately capture the effect of a training
   intervention if delivered across a large number of clusters.
   The Dementia Care Mapping (TM) measurement fidelity issue would be
   further complicated if using multiple different unacquainted observers.},

Abstract = {Classic theories of stress and health are largely based on assumptions
   regarding how different psychosocial stressors influence biological
   processes that, in turn, affect human health and behavior. Although
   theoretically rich, this work has yielded little consensus and led to
   numerous conceptual, measurement, and reproducibility issues. Social
   Safety Theory aims to address these issues by using the primary goal and
   regulatory logic of the human brain and immune system as the basis for
   specifying the social-environmental situations to which these systems
   should respond most strongly to maximize reproductive success and
   survival. This analysis gave rise to the integrated, multi-level
   formulation described herein, which transforms thinking about stress
   biology and provides a biologically based, evolutionary account for how
   and why experiences of social safety and social threat are strongly
   related to health, well-being, aging, and longevity. In doing so, the
   theory advances a testable framework for investigating the
   biopsychosocial roots of health disparities as well as how
   health-relevant biopsychosocial processes crystalize over time and how
   perceptions of the social environment interact with childhood microbial
   environment, birth cohort, culture, air pollution, genetics, sleep,
   diet, personality, and self-harm to affect health. The theory also
   highlights several interventions for reducing social threat and
   promoting resilience.},

Title = {How to improve the diet of toddlers? The feasibility of an online,
   habit-based intervention targeting parental feeding behaviour},

Abstract = {Background: The diet of toddlers is often not in accordance with dietary
   recommendations, putting them at risk of poor health outcomes later in
   life. Parents can struggle to provide their toddler with a healthy diet
   and interventions are needed. Helping parents to form healthy feeding
   habits may facilitate healthy feeding behaviours. Therefore, the aim of
   this study was to establish the feasibility of a 6-week online
   intervention to build healthy feeding behaviours in parents of toddlers.
   Methods: Parents and primary caregivers of children aged 2-3 (N = 75)
   were recruited to complete a 6-week online intervention consisting of 6
   modules targeting habit formation, planning, goal setting,
   self-efficacy, interpersonal influences and picky eating. Demographics
   and feeding behaviours were measured with self-report at baseline and
   follow-up. Intervention acceptability and feasibility ratings were also
   gathered post-intervention.
   Results: Most participants were recruited online, highly educated and in
   a relationship. After 6-weeks, 17 participants completed the follow-up
   questionnaire, 11 of whom indicated that they had completed the whole
   intervention. Improvements were found for some feeding behaviours.
   Generally, participants who completed the programme reported that they
   found it acceptable.
   Conclusions: This study provides insights for future intervention
   development. Firstly, an online healthy feeding intervention seems to be
   acceptable but may need to focus on fewer change techniques. Further,
   engagement should be improved by including target group members and
   compulsory reminders. The target behaviours seem to be relevant. Online
   recruitment seems to be preferable and reaches parents and primary
   caregivers nationwide.},

   midlife: initial feasibility testing},

Abstract = {Background: Physical activity during midlife (ages 45-64) plays a major
   role in the prevention of chronic and serious medical conditions.
   Unfortunately, many midlife adults struggle to be physically active in
   the setting of low levels of psychological well-being and the management
   of multiple confluent sources of stress. Effective, scalable,
   midlife-specific interventions are needed to promote physical activity
   and prevent the development of chronic medical conditions.
   Objectives: In an initial proof-of-concept trial, we assessed the
   feasibility and acceptability of a new, midlife-adapted, phone- and text
   message-based intervention using positive psychology (PP) skill-building
   and motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. We secondarily analyzed
   post-intervention changes in accelerometer-measured physical activity
   and self-reported outcomes.
   Methods: The PP-MI intervention included six weekly phone sessions with
   a study trainer, with completion of PP activities and physical activity
   goals between calls, and in the subsequent six weeks briefer phone
   check-ins were conducted. Text messages over the 12-week intervention
   period were utilized to support participants and identify barriers to
   goal completion. Feasibility (session completion rates) and
   acceptability (participant ratings of intervention ease and utility)
   were assessed via descriptive statistics, and pre-post improvements in
   psychological, functional, and physical activity outcomes at 12 weeks
   were examined via mixed effects regression models.
   Results: Twelve midlife adults with low baseline physical activity
   enrolled in the single-arm trial. Overall, 76.8\% of all possible
   sessions were completed by participants, and mean ratings of weekly
   phone sessions were 8.9/10 (SD 1.6), exceeding our a priori thresholds
   for feasibility and acceptability. Participants demonstrated generally
   medium to large effect size magnitude improvements in
   accelerometer-measured physical activity, psychological outcomes, and
   function.
   Conclusions: A novel, midlife-specific phone- and text-based PP-MI
   intervention was feasible and had promising effects on physical activity
   and other clinically relevant outcomes, supporting next-step testing of
   this program via a randomized controlled trial.},

Abstract = {Background Online communities and social networking sites have great
   potential for supporting health behavior change. However, interventions
   vary greatly in participants' engagement rates and, consequently, their
   effectiveness. Theory-based interventions in real-world contexts are
   needed to further increase engagement and effectiveness.
   Methods We experimentally tested whether a video intervention teaching
   Self-Determination-Theory-based communication strategies increases
   need-supportive communication strategy use over one week (Study 1, N =
   76) and perceived need support, engagement, and goal attainment in a
   behavior change intervention supported by a forum-based online community
   (Study 2, N = 537). In Study 2, participants chose a goal (increasing
   either fruit or vegetable consumption or increasing moderate or vigorous
   physical activity) and joined an online community for 2 weeks. Data from
   both experiments were analyzed with mixed models and follow-up tests.
   Results In Study 1, participants in the intervention but not in the
   control group showed an increase in the number of need-supportive
   communication strategies used both immediately and one week after the
   intervention (condition x time interaction, partial eta (2) = 0.31). In
   Study 2, participants who watched the intervention video had a higher
   number of postings and reported a higher subjective forum use frequency
   (but not a higher number of logins) compared to participants who watched
   the control video. However, the effect on the subjective forum visit
   frequency was not robust. There were no intervention effects on
   perceived need support, goal attainment, or secondary outcomes. The
   results might be explained by low application of need-supportive
   communication strategies.
   Conclusion A brief video intervention may be a suitable, low-cost
   intervention to promote need-supportive communication strategy use,
   benefitting both engagement and behavior change. Future studies should
   incorporate additional means to further improve communication strategy
   uptake and engagement in online communities.},

Abstract = {Objective: Family members of stroke survivors are often not supported
   for their caring role, with many reporting adjustment difficulties. This
   paper describes the development and content of a group-based
   intervention for informal carers of stroke survivors.
   Method: The intervention is based on the theoretical foundation of the
   biopsychosocial model with the aim to understand and address the
   physical, psychological and social factors of caring for stroke
   survivors. Findings from a comprehensive literature review and a
   qualitative study with carers arid stroke professionals were synthesized
   to guide the intervention development. The Template for Intervention
   Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist was used as a framework
   to describe the intervention.
   Results: The intervention integrates cognitive-behavioural approaches
   via the identification of the biopsychosocial (physical, emotional,
   social) factors that can have an impact on the well-being of carers. It
   includes education on stroke-specific topics and advice on coping
   strategies. It consists of six structured two-hour group sessions
   facilitated in a community setting. It provides information and support
   on adjusting to the caring role in the first year post-stroke.
   Intervention materials were designed for addressing carers' specific
   needs using psychological techniques, such as problem-solving, goal
   setting and relaxation exercises.
   Conclusion: We have underlined the importance for describing and
   reporting the process of intervention development for complex
   interventions in the context of stroke rehabilitation. An intervention
   addressing the needs of informal stroke carers (Biopsychosocial
   Intervention for Stroke Carers; BISC) has been developed and described.
   BISC was further evaluated in a single-centre feasibility randomized
   controlled trial.},

Abstract = {Background Behavior change interventions have a vital role in enhancing
   human health and well-being. Nevertheless, concerns have been raised
   about suboptimal reporting of behavior change interventions, making
   analyses, replications, and intervention re-use hard or impossible to
   conduct. Objective This paper introduces acyclic behavior change
   diagrams (ABCDs) to achieve more transparent development, evaluation,
   and reporting of behavior change interventions. ABCDs are a visual
   representation of the assumptions regarding causal-structural chains
   that underlie putative active ingredients of behavior change
   interventions. These causal-structural chains link the behavior change
   principles that are applied in an intervention to the (determinants of)
   behavior targeted in that intervention. Conclusions ABCDs are helpful in
   making implicit assumptions explicit and help communicate assumptions
   with team members and other stakeholders. Moreover, we believe they make
   evaluation easier, and their machine-readability allows for ABCDs to be
   imported directly into (systematic review) databases with negligible
   costs while disclosing complete and accurate data. Finally, the ABCD
   approach fits well with other initiatives to gain a deeper understanding
   and synthesis of the literature on active intervention elements.},

Title = {Using intervention mapping to develop and facilitate implementation of a
   multifaceted behavioural intervention targeting physical activity and
   sedentary behaviour in stroke survivors: Physical Activity Routines
   After Stroke (PARAS): intervention development study},

Abstract = {Objectives: The benefits of increased physical activity for stroke
   survivors include improved function and mental health and wellbeing.
   However, less than 30\% achieve recommended physical activity levels,
   and high levels of sedentary behaviour are reported. We developed a
   multifaceted behavioural intervention (and accompanying implementation
   plan) targeting physical activity and sedentary behaviour of stroke
   survivors.
   Design: Intervention Mapping facilitated intervention development. Step
   1 involved a systematic review, focus group discussions and a review of
   care pathways. Step 2 identified social cognitive determinants of
   behavioural change and behavioural outcomes. Step 3 linked determinants
   of behavioural outcomes with specific behaviour change techniques (BCTs)
   to target behaviours of interest. Step 4 involved intervention
   development informed by steps 1-3. Subsequently, an implementation plan
   was developed (Step 5) followed by an evaluation plan (Step 6).
   Setting: Community and secondary care settings, North East England.
   Participants: Stroke survivors and healthcare professionals (HCPs)
   working in stroke services.
   Results: Systematic review findings informed selection of nine
   `promising' BCTs (e.g. problem-solving). Focus groups with stroke
   survivors (n =18) and HCPs (n = 24) identified the need for an
   intervention delivered throughout the rehabilitation pathway, tailored
   to individual needs with training for HCPs delivering the intervention.
   Intervention delivery was considered feasible within local stroke
   services. The target behaviours for the intervention were levels of
   physical activity and sedentary behaviour in adult stroke survivors.
   Assessment of acceptability and usability with 11 HCPs and 21 stroke
   survivors/relatives identified issues with self-monitoring tools and the
   need for a physical activity repository of local services' and training
   for HCPs with feedback on intervention delivery. A feasibility study
   protocol was designed to evaluate the intervention.
   Conclusions: A systematic development process using intervention mapping
   resulted in a multi-faceted evidence- and theory-informed intervention
   (Physical Activity Routines After Stroke - PARAS) for delivery by
   community stroke rehabilitation teams.},

Title = {The ``Family Health = Family Wealth{''} intervention: study protocol for

Abstract = {Background: Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates globally, but
   only 30\% of women report using an effective method of contraception.
   Community-based, multi-level interventions are needed to help couples in
   rural Uganda overcome barriers to contraceptive use.Methods: This study
   will pilot test the Family Health = Family Wealth intervention, a
   multi-level, community-based intervention employing transformative
   community dialogues, which use facilitated discussion to reshape
   community norms that influence family planning acceptance, to alter
   individual attitudes and the perception of community norms that
   discourage family planning. Community dialogues are delivered to groups
   of couples over 4 sessions (two gender-segregated and two gender-mixed).
   Sessions simultaneously address individual and interpersonal-level
   determinants of family planning and link couples to family planning
   services. At the health system level, a refresher training will be
   conducted with health workers in the intervention community's health
   center to address gaps in contraceptive knowledge and skills as
   identified from a needs assessment.The intervention will be evaluated
   through a pilot quasi-experimental trial paired with a mixed methods
   process evaluation. Participants include 70 couples (N=140) randomized
   by community to the Family Health = Family Wealth intervention (n=35
   couples) or to an attention-matched water, sanitation, and hygiene
   (WASH) intervention (n=35 couples). Participants include sexually
   active, married couples who are age 18 (or an emancipated minor) to 40
   for women and age 18 (or an emancipated minor) to 50 for men, not
   pregnant, at least one person in the couple reports wanting to avoid
   pregnancy for at least a year, and not currently using a method of
   contraception or using a low-efficacy or ineffective method of
   contraception. The primary aims of the study are to (1) assess the
   feasibility of the intervention trial procedures, (2) the acceptability
   and feasibility of the intervention content and structure, and (3)
   explore the intervention's preliminary effectiveness at increasing
   contraceptive use and affecting related outcomes among
   couples.Discussion: Filling the unmet need for family planning has
   important public health implications, including reductions in
   pregnancy-related health risks and deaths, and infant mortality. This
   pilot intervention trial will gather preliminary evidence on the
   acceptability, feasibility, and potential effect of a novel,
   multi-level, community-based intervention to increase contraceptive use
   among couples with an unmet need for family planning in rural Uganda. We
   aim to use the findings of this pilot study to refine the trial
   procedures and intervention content for a future, larger cluster
   randomized controlled trial to establish the intervention's efficacy.},

Abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity and unhealthy dietary habits are known
   to be disadvantageous for the development of late adverse effects in
   survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer. To make
   interventions, aimed at improving lifestyle, fit into the daily life of
   survivors, interventions should be designed and delivered in a
   person-centred way with a limited time burden. As part of the European
   PanCareFollowUp project, an eHealth intervention was developed to
   support sustainable changes to physical activity levels and/or diet of
   childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer survivors. This
   feasibility study aims to gain insight into the feasibility and
   potential effect sizes of the PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention.
   Methods: The PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention consists of
   person-centred 3-6 screen-to-screen sessions with a certified lifestyle
   coach. The intervention will be evaluated with a single-arm pre-post
   feasibility study conducted at two survivorship care clinics in the
   Netherlands. A total of 60 participants who are (i) diagnosed with
   cancer < 25 years, (ii) \& GE; 5 years post-treatment, (iii) aged 16-55
   years, and (iv) have a low physical activity level and/or unhealthy
   dietary intake manifested by overweight will be recruited. Using
   reports, hospital records, and questionnaires for survivors, coaches,
   and late effect doctors, feasibility will be based on (i) adherence to
   intervention, (ii) acceptability, (iii) practicality, (iv)
   integration/implementation, (v) demand, and (vi) attrition. The
   potential effect sizes of the intervention will be explored by
   determining the percentage of survivors that reach the personalized
   lifestyle goals that were set with the coach. Physical activity level,
   dietary intake, BMI, general self-efficacy, self-management, and
   motivation level will be assessed at three time points with
   questionnaires, reports, and/or an accelerometer. Discussion: Data of
   this study will be gathered to assess the feasibility and potential
   effect sizes. This will allow for further intervention refinement as
   needed as well as to inform a future large-scale intervention study and
   a manual for implementation at other centres.},

Abstract = {Background To our knowledge, there is no intervention which includes
   personalised exercise therapy and self-management support for people
   with multimorbidity, although these interventions may be as effective as
   for people with single chronic conditions. Therefore, we developed a
   novel intervention, including personalised exercise therapy and
   self-management support for people with multimorbidity. Methods We
   followed the Medical Research Council framework and conducted one
   scoping review, five systematic reviews, two registry-based studies, one
   qualitative interview study and a mixed-methods feasibility study.
   Following an iterative approach, together with feedback from people with
   multimorbidity and relevant stakeholders, we developed the MOBILIZE
   intervention. Results The intervention included 24 (60 minutes) sessions
   of personalised exercise therapy and 24 (30 minutes) sessions of
   self-management support twice a week for 12 weeks, delivered in small
   groups by specifically trained physiotherapists. The intervention
   targets physiological, psychosocial, behavioural, and contextual factors
   to improve health-related quality of life and physical function in
   people living with multimorbidity. Conclusions We developed a
   personalised exercise therapy and self-management support programme for
   people with multimorbidity. The intervention will be tested for its
   safety and effectiveness in a randomised controlled trial.},

Abstract = {Background The Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model
   (PRISM) was developed in 2008 as a contextually expanded version of the
   broadly used Reach, Adoption, Effectiveness, Implementation, and
   Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. PRISM provides researchers a pragmatic
   and intuitive model to improve translation of research interventions
   into clinical and community practice. Since 2008, the use of PRISM
   increased across diverse topics, populations, and settings. This
   citation analysis and scoping systematic review aimed to assess the use
   of the PRISM framework and to make recommendations for future research.
   Methods A literature search was conducted using three databases (PubMed,
   Web of Science, Scopus) for the period of 2008 and September 2020. After
   exclusion, reverse citation searches and invitations to experts in the
   field were used to identify and obtain recommendations for additional
   articles not identified in the original search. Studies that integrated
   PRISM into their study design were selected for full abstraction. Unique
   research studies were abstracted for information on study
   characteristics (e.g., setting/population, design), PRISM contextual
   domains, and RE-AIM outcomes. Results A total of 180 articles were
   identified to include PRISM to some degree. Thirty-two articles
   representing 23 unique studies integrated PRISM within their study
   design. Study characteristics varied widely and included studies
   conducted in diverse contexts, but predominately in high-income
   countries and in clinical out-patient settings. With regards to use, 19
   used PRISM for evaluation, 10 for planning/development, 10 for
   implementation, four for sustainment, and one for dissemination. There
   was substantial variation across studies in how and to what degree PRISM
   contextual domains and RE-AIM outcomes were operationalized and
   connected. Only two studies directly connected individual PRISM context
   domains with RE-AIM outcomes, and another four included RE-AIM outcomes
   without direct connection to PRISM domains. Conclusions This is the
   first systematic review of the use of PRISM in various contexts. While
   there were low levels of `integrated' use of PRISM and few reports on
   linkage to RE-AIM outcomes, most studies included important context
   domains of implementation and sustainability infrastructure and external
   environment. Recommendations are provided for more consistent and
   comprehensive use of and reporting on PRISM to inform both research and
   practice on contextual factors in implementation.},

Abstract = {Background: Having a stammer can have a significant effect on a child's
   social, emotional and educational development. With approximately 66,000
   children in the UK having a stammer, there is a need to establish an
   adequate evidence base to inform clinical practice. We describe a
   feasibility trial to explore the effectiveness of a new therapy
   programme for children aged 8-14: Palin Stammering Therapy for School
   Children (Palin STSC(8-14)). Preliminary data from the Michael Palin
   Centre, where the programme was developed, indicate that Palin
   STSC(8-14) is effective in reducing stammering frequency and impact for
   children, with beneficial effects for parents too. We will investigate
   the feasibility of the methods required for a definitive randomised
   controlled trial to investigate the application of this therapy by NHS
   speech and language therapists (SLTs), compared with `treatment as
   usual' (TAU), beyond the specialist context in which it was developed.
   Methods: This is a two-arm feasibility cluster-randomised controlled
   trial of Palin STSC(8-14) with TAU control arm, and randomisation at the
   level of the SLT. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected to
   examine the following: the recruitment and retention of therapists and
   families, the acceptability of the research processes and the
   therapeutic intervention and the appropriateness of the therapy outcome
   measures. Assessments will be completed by children and parents at
   baseline and 6 months later, including measures of stammering severity;
   the impact of child's stammering on both children and parents; child
   temperament, behaviour and peer relations, anxiety; quality of life; and
   economic outcomes. There will also be a qualitative process evaluation,
   including interviews with parents, children, SLTs and SLT managers to
   explore the acceptability of both the research and therapy methods.
   Treatment fidelity will be examined through analysis of therapy session
   records and recordings.
   Discussion: The findings of this feasibility trial will inform the
   decision as to whether to progress to a full-scale randomised controlled
   trial to explore the effectiveness of Palin STSC(8-14) when compared to
   Treatment as Usual in NHS SLT services. There is a strong need for an
   evidence-based intervention for school age children who stammer.},

Title = {Michigan Model for Health™ Learning to Enhance and Adapt for Prevention
   (Mi-LEAP): protocol of a pilot randomized trial comparing Enhanced
   Replicating Effective Programs versus standard implementation to deliver
   an evidence-based drug use prevention curriculum},

Abstract = {Background: School-based drug use prevention programs have demonstrated
   notable potential to reduce the onset and escalation of drug use,
   including among youth at risk of poor outcomes such as those exposed to
   trauma. Researchers have found a robust relationship between
   intervention fidelity and participant (i.e., student) outcomes.
   Effective implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as the
   Michigan Model for Health(TM) (MMH), is critical to achieving desired
   public health objectives. Yet, a persistent gap remains in what we know
   works and how to effectively translate these findings into routine
   practice. The objective of this study is to design and test a
   multi-component implementation strategy to tailor MMH to meet population
   needs (i.e., students exposed to trauma), and improve the
   population-context fit to enhance fidelity and effectiveness.
   Methods: Using a 2-group, mixed-method randomized controlled trial
   design, this study will compare standard implementation versus Enhanced
   Replicating Effective Programs (REP) to deliver MMH. REP is a
   theoretically based implementation strategy that promotes evidence-based
   intervention (EBI) fidelity through a combination of EBI curriculum
   packaging, training, and as-needed technical assistance and is
   consistent with standard MMH implementation. Enhanced REP will tailor
   the intervention and training to integrate trauma-informed approaches
   and deploy customized implementation support (i.e., facilitation). The
   research will address the following specific aims: (1) design and test
   an implementation strategy (Enhanced REP) to deliver the MMH versus
   standard implementation and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and
   appropriateness using mixed methods, (2) estimate the costs and
   cost-effectiveness of Enhanced REP to deliver MMH versus standard
   implementation.
   Discussion: This research will design and test a multi-component
   implementation strategy focused on enhancing the fit between the
   intervention and population needs while maintaining fidelity to MMH core
   functions. We focus on the feasibility of deploying the implementation
   strategy bundle and costing methods and preliminary information on cost
   input distributions. The substantive focus on youth at heightened risk
   of drug use and its consequences due to trauma exposure is significant
   because of the public health impact of prevention. Pilot studies of
   implementation strategies are underutilized and can provide vital
   information on designing and testing effective strategies by addressing
   potential design and methods uncertainties and the effects of the
   implementation strategy on implementation and student outcomes.},

Abstract = {Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition of the central
   nervous system, affecting around 1 in every 600 people in the UK, with
   130 new diagnoses every week. Cognitive difficulties are common amongst
   people with MS, with up to 70\% experiencing deficits in higher-level
   brain functions-such as planning and problem-solving, attention, and
   memory. Cognitive deficits make it difficult for people with MS to
   complete everyday tasks and limit their abilities to work, socialise,
   and live independently. There is a clear need-and recognised research
   priority-for treatments that can improve cognitive functioning in people
   with MS. The absence of effective cognitive interventions exacerbates
   burdens on the services accessed by people with MS-requiring these
   services to manage sequelae of untreated cognitive deficits, including
   reduced quality of life, greater disability and dependence, and poorer
   adherence to disease-modifying treatments. Our planned research will
   fill the evidence gap through developing-and examining the feasibility
   of trialling-a novel online cognitive rehabilitation programme for
   people with MS (SMART). The SMART programme directly trains relational
   skills (the ability to flexibly relate concepts to one another) based on
   theory that these skills are critical to broader cognitive functioning.
   Methods The primary objective of this study aims to conduct a
   feasibility study to inform the development of a definitive trial of
   SMART for improving cognitive functioning in people with MS. The
   secondary objective is to develop the framework for a cost-effectiveness
   analysis alongside a definitive trial, and the exploratory objective is
   to assess the signal of efficacy. Discussion As a feasibility trial,
   outcomes are unlikely to immediately effect changes to NHS practice.
   However, this is a necessary step towards developing a definitive
   trial-and will give us a signal of efficacy, a prerequisite for
   progression to a definitive trial. If found to be clinically and
   cost-effective, the latter trial could create a step-change in MS
   cognitive rehabilitation-improving service delivery and optimising
   support with limited additional resources.},

Abstract = {Adolescents exposed to high levels of adversity are vulnerable to
   developing mental health challenges, with long-lasting adverse
   consequences. Promoting the psychological well-being of adolescents and
   protecting them from adverse experiences is crucial for their quality of
   life. There is a need for evidence on which combinations of protective
   factors can improve the wellbeing of adolescents to inform future
   programming efforts. We used data from a longitudinal study that took
   place in Khayelitsha, South Africa, a semi-urban impoverished community
   in Cape Town. Data were collected from adolescents when they were 12-14
   years of age (n = 333) and again at follow-up when they were aged 16-19
   years (n = 314). A path analysis was used to estimate associations
   between access to service, food security, safe environment, family
   support, and social support and five outcomes related to adolescent
   mental health and risky behaviours. The fitted model was used to
   calculate adjusted mean differences comparing different combinations of
   risk factors. Two protective factors (food security and safe
   environment) were positively associated with three outcomes relating to
   mental health and the absence of risky behaviours. Further investigation
   revealed that the presence of high food security and safer environments
   was associated with higher adjusted mean scores: +16.2\% (p < .0001) in
   no substance use; +16.5\% (p < .0001) in no internalising behaviour,
   +19.5\% (p < .0001) in self-esteem; +12.2\% (p < .0001) in positive peer
   relationships; and +11.4\% (p < .0001) in no suicidal ideation.
   Interventions targeting adolescents, that aim to improve food security
   together with improving the safety of their environment, are likely to
   impact their well-being.},

Title = {Love Together, Parent Together (L2P2): a protocol for a feasibility
   study of a conflict reappraisal writing intervention for interparental
   couples with young children},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced or amplified stress and
   challenge within couples' relationships. Among those who are
   particularly vulnerable to heightened conflict and lower relationship
   satisfaction during this time are interparental couples with young
   children, whose relationships may have already been tenuous prior to the
   pandemic. Stress within the interparental relationship may have ripple
   effects on all family subsystems and child adjustment. The Love Together
   Parent Together (L2P2) program is a brief, low-intensity writing
   intervention adapted for parents of young children that was designed to
   reduce conflict-related distress and prevent declines in relationship
   satisfaction. Based on an original writing intervention by Finkel and
   colleagues, L2P2 has adapted the intervention duration and study
   population to be appropriate to the current global context. This study
   will examine the key feasibility metrics related to this adapted program
   with the goal of identifying problems and informing parameters of future
   pilot and/or main RCTs.
   Methods: The current study is a non-randomized feasibility study, using
   a single-arm, pre-test/post-test design to primarily assess the
   feasibility of an evaluative RCT, and to secondarily assess the
   potential effects on outcomes to be used in a future RCT. Couples will
   be recruited through three community-based agencies with the goal of
   obtaining a socio-demographically diverse sample. The first 20 couples
   to enroll will be included. Baseline and post-intervention surveys will
   be conducted, and a writing intervention will take place (three 7-min
   sessions over the course of 5 weeks). The primary outcomes will be
   feasibility metrics of recruitment rates, appropriateness of eligibility
   criteria, sample diversity, retention, uptake, adherence, and
   acceptability. In addition, we will develop an objective measure of
   couple ``we-ness{''} based on an analysis of writing samples. The
   secondary outcomes will include couples' measures (i.e., relationship
   quality, perceived partner responsiveness, self-reported responsiveness,
   conflict-related distress), and additional family outcomes (i.e.,
   parent-child relations, parental/child mental health). Criteria for
   success are outlined, and failure to meet the criteria will result in
   adaptations to the measurement schedule, intervention design,
   recruitment approach, and/or other elements of the program.
   Discussion: This feasibility study will inform several components of the
   procedures used for a subsequent pilot RCT, in which we will examine the
   feasibility of the methodology used to evaluate the program (e.g.,
   randomization, attrition to follow-up assessment/across groups, and
   sample size estimation, preliminary effectiveness), as well as the main
   RCT, which will investigate the effectiveness of the intervention on
   primary outcome measures and mediating pathways.},

Abstract = {Background: The USA is undergoing a suicide epidemic for its youngest
   Veterans (18-to-34-years-old) as their suicide rate has almost doubled
   since 2001. Veterans are at the highest risk during their first-year
   post-discharge, thus creating a ``deadly gap.{''} In response, the
   nation has developed strategies that emphasize a preventive, universal,
   and public health approach and embrace the value of community
   interventions. The three-step theory of suicide suggests that community
   interventions that reduce reintegration difficulties and promote
   connectedness for Veterans as they transition to civilian life have the
   greatest likelihood of reducing suicide. Recent research shows that the
   effectiveness of community interventions can be enhanced when augmented
   by volunteer and certified sponsors (1-on-1) who actively engage with
   Veterans, as part of the Veteran Sponsorship Initiative (VSI).
   Method/design: The purpose of this randomized hybrid type 2
   effectiveness-implementation trial is to evaluate the implementation of
   the VSI in six cities in Texas in collaboration with the US Departments
   of Defense, Labor and Veterans Affairs, Texas government, and local
   stakeholders. Texas is an optimal location for this large-scale
   implementation as it has the second largest population of these young
   Veterans and is home to the largest US military installation, Fort Hood.
   The first aim is to determine the effectiveness of the VSI, as evidenced
   by measures of reintegration difficulties, health/psychological
   distress, VA healthcare utilization, connectedness, and suicidal risk.
   The second aim is to determine the feasibility and potential utility of
   a stakeholder-engaged plan for implementing the VSI in Texas with the
   intent of future expansion in more states. The evaluators will use a
   stepped wedge design with a sequential roll-out to participating cities
   over time. Participants (n=630) will be enrolled on military
   installations six months prior to discharge. Implementation efforts will
   draw upon a bundled implementation strategy that includes strategies
   such as ongoing training, implementation facilitation, and audit and
   feedback. Formative and summative evaluations will be guided by the
   Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM)
   framework and will include interviews with participants and periodic
   reflections with key stakeholders to longitudinally identify barriers
   and facilitators to implementation.
   Discussion: This evaluation will have important implications for the
   national implementation of community interventions that address the
   epidemic of Veteran suicide. Aligned with the Evidence Act, it is the
   first large-scale implementation of an evidence-based practice that
   conducts a thorough assessment of TSMVs during the ``deadly gap.{''}},

Title = {Forming New Health Behavior Habits During Weight Loss Maintenance-The
   PREVIEW Study},

Abstract = {Introduction: Changing lifestyle habits to achieve and maintain weight
   loss can be effective in prevention of Type II diabetes. Ability to
   resist temptations is considered one of the key factors in behavior
   change. This study examined how habit strength, motivation, and
   temptations for an energy-dense diet developed during the maintenance
   stage of a behavior modification intervention tool. Method: Participants
   with prediabetes and overweight/obesity were recruited in the two-phase
   trial PREVIEW with the aim to achieve >= 8\% body weight loss over 2
   months and maintain weight loss over a subsequent 34-month period. The
   four-stage intervention (PREVIEW Behavior Modification Intervention
   Toolbox, or PREMIT) supported participants in weight maintenance. Uni-
   and multivariate analyses were completed from the beginning of the
   PREMIT maintenance stage (Week 26 of the PREVIEW trial) with 962
   individuals who completed the trial. Results: Habit strength and ability
   to resist temptations increased during the early PREMIT adherence stage
   (Weeks 26 to 52) before plateauing during middle (Weeks 52 to 104) and
   late (Weeks 104 to 156) PREMIT adherence stages. Higher habit strength
   for energy-dense diet was significantly associated with larger weight
   regain (p <= .007). No changes in motivation or interactions with PREMIT
   attendance were observed. Discussion: Changing diet habits is a complex,
   multifactorial process, with participants struggling at least with some
   aspects of weight maintenance. Habits against consuming energy-dense,
   sweet, and fatty food appeared effective in protecting against weight
   regain. The observed effect sizes were small, reflecting the complexity
   of breaking old habits and forming new ones to support long-term
   maintenance of weight loss.},

Abstract = {Introduction Deaths from second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure are
   increasing, but there is not sufficient evidence to recommend a
   particular SHS intervention or intervention development approach.
   Despite the available guidance on intervention reporting, and on the
   role and nature of pilot and feasibility studies, partial reporting of
   SHS interventions is common. The decision-making whilst developing such
   interventions is often under-reported. This paper describes the
   processes and decisions employed during transitioning from the aim of
   adapting an existing mosque-based intervention focused on public health
   messages, to the development of the content of novel community-based
   Smoke-Free Home (SFH) intervention. The intervention aims to promote
   smoke-free homes to reduce non-smokers' exposure to SHS in the home via
   faith-based messages. Methods The development of the SFH intervention
   had four sequential phases: in-depth interviews with adults in
   households in Dhaka, identification of an intervention programme theory
   and content with Islamic scholars from the Bangladesh Islamic Foundation
   (BIF), user testing of candidate intervention content with adults, and
   iterative intervention development workshops with Imams and khatibs who
   trained at the BIF. Results It was judged inappropriately to take an
   intervention adaptation approach. Following the identification of an
   intervention programme theory and collaborating with stakeholders in an
   iterative and collaborative process to identify barriers, six
   potentially modifiable constructs were identified. These were targeted
   with a series of behaviour change techniques operationalised as Quranic
   verses with associated health messages to be used as the basis for
   Khutbahs. Following iterative user testing, acceptable intervention
   content was generated. Conclusion The potential of this community-based
   intervention to reduce SHS exposure at home and improve lung health
   among non-smokers in Bangladesh is the result of an iterative and
   collaborative process. It is the result of the integration of behaviour
   change evidence and theory and community stakeholder contributions to
   the production of the intervention content. This novel combination of
   intervention development frameworks demonstrates a flexible approach
   that could provide insights for intervention development in related
   contexts.},

Title = {Development and evaluation of a remote training strategy for the
   implementation of mental health evidence-based practices in rural
   schools: pilot study protocol},

Abstract = {Background An increasing number of schools in rural settings are
   implementing multi-tier positive behavioral interventions and supports
   (PBIS) to address school-climate problems. PBIS can be used to provide
   the framework for the implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs)
   to address children's mental health concerns. Given the large service
   disparities for children in rural areas, offering EBPs through PBIS can
   improve access and lead to better long-term outcomes. A key challenge is
   that school personnel need technical assistance in order to implement
   EBPs with fidelity and clinical effectiveness. Providing ongoing on-site
   support is not feasible or sustainable in the majority of rural schools,
   due to their remote physical location. For this reason, remote training
   technology has been recommended for providing technical assistance to
   behavioral health staff (BHS) in under-served rural communities.
   Objectives The purpose of this study is to use the user-centered design,
   guided by an iterative process (rapid prototyping), to develop and
   evaluate the appropriateness, feasibility, acceptability, usability, and
   preliminary student outcomes of two online training strategies for the
   implementation of EBPs at PBIS Tier 2. Methods The study will employ a
   pragmatic design comprised of a mixed-methods approach for the
   development of the training platform, and a hybrid type 2, pilot
   randomized controlled trial to examine the implementation and student
   outcomes of two training strategies: Remote Video vs. Remote Video plus
   Coaching. Discussion There is a clear need for well-designed remote
   training studies focused on training in non-traditional settings. Given
   the lack of well-trained mental health professionals in rural settings
   and the stark disparities in access to services, the development and
   pilot-testing of a remote training strategy for BHS in under-served
   rural schools could have a significant public health impact. Ethics and
   dissemination The project was reviewed and approved by the institutional
   review board. Results will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov and
   disseminated to community partners and participants, peer-reviewed
   journals, and academic conferences.},

Title = {Implementation strategy in collaboration with people with lived
   experience of mental illness to reduce stigma among primary care
   providers in Nepal (RESHAPE): protocol for a type 3 hybrid
   implementation effectiveness cluster randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Background: There are increasing efforts for the integration of mental
   health services into primary care settings in low- and middle-income
   countries. However, commonly used approaches to train primary care
   providers (PCPs) may not achieve the expected outcomes for improved
   service delivery, as evidenced by low detection rates of mental
   illnesses after training. One contributor to this shortcoming is the
   stigma among PCPs. Implementation strategies for training PCPs that
   reduce stigma have the potential to improve the quality of services.
   Design: In Nepal, a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness cluster
   randomized controlled trial will evaluate the implementation-as-usual
   training for PCPs compared to an alternative implementation strategy to
   train PCPs, entitled Reducing Stigma among Healthcare Providers
   (RESHAPE). In implementation-as-usual, PCPs are trained on the World
   Health Organization Mental Health Gap Action Program Intervention Guide
   (mhGAP-IG) with trainings conducted by mental health specialists. In
   RESHAPE, mhGAP-IG training includes the added component of facilitation
   by people with lived experience of mental illness (PWLE) and their
   caregivers using PhotoVoice, as well as aspirational figures. The
   duration of PCP training is the same in both arms. Co-primary outcomes
   of the study are stigma among PCPs, as measured with the Social Distance
   Scale at 6 months post-training, and reach, a domain from the RE-AIM
   implementation science framework. Reach is operationalized as the
   accuracy of detection of mental illness in primary care facilities and
   will be determined by psychiatrists at 3 months after PCPs diagnose the
   patients. Stigma will be evaluated as a mediator of reach.
   Cost-effectiveness and other RE-AIM outcomes will be assessed.
   Twenty-four municipalities, the unit of clustering, will be randomized
   to either mhGAP-IG implementation-as-usual or RESHAPE arms, with
   approximately 76 health facilities and 216 PCPs divided equally between
   arms. An estimated 1100 patients will be enrolled for the evaluation of
   accurate diagnosis of depression, generalized anxiety disorder,
   psychosis, or alcohol use disorder. Masking will include PCPs, patients,
   and psychiatrists.
   Discussion: This study will advance the knowledge of stigma reduction
   for training PCPs in partnership with PWLE. This collaborative approach
   to training has the potential to improve diagnostic competencies. If
   successful, this implementation strategy could be scaled up throughout
   low-resource settings to reduce the global treatment gap for mental
   illness.},

Abstract = {Background: Community- and strengths-based psychosocial interventions
   are central to mental health and psychosocial support guidelines, but
   rigorous evidence regarding the effectiveness of these interventions is
   limited. The complexity and variability that is inherent to many
   community-based psychosocial interventions requires innovative
   strategies in order to facilitate the comparability and synthesis across
   research studies without compromising the fit and appropriateness of
   interventions to specific study populations and context. Entre Nosotras
   is a community-based psychosocial intervention developed for migrant and
   host community women that is designed to be flexible enough to enable
   integration of external intervention components and adaptable to diverse
   study contexts and populations. This protocol describes a study that
   aims to evaluate the appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility of
   integrating a standardized stress management intervention into Entre
   Nosotras.
   Methods: This study will evaluate the appropriateness, acceptability,
   feasibility, and safety of intervention and research procedures for a
   cluster randomized comparative effectiveness trial conducted in Ecuador
   and Panama with migrant and host community women. In this feasibility
   trial, we will allocate communities nested within the three study sites
   to the integrated Entre Nosotras + stress management intervention versus
   Entre Nosotras alone through stratified randomization. Migrant and host
   community women residing in these study communities who report low to
   moderate levels of distress will be allocated to the intervention
   condition that their community is assigned (n = 220 total). We will
   collect quantitative measures of psychosocial wellbeing, psychological
   distress, coping, social support, and functioning from study
   participants. We will collect quantitative measures of fidelity and
   facilitator competencies through observation and facilitator
   self-assessment. Data on appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility,
   and safety will be gathered from participants and facilitators through
   quantitative assessments at 0, 5, and 10 weeks post-enrollment and
   qualitative interviews conducted with all facilitators and a subset of
   70 study participants during the post-intervention follow-up period.
   Discussion: Results from this feasibility trial will determine whether a
   multi-site cluster randomized comparative effectiveness trial of an
   adaptable community-based psychosocial intervention for migrant and host
   community women is relevant, acceptable, and feasible.},

Abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity is a main cause of childhood obesity
   which tracks into adulthood obesity, making it important to address
   early in life. Physical activity on prescription (PAP) is an
   evidence-based intervention that has shown good effect on physical
   activity levels in adults, but has not been evaluated in children with
   obesity. This project aims to evaluate the prerequisites, determinants,
   and feasibility of implementing PAP adapted to children with obesity and
   to explore children's, parents', and healthcare providers' experiences
   of PAP.
   Methods: In the first phase of the project, healthcare providers and
   managers from 26 paediatric clinics in Region Vastra Gotaland, Sweden,
   will be invited to participate in a web-based survey and a subset of
   this sample for a focus group study. Findings from these two data
   collections will form the basis for adaptation of PAP to the target
   group and context. In a second phase, this adapted PAP intervention will
   be evaluated in a clinical study in a sample of approximately 60
   children with obesity (ISO-BMI > 30) between 6 and 12 years of age and
   one of their parents/legal guardians. Implementation process and
   clinical outcomes will be assessed pre- and post-intervention and at 8
   and 12 months' follow-up. Implementation outcomes are the four core
   constructs of the Normalization Process Theory; coherence, cognitive
   participation, collective action, and reflexive monitoring; and
   appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility of the PAP intervention.
   Additional implementation process outcomes are recruitment and attrition
   rates, intervention fidelity, dose, and adherence. Clinical outcomes are
   physical activity pattern, BMI, metabolic risk factors, health-related
   quality of life, sleep, and self-efficacy and motivation for physical
   activity. Lastly, we will explore the perspectives of children and
   parents in semi-structured interviews. Design and analysis of the
   included studies are guided by the Normalization Process Theory.
   Discussion: This project will provide new knowledge regarding the
   feasibility of PAP for children with obesity and about whether and how
   an evidence-based intervention can be fitted and adapted to new contexts
   and populations. The results may inform a larger scale trial and future
   implementation and may enhance the role of PAP in the management of
   obesity in paediatric health care in Sweden.},

Title = {Trialling a microbiome-targeted dietary intervention in children with
   ADHD-the rationale and a non-randomised feasibility study},

Abstract = {Background: Dietary interventions have been previously explored in
   children with ADHD. Elimination diets and supplementation can produce
   beneficial behaviour changes, but little is known about the mechanisms
   mediating change. We propose that these interventions may work, in part,
   by causing changes in the gut microbiota. A microbiome-targeted dietary
   intervention was developed, and its feasibility assessed.
   Methods: A non-randomised feasibility study was conducted on nine
   non-medicated children with ADHD, aged 8-13 years (mean 10.39 years),
   using a prospective one-group pre-test/post-test design. Participants
   were recruited from ADHD support groups in London and took part in the
   6-week microbiome-targeted dietary intervention, which was specifically
   designed to impact the composition of gut bacteria. Children were
   assessed pre- and post-intervention on measures of ADHD symptomatology,
   cognition, sleep, gut function and stool-sample microbiome analysis. The
   primary aim was to assess the study completion rate, with secondary aims
   assessing adherence, adverse events (aiming for no severe and minimal),
   acceptability and suitability of outcome measures.
   Results: Recruitment proved to be challenging and despite targeting 230
   participants directly through support groups, and many more through
   social media, nine families (of the planned 10) signed up for the trial.
   The completion rate for the study was excellent at 100\%. Exploration of
   secondary aims revealed that (1) adherence to each aspect of the dietary
   protocol was very good; (2) two mild adverse events were reported; (3)
   parents rated the treatment as having good acceptability; (4) data
   collection and outcome measures were broadly feasible for use in an RCT
   with a few suggestions recommended; (5) descriptive data for outcome
   measures is presented and suggests that further exploration of gut
   microbiota, ADHD symptoms and sleep would be helpful in future research.
   Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for the
   feasibility of a microbiome-targeted dietary intervention in children
   with ADHD. Recruitment was challenging, but the diet itself was
   well-tolerated and adherence was very good. Families wishing to trial
   this diet may find it an acceptable intervention. However, recruitment,
   even for this small pilot study, was challenging. Because of the
   difficulty experienced recruiting participants, future randomised
   controlled trials may wish to adopt a simpler dietary approach which
   requires less parental time and engagement, in order to recruit the
   number of participants required to make meaningful statistical
   interpretations of efficacy.},

Title = {Health systems strengthening interventions for perinatal common mental
   disorders and experiences of domestic violence in Cape Town, South
   Africa: protocol for a pilot implementation study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Background: During the perinatal period, common mental disorders (CMDs)
   such as depression and anxiety are highly prevalent, especially in
   low-resource settings, and are associated with domestic violence,
   poverty, and food insecurity. Perinatal CMDs have been associated with
   several adverse maternal and child outcomes. While the Department of
   Health in South Africa provides healthcare workers with the tools to
   detect psychological distress and experiences of domestic violence, few
   healthcare workers routinely screen pregnant women at clinic visits,
   citing discomfort with mental health issues and the lack of standardised
   referral pathways as the key barriers. The aim of this study is to
   select and evaluate a set of health systems strengthening (HSS)
   interventions aimed at improving the care and outcomes for perinatal
   women with CMDs and experiences of domestic violence, attending public
   healthcare facilities in Cape Town.
   Methods: This study consists of a pre-implementation, development, and
   implementation phase. Contextual barriers identified during the
   pre-implementation phase included poor patient knowledge and
   health-seeking behaviour, high levels of stigma, and poor detection,
   referral, and treatment rates. Implementation science determinant
   frameworks were applied to findings from the pre-implementation phase to
   identify determinants and gaps in delivering high-quality
   evidence-informed care. A participatory Theory of Change workshop was
   used to design a HSS programme, consisting of awareness raising,
   detection, referral, and treatment. HSS interventions selected to
   support the delivery of the HSS programme includes training, health
   promotion, change to the healthcare environment, task-sharing, audit and
   feedback, and performance monitoring. The implementation phase will be
   used to assess several implementation and clinical outcomes associated
   with the delivery of the HSS programme, which will be piloted at three
   healthcare facilities. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used
   to evaluate the implementation and clinical outcomes.
   Discussion: This pilot implementation study will inform us about a range
   of implementation and clinical outcome measures that are relevant for
   assessing HSS interventions for perinatal women with depression,
   anxiety, or experiences of domestic violence in low-resource settings.
   Lessons learnt from the pilot study will be incorporated into the design
   of a cluster randomised control trial for which further funding will be
   sought.},

Title = {Suubi4Stigma study protocol: a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial
   to address HIV-associated stigma among adolescents living with HIV in
   Uganda},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Background: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is heavily burdened by HIV, with
   85\% of the global new infections among adolescents happening in the
   region. With advances in medication and national policies promoting
   antiretroviral therapy (ART), children < 15 years living with HIV (CLWH)
   continue to grow with a chronic, highly stigmatized disease.
   Unfortunately, the stigma they experience results in much lower quality
   of life, including poor mental health and treatment outcomes. Family
   members also experience stigma and shame by virtue of their association
   with an HIV-infected family member. Yet, stigma-reduction interventions
   targeting CLWH and their families are very limited. The goal of this
   study is to address HIV-associated stigma among CLWH and their
   caregivers in Uganda.
   Methods: This three-arm cluster randomized control trial, known as
   Suubi4Stigma, will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
   preliminary impact of two evidence-based interventions: (1) group
   cognitive behavioral therapy (G-CBT) focused on cognitive restructuring
   and strengthening coping skills at the individual level and (2) a
   multiple family group (MFG) intervention that strengthens family
   relationships to address stigma among CLWH (N = 90, 10-14 years) and
   their families (dyads) in Uganda. Nine clinics will be randomized to one
   of three study arms (n = 3 clinics, 30 child-caregiver dyads each): (1)
   usual care; (2) G-CBT + usual care; and (3) MFG + usual care. Both
   treatment and control conditions will be delivered over a 3-month
   period. Data will be collected at baseline (pre-intervention) and at 3
   months and 6 months post-intervention initiation.
   Conclusion: The primary aim of the proposed project is to address the
   urgent need for theoretically and empirically informed interventions
   that seek to reduce HIV-associated stigma and its negative impact on
   adolescent health and psychosocial well-being. As several countries in
   SSA grapple with care and support for CLWH, this study will lay the
   foundation for a larger intervention study investigating how
   HIV-associated stigma can be reduced to foster healthy child
   development-especially for CLWH as they transition through adolescence.},

Title = {Revisiting concepts of evidence in implementation science},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {Background Evidence, in multiple forms, is a foundation of
   implementation science. For public health and clinical practice,
   evidence includes the following: type 1 evidence on etiology and burden;
   type 2 evidence on effectiveness of interventions; and type 3: evidence
   on dissemination and implementation (D\&I) within context. To support a
   vision for development and use of evidence in D\&I science that is more
   comprehensive and equitable (particularly for type 3 evidence), this
   article aims to clarify concepts of evidence, summarize ongoing debates
   about evidence, and provide a set of recommendations and tools/resources
   for addressing the ``how-to{''} in filling evidence gaps most critical
   to advancing implementation science. Main text Because current
   conceptualizations of evidence have been relatively narrow and
   insufficiently characterized in our opinion, we identify and discuss
   challenges and debates about the uses, usefulness, and gaps in evidence
   for implementation science. A set of questions is proposed to assist in
   determining when evidence is sufficient for dissemination and
   implementation. Intersecting gaps include the need to (1) reconsider how
   the evidence base is determined, (2) improve understanding of contextual
   effects on implementation, (3) sharpen the focus on health equity in how
   we approach and build the evidence-base, (4) conduct more policy
   implementation research and evaluation, and (5) learn from audience and
   stakeholder perspectives. We offer 15 recommendations to assist in
   filling these gaps and describe a set of tools for enhancing the
   evidence most needed in implementation science. Conclusions To address
   our recommendations, we see capacity as a necessary ingredient to shift
   the field's approach to evidence. Capacity includes the ``push{''} for
   implementation science where researchers are trained to develop and
   evaluate evidence which should be useful and feasible for implementers
   and reflect community or stakeholder priorities. Equally important,
   there has been inadequate training and too little emphasis on the
   ``pull{''} for implementation science (e.g., training implementers,
   practice-based research). We suggest that funders and reviewers of
   research should adopt and support a more robust definition of evidence.
   By critically examining the evolving nature of evidence, implementation
   science can better fulfill its vision of facilitating widespread and
   equitable adoption, delivery, and sustainment of scientific advances.},

Abstract = {Background Bedtime routines are highly recurrent family activities with
   implications for children's wellbeing, development and health. Aims The
   objective of this study is to co-develop and test in a feasibility,
   proof-of-concept study a bedtime routines intervention using text
   messages aimed at first-time parents with young children. Methods Fifty
   first-time parents with children aged 1-3 years were recruited for this
   study. Parents received a text message-based intervention for
   7-consecutive nights which provided support and information on achieving
   optimal bedtime routines. Parents completed pre- and post-intervention
   questionnaires focusing on children's sleep, bedtime routines and
   parental mood disturbance. Feedback was provided at the end of the
   study. Results Recruitment target and high retention with 98\%, or 49
   out of 50 participants completing the study were achieved. Pre- and
   post-intervention, there were improvements in total children's sleep
   with children sleeping longer and having less disrupted sleep overall
   (MD = - 7.77 (SD = 17.91), t(48) = - 3.03, p = .004, CI (- 12.91, -
   2.63) and in overall quality of bedtime routines (MD = - 5.00, SD =
   7.01, t(48) = - 4.98, p < .001, CI (- 7.01, - 2.98). Parental mood
   disturbance decreased pre- to post-intervention (MD = 5.87, SD = 15.43,
   t(48) = 2.66), p = .010, CI (1.44, 10.30). Parents provided positive
   feedback about the intervention and valued the support that was provided
   to them. Conclusions Bedtime routines were successfully altered with
   short-term benefits for children's sleep and parental mood. Future
   research will need to utilize a more robust, longitudinal approach for a
   definite exploration of sustained changes in bedtime routines and their
   long-term implications for children and parents.},

Title = {Development and feasibility testing of a physical activity intervention
   for youth with anxiety and depression: a study protocol},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders in children and adolescents
   are highly prevalent and account for more than half of all youth
   psychiatric disorders. Left untreated, anxiety, and depression lead to
   numerous detrimental outcomes, including reduced quality of life,
   psychiatric, and somatic comorbidity and even reduced lifespan. This
   puts a large strain on child and adolescent mental healthcare services
   (CAMHS) to provide effective treatments. However, even when provided the
   best evidence-based treatment, between 40-50\% of patients continue to
   report significant symptom burdens. Thus, there is an immediate need for
   supplemental and/or new treatment approaches. Physical activity as a
   supplementary treatment may be such an approach. However, research
   investigating this approach within this population is scant. This
   protocol paper describes the development and feasibility trial of a
   physical activity-based intervention targeting anxiety and depressive
   symptoms in youth treated in CAMHS.
   Methods/design: The study is based on the UK Medical Council Research
   Framework (MRC) for developing and evaluating complex interventions.
   Feasibility and acceptability of the physical activity intervention
   (confident, active, and happy youth) will be evaluated in an
   uncontrolled open-label trial using qualitative and quantitative data.
   Twenty youths with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be recruited.
   Acceptability of assessment procedures, the intervention, and perceived
   benefits and barriers to participation will be assessed, and qualitative
   interviews with participants, caregivers, and referring specialists will
   explore contextual and practical factors associated with intervention
   delivery. Physical activity will be measured using the Actigraph GT3X+
   monitor at baseline, and post-intervention and change in anxiety and
   depression will be assessed.
   Discussion: This study will contribute to the development of
   supplementary physical treatment interventions for youth with anxiety
   and depression in contact with CAMHS. The goal is to examine new avenues
   of treatment that ultimately may improve upon current treatment outcomes
   of anxiety and depression. This work will be in preparation for a future
   definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) of this approach, in line
   with the MRC Framework.},

Title = {Translational framework for implementation evaluation and research: a

   instrument development},

Abstract = {Background: Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) is frequently used to
   inform qualitative research that aims to explain and evaluate processes
   that shape late-stage translation of innovations in the organisation and
   delivery of healthcare. A coding manual for qualitative researchers
   using NPT will facilitate transparent data analysis processes and will
   also reduce the cognitive and practical burden on researchers.
   Objectives: (a) To simplify the theory for the user. (b) To describe the
   purposes, methods of development, and potential application of a coding
   manual that translates normalisation process theory (NPT) into an easily
   usable framework for qualitative analysis. (c) To present an NPT coding
   manual that is ready for use.
   Method: Qualitative content analysis of papers and chapters that
   developed normalisation process theory, selection and structuring of
   theory constructs, and testing constructs against interview data and
   published empirical studies using NPT.
   Results: A coding manual for NPT was developed. It consists of 12
   primary NPT constructs and conforms to the Context-Mechanism-Outcome
   configuration of realist evaluation studies. Contexts are defined as
   settings in which implementation work is done, in which strategic
   intentions, adaptive execution, negotiating capability, and reframing
   organisational logics are enacted. Mechanisms are defined as the work
   that people do when they participate in implementation processes and
   include coherence-building, cognitive participation, collective action,
   and reflexive monitoring. Outcomes are defined as effects that make
   visible how things change as implementation processes proceed and
   include intervention mobilisation, normative restructuring, relational
   restructuring, and sustainment.
   Conclusion: The coding manual is ready to use and performs three
   important tasks. It consolidates several iterations of theory
   development, makes the application of NPT simpler for the user, and
   links NPT constructs to realist evaluation methods. The coding manual
   forms the core of a translational framework for implementation research
   and evaluation.},

Title = {`Making the most of together time': development of a Health Visitor-led
   intervention to support children's early language and communication
   development at the 2-21/2-year-old review},

Abstract = {Background Early interventions to support young children's language
   development through responsive parent-child interaction have proven
   efficacy but are not currently delivered universally. A potential
   universal delivery platform is the Health Visitor (HV)-led
   2-21/2-year-old review in England's Healthy Child Programme. It is
   unclear if it is feasible to offer such interventions through this
   platform. We report an intervention development process, including
   extensive stakeholder consultation and co-design which aimed to develop
   an acceptable, feasible and equitable early language intervention for
   delivery in this context. Methods The study involved five phases
   including 13 stakeholder co-design workshops with 7 parents and 39
   practitioners (HVs, early years practitioners and speech and language
   therapists): (1) Identification of existing intervention evidence, (2)
   qualitative review of intervention studies extracting candidate target
   behaviours for intervention and intervention techniques, (3) co-design
   workshops with parents and practitioners examining acceptability,
   barriers and enablers to those behaviours and techniques (particular
   attention was paid to diverse family circumstances and the range of
   barriers which might exist), (4) findings were analysed using COM-B and
   theoretical domains frameworks and a prototype intervention model
   designed, and (5) co-design workshops iteratively refined the proposed
   model. Results Practitioners were committed to offering language
   intervention at the 2-21/2-year-old review but were not sure precisely
   how to do so. Parents/caregivers wanted to be proactive and to have
   agency in supporting their own children and to do this as soon as
   possible. For equitable intervention, it must be proportionate, with
   higher `intensity' for higher levels of disadvantage, and tailored,
   offering differing approaches considering the specific barriers and
   enablers, assets and challenges in each family. The importance and
   potential fragility of alliances between parent/caregiver and
   practitioner were identified as key, and so, strategies to engender
   successful collaborative partnership are also embedded in intervention
   design. Conclusion It is possible to develop a universal intervention
   which parents and practitioners judge would be acceptable, feasible and
   equitable for use at the 2-21/2-year review to promote children's
   language development. The result is one of the most explicitly developed

Title = {`Playlist for Life' at the end of life: a mixed-methods feasibility
   study of a personalised music listening intervention in the hospice
   setting},

Abstract = {Background Playlist for Life is a brief, inexpensive music listening
   intervention which originated in dementia care, but is increasingly
   being used for people at the end of life. However, there is a lack of
   robust empirical research on its application in the hospice setting. Our
   patient and public involvement group originated the idea for this study.
   The aim of this feasibility study was to inform the design of a larger
   effectiveness study on the use of Playlist for Life in the hospice
   setting. Method This study was a mixed-methods feasibility study
   involving adults at the end of life, family members and hospice staff
   from one in-patient hospice in Scotland. Eligible patient/family member
   dyads were approached by hospice staff and if interested, recruited by
   the researcher. All included participants received the intervention,
   which involved the provision of an MP3 player and assistance to set up a
   playlist. Participants were asked to listen to the playlist daily during
   the intervention period (7 days). Data were collected through patient
   reported outcome measures and on days 1, 3 and 7 of the intervention
   period and through participant observation session. Patient/family
   member dyads and hospice staff also took part in qualitative interviews
   (Appendix 1) post-intervention, which were audio-recorded, transcribed
   and analysed thematically. Semi-structured interviews at the end of the
   intervention period were used to evaluate feasibility and acceptability.
   An advisory group including patients, family members and staff gave
   helpful feedback on the qualitative interview questions. Interview
   questions were the same for all participants and all the questions were
   asked to all participants. Results N = 15 participants were recruited (n
   = 5 patients, n = 5 family, n = 5 staff. The intervention was appraised
   positively, particularly regarding its beneficial effect on
   patient/family relationships. The study design was deemed feasible and
   acceptable. Conclusion The findings of this study will inform the
   development of a future randomised cluster trial designed to assess the
   usability and effectiveness of the Playlist for Life personalised music
   intervention.},

Abstract = {Background Pilot/feasibility studies play an important role in the
   development and refinement of behavioral interventions by providing
   information about feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy.
   Despite their importance and wide-spread use, the approaches taken by
   behavioral scientists to scale-up early-stage studies to larger-scale
   trials has received little attention. The aim of our study was to
   understand the role that pilot studies play in the development and
   execution of larger-scale trials. Methods We conducted interviews with
   childhood obesity researchers who had published pilot behavioral
   interventions and larger-scale trials of the same or similar
   interventions. Questions were asked about the role of pilot studies in
   developing larger-scale trials and the challenges encountered when
   scaling-up an intervention based upon pilot findings. Data were coded
   and analyzed using an inductive analytic approach to identify themes.
   Results Twenty-four interventionists (54\% women, 37-70 years old, mean
   20 years since terminal degree) completed a total of 148 pilot studies
   across their careers (mean 6.4, range 1-20), of which 59\% were
   scaled-up. Scaling was described as resource intensive and pilot work
   was considered essential to successfully competing for funding by 63\%
   of the sample (n = 15). When asked to define a high-quality pilot study,
   interventionists described studies that allowed them to evaluate two
   independent factors: components of their intervention (e.g.,
   acceptability, feasibility) and study parameters (e.g., sample size,
   measures). Interventionists expressed that more process implementation
   measures, different study designs, and additional iterations could
   improve decisions to scale-up. Most agreed that pilot studies were
   likely to produce inflated estimates of potential efficacy though only
   nine interventionists provided potential solutions for decreasing
   inflated measures of efficacy. Suggested major causes of inflated
   effects included high levels of oversight in pilot studies (e.g.,
   researcher support), reliance on subjective measures, and utilizing
   convenience or highly motivated samples. Potential solutions included
   designing pilots for real-world implementation, only conducting
   randomized controlled pilot studies, and pre-registering pilot studies.
   Conclusions Pilot studies purposes are multifaceted and deemed essential
   to obtaining funding for larger-scale trials. Clarifying the form and
   function of preliminary, early-stage research may enhance the productive
   utilization of early-stage studies and reduced drops in efficacy when
   transitioning to larger scale studies.},

Title = {The feasibility and acceptability of a brief psychological intervention

Abstract = {Background: Adults with long-term health conditions (LTCs) are more
   likely to experience depressive symptoms which can worsen health
   outcomes and quality of life, and increase healthcare costs.
   Subthreshold depression may go undetected and/or untreated.
   The Community Pharmacies Mood Intervention Study (CHEMIST) explored
   whether community pharmacies represent a suitable setting to offer brief
   psychological support to people with LTCs and comorbid subthreshold
   depression.
   Methods: A feasibility intervention study with a nested mixed methods
   evaluation was employed. Adults with subthreshold depression and a
   minimum of one LTC were recruited from community pharmacies/local
   general practices and offered a brief psychological support intervention
   ('Enhanced Support Intervention' (ESI)), based on behavioural activation
   within a Collaborative Care framework. The intervention included up to
   six sessions supported by pharmacy staff ('ESI facilitators') trained to
   deliver the ESI within the community pharmacy setting.
   Recruitment, retention rates and engagement with the ESI were assessed.
   Semi-structured, one-to-one interviews with pharmacy staff and study
   participants, and a focus group with pharmacy staff, explored
   experiences and acceptability of the study and the ESI. Themes were
   mapped onto constructs of the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability.
   Results: Recruitment of ESI participants was challenging and slower than
   anticipated despite the varied methods of recruitment employed;
   although, this was useful in identifying barriers and enabling factors
   for participation. Engagament with the ESI was good with n=17 (71\%)
   recruited participants commencing the ESI. The ESI was found to be
   acceptable to participants and ESI facilitators. Retention rate at 4
   months was good n=20 (87.0\%).
   Conclusions: Community pharmacies were viewed as an acceptable setting
   in which to deliver preventative brief psychological support to people
   with LTCs at risk of depression.
   This feasibility study provided important data to inform the design of a
   pilot randomised controlled trial in this setting and highlighted
   important considerations for future pharmacy-based research.},

   (EBIs) are widely recognized among practitioners and researchers.
   Context, broadly defined as everything outside the EBI, includes the
   dynamic and diverse array of forces working for or against
   implementation efforts. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation
   Research (CFIR) is one of the most widely used frameworks to guide
   assessment of contextual determinants of implementation. The original
   2009 article invited critique in recognition for the need for the
   framework to evolve. As implementation science has matured, gaps in the
   CFIR have been identified and updates are needed. Our team is developing
   the CFIR 2.0 based on a literature review and follow-up survey with
   authors. We propose an Outcomes Addendum to the CFIR to address
   recommendations from these sources to include outcomes in the framework.
   Main text We conducted a literature review and surveyed corresponding
   authors of included articles to identify recommendations for the CFIR.
   There were recommendations to add both implementation and innovation
   outcomes from these sources. Based on these recommendations, we make
   conceptual distinctions between (1) anticipated implementation outcomes
   and actual implementation outcomes, (2) implementation outcomes and
   innovation outcomes, and (3) CFIR-based implementation determinants and
   innovation determinants. Conclusion An Outcomes Addendum to the CFIR is
   proposed. Our goal is to offer clear conceptual distinctions between
   types of outcomes for use with the CFIR, and perhaps other determinant
   implementation frameworks as well. These distinctions can help bring
   clarity as researchers consider which outcomes are most appropriate to
   evaluate in their research. We hope that sharing this in advance will
   generate feedback and debate about the merits of our proposed addendum.},

Abstract = {Background: Many individuals with intellectual disability (ID) have not
   learnt basic reading skills by the time that they reach adulthood,
   potentially limiting their access to critical information. READ-IT is an
   online reading programme developed from the Headsprout (R) Early Reading
   (HER (R)) intervention and supplemented by support strategies tailored
   for adults with ID. HER (R) has been successfully used to teach adults
   with ID to read in a forensic setting by trained staff. The aim of this
   study is to assess the feasibility of delivering READ-IT to adults with
   ID by family carers/support workers and will assess whether it would be
   feasible to conduct a later definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT)
   of the effectiveness of the programme. The study will aim to contribute
   to the evidence base on improving outcomes for adults with ID and their
   caregivers.
   Methods: This study is a feasibility RCT, with embedded process
   evaluation. Forty-eight adults with ID will be recruited and allocated
   to intervention: control on a 1:1 basis. Intervention families will be
   offered the READ-IT programme immediately, continuing to receive usual
   practice and control participants will be offered the opportunity to
   receive READ-IT at the end of the trial follow-up period and will
   continue to receive usual practice. Data will be collected at baseline
   and 6 months post-randomisation.
   Discussion: The results of this study will inform a potential future
   definitive trial, to evaluate the effectiveness of READ-IT to improve
   reading skills. Such a trial would have significant scientific impact
   internationally in the intellectual disability field.},

Abstract = {Background Dance is a mind-body activity of purposeful rhythmic movement
   to music. There is growing interest in using dance as a form of
   cognitive and physical rehabilitation. This manuscript describes the
   development of GERAS DANcing for Cognition and Exercise (DANCE) and
   evaluates its feasibility in older adults with cognitive and mobility
   impairments. Methods The progressive dance curricula were delivered for
   15 weeks (1-h class; twice weekly). Participants were eligible if they
   were community-dwelling older adults aged 60+ with early cognitive or
   mobility impairment able to follow three-step commands and move
   independently. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment/retention,
   adherence, participant satisfaction, safety, and adverse events. Results
   Twenty-five older adults (mean (standard deviation {[}SD]) age = 77.55
   (6.10) years, range 68-90 years) with early cognitive (Montreal
   Cognitive Assessment score (SD) = 21.77 (4.05)) and mobility (92\% were
   pre-frail/frail as indicated on the Fried Frailty Phenotype) impairments
   were recruited from a geriatric out-patient clinic or within the
   community. A total of 20/25 (80\%) participants completed the study.
   Average class attendance was 72\%, and self-reported homework adherence
   ``most-days / every day{''} was 89\%. A stepwise progression in the
   dance curricula was observed with increases in motor complexity and
   balance demands, and 95\% of participants rated the program as a
   ``just-right{''} challenge. Ninety percent of participants rated GERAS
   DANCE as excellent, and 100\% would recommend the program to a friend or
   family member. Over 50\% of participants connected outside of class time
   for a self-initiated coffee club. Adverse events of falls and fractures
   were reported for 2 participants, which occurred at home unrelated to
   the dance intervention during the study period. Pre-determined
   thresholds for feasibility were met for all outcomes. Discussion GERAS
   DANCE is a feasible and enjoyable program for older adults with early
   cognitive or mobility impairments. GERAS DANCE curriculum grading
   (duration; sequence; instructions) and motor complexity increases in
   agility, balance, and coordination appear appropriately tailored for
   this population. Future work will explore the feasibility of GERAS DANCE
   in new settings (i.e., virtually online, community centers, or
   retirement homes) and the mind-body-social benefits of dance.},

Title = {CHoosing Active Role Models to INspire Girls (CHARMING): protocol for a
   cluster randomised feasibility trial of a school-based, community-linked
   programme to increase physical activity levels in 9-10-year-old girls},

Abstract = {Background: In the UK, there is evidence that girls' physical activity
   tends to decline to a greater extent than boys as they enter
   adolescence. `Role models' could play a vital role in inspiring girls to
   become or remain physically active. The CHARMING Programme is a primary
   school-based community linked role-model programme, co-developed in
   2016, with children, parents, schools and wider stakeholders. It
   involves different types of physical activity delivered for 1-h each
   week by a community provider and peer role models (e.g. older girls from
   secondary schools) joining in with the sessions. The programme
   ultimately aims to increase and sustain physical activity levels among
   9-10-year-old girls. This study aims to assess the feasibility and
   acceptability of the CHARMING Programme and of evaluating it using a
   randomised trial.
   Methods: This study is a feasibility cluster randomised controlled
   trial, with embedded process evaluation and health economic evaluation.
   Approximately 90 Year 5 (i.e. 9-10-year-old) girls will be recruited
   across six primary schools in Mid-South Wales. Participating schools
   will be allocated to the programme: control on a 2:1 basis; four
   intervention schools will run the CHARMING Programme and two will
   continue with usual practice. A survey and accelerometer will be
   administered at baseline and repeated at 12 months. Interviews and focus
   groups will be conducted post-intervention delivery. The primary aim is
   to assess feasibility of a future randomised trial via the recruitment
   of schools, participants and role models; randomisation; retention;
   reach; data collection completion rates; programme adherence; and
   programme fidelity, views on intervention acceptability and programme
   barriers and facilitators. Secondary aims are to evaluate established
   physical activity outcome measures for children plus additional health
   economic outcomes for inclusion in a future full-scale trial.
   Discussion: The results of this study will inform decisions on whether
   and how to proceed to a full-scale evaluation of the effectiveness and
   cost-effectiveness of the CHARMING Programme to improve or sustain
   physical activity.},

Title = {Changing the preschool setting to promote healthy energy balance-related
   behaviours of preschoolers: a qualitative and quantitative process
   evaluation of the SuperFIT approach},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Volume = {16},

Month = {DEC 4},
Abstract = {Background The Early Care and Education (ECE) setting plays an important
   role in the promotion of a healthy lifestyle in young children. SuperFIT
   is a comprehensive, integrated intervention approach designed to promote
   healthy energy balance-related behaviours in preschoolers. Insight in
   the process of implementation and the context in which SuperFIT was
   implemented supports the understanding of how the intervention works in
   practice. This process evaluation examined factors that influenced the
   implementation and maintenance, as well as the (perceived) changes in
   the ECE setting.
   Methods A mixed-methods study was conducted. SuperFIT was implemented at
   twelve preschools in the south of the Netherlands. The process
   evaluation was performed among preschool teachers, managers of the
   preschool organisation, and implementers. Semi-structured in-depth
   (group) interviews, quantitative process questionnaires, the Child-care
   Food and Activity Practices Questionnaire (CFAPQ) and the Environmental
   and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) were used to evaluate the
   implementation and maintenance of SuperFIT and the changes in the
   preschool setting. The interviews were analysed using a theoretical
   framework based on the Implementation Framework of Fleuren and
   Damschroder's Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.
   Descriptive analyses were performed on the quantitative data. Results
   Various intervention activities were implemented in the preschool
   setting. Although the intention to maintain SuperFIT was present, this
   was hindered by time constraints and lack of financial resources.
   Important factors that influenced implementation and maintenance were
   incongruence with current practice, limited perceived capabilities to
   integrate SuperFIT in daily practice, group composition at the
   preschools, and the perceived top-down implementation. Organizational
   vision and societal attention regarding healthy behaviour in general
   were perceived to be supportive for implementation and maintenance.
   Predominantly, favourable changes were seen in the nutrition- and
   physical activity-related practices of preschool teachers and other
   aspects of the social preschool environment such as the use of play
   materials. Limited changes were observed in the physical preschool
   environment.
   Conclusions Several factors influenced the implementation and
   maintenance of SuperFIT in the preschool setting. Some factors evolved
   over time from hindering to facilitating, emphasising the importance of
   allowing sufficient time for intervention implementation. SuperFIT
   changed mainly the social preschool environment.},

Title = {HeartPhone: Mobile Evaluative Conditioning to Enhance Affective
   Processes and Promote Physical Activity},

Abstract = {Objective: Most American adults fail to achieve recommended levels of
   physical activity and, as a result, are at elevated risk for many
   chronic diseases. Affective processes have been validated as targets for
   increasing physical activity but are rarely targeted directly by
   behavioral interventions. This article describes 2 early phase studies
   used to develop HeartPhone, a smartphone application for conditioning
   associations between physical activity and pleasure. HeartPhone exposes
   users to brief doses of evaluative conditioning stimuli via background
   images on a smartphone lock screen. Method: Study 1 evaluated the
   feasibility of delivering mobile evaluative conditioning and estimated
   doses received over 7-21 days in a small sample of users (n = 6). Study
   2 used a single-group prepost design to evaluate user experience and
   determine whether any change in reflective motivation or physical
   activity was possible over 8 weeks of HeartPhone use (n = 19). Results:
   In Study 1, users accumulated almost 2 min/day of exposure to
   conditioning stimuli, indicating the feasibility of delivering
   microdoses of evaluative conditioning via smartphone lock screens. In
   Study 2, adults reported accepting the application and conditioning
   stimuli, improved affective judgments of physical activity (enjoyment,
   intrinsic motivation, integrated regulations), and increased physical
   activity. Conclusions: These results provide proof-of-concept for a
   low-friction approach for enhancing affective processing and increasing
   physical activity. Based on early phase success as a tool for engaging
   smartphone users in behavior change, the HeartPhone intervention is
   ready for a Phase IIb pilot and III efficacy trials.},

Abstract = {Developing and testing more effective health-related behavioral
   interventions is critical to making progress in improving disease
   prevention and treatment. One way to achieve this goal is to use a
   systematic and progressive framework that outlines the steps needed to
   translate theories, findings, and basic understandings about human
   behavior into risk factor and disease management or mitigation
   strategies. Although several frameworks and process models have been
   designed to inform the development and optimization of health-related
   behavioral interventions, little guidance is available to compare key
   aspects of these models, clarify their common and unique features, and
   aid in selecting the best approach for a specific research question.
   This article describes the major frameworks that focus on early phase
   translation-that is, approaches that address the design and optimization
   of behavioral interventions before testing in Phase III efficacy trials.
   Differences between and common features of these models are described,
   opportunities for combining frameworks to maximize their impact are
   noted, and guidance is provided to enable investigators to choose the
   most useful model(s) when designing and optimizing health-related
   behavioral interventions. The goal of this article is to promote the
   consistent use of frameworks that encourage a systematic, progressive
   approach to behavioral intervention development and testing as one way
   to encourage the creation of well-characterized, optimized, and
   potentially more effective health-related behavioral interventions.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Laboratory studies have contributed important information
   about the determinants of food and alcohol intake, and they have
   prompted the development of behavior change interventions that have been
   evaluated in randomized controlled trials conducted in the field. In
   this article we apply a recent experimental medicine (EM) framework to
   this body of research. Method: A conceptual review and focused
   discussion of the relevant literature is presented. Results: We
   illustrate how it is possible to translate findings from studies of food
   and alcohol intake in the laboratory into interventions that are
   effective for changing behavior in the real world. We go on to
   demonstrate how systematic failures can occur at different stages within
   the EM framework, and how these failures ultimately result in
   interventions that are ineffective for changing behavior. We also
   consider methodological issues that may constrain the external validity
   of findings from laboratory studies including demand effects,
   participant characteristics, and the timing and dose of behavioral
   interventions. Throughout, we make recommendations to improve the
   translation of findings from laboratory studies into behavior change
   interventions that are effective in the field. Conclusions:
   Consideration of the EM framework will help to ensure that promising
   candidate interventions for eating and drinking that are identified in
   laboratory studies can fulfill their translational promise.},

Abstract = {The use of systematic dose-finding designs to develop behavioral health
   interventions is lacking. In contrast, drug development research
   consistently follows a prescribed, regulated, and iterative pathway that
   begins with empirically establishing optimal drug dose. Adapting
   dose-finding methodologies from the drug development literature offers
   several advantages to increasing the feasibility, efficiency, and rigor
   of this important intervention refining step for behavioral intervention
   development. This article discusses the current state of the science for
   dose finding within the behavioral intervention development literature.
   A detailed overview of one drug development dose-finding methodology
   (the Accelerated Biased Coin Up-and-Down design) is then presented,
   using our work to adapt the Prevention Plus Intervention for treatment
   of pediatric obesity for mHealth delivery as an example of how this
   design can be applied to empirically derive the dose for a behavioral
   intervention.},

Title = {Potential efficacy of parent-infant psychotherapy with mothers and their
   infants from a high-risk population: a randomized controlled pilot trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background: Psychotherapy of mother-child dyads is an intervention which
   was developed to prevent maltreatment and negative children's
   development. There is a lack of good-quality research investigating
   psychotherapeutic interventions and social care for mothers at high-risk
   living in Mother-Child Facilities in Germany. The present randomized
   controlled pilot trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate the need for
   parent-infant psychotherapy (PIP) and to explore its impact on the
   mother-infant relationship. Primary feasibility objectives were
   recruitment and attrition, with potential efficacy defined as the
   secondary feasibility objective.
   Methods: This pilot RCT focused on (young) mothers with cumulative risk
   factors and their infants under 7 months of age living in Mother-Child
   Facilities. N=32 mother-child dyads were randomly allocated to PIP or
   Care as usual (CAU). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6
   months of intervention. The primary potential efficacy outcome was
   maternal sensitivity. Secondary outcomes were maternal mental health
   problems, reflective functioning, parenting stress, personality
   organization, infant's development, and attachment.
   Results: At baseline, all mothers showed low levels of emotional
   availability, but results revealed improvements in sensitivity, mental
   health problems, stress, and depressive symptomatology favoring PIP
   after 6 months. Positive developments in maternal sensitivity, a healthy
   aspect of mother-child interaction, were only found in the PIP group.
   Overall attrition was high at 6 months. Some evidence of fewer
   depressive symptoms and lower maternal distress after 6 months of
   PIP-intervention exists that did not reach significance.
   Conclusion: Findings revealed improvements in the mother's well-being
   for both groups, but PIP had a higher impact on the mother-child dyad.
   In sum, there is some evidence that PIP may represent an effective
   intervention offer besides the social and pedagogical support in these
   facilities, but further research is demanded.},

Title = {A study protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility trial of an
   intervention to increase activity and reduce sedentary behaviour in
   people with severe mental illness: Walking fOR Health (WORtH) Study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Background: People with severe mental illness (SMI) are less physically
   active and more sedentary than healthy controls, contributing to poorer
   physical health outcomes in this population. There is a need to
   understand the feasibility and acceptability, and explore the effective
   components, of health behaviour change interventions targeting physical
   activity and sedentary behaviour in this population in rural and
   semi-rural settings.
   Methods: This 13-week randomised controlled feasibility trial compares
   the Walking fOR Health (WORtH) multi-component behaviour change
   intervention, which includes education, goal-setting and
   self-monitoring, with a one-off education session. It aims to recruit 60
   inactive adults with SMI via three community mental health teams in
   Ireland and Northern Ireland. Primary outcomes are related to
   feasibility and acceptability, including recruitment, retention and
   adherence rates, adverse events and qualitative feedback from
   participants and clinicians. Secondary outcome measures include
   self-reported and accelerometer-measured physical activity and sedentary
   behaviour, anthropometry measures, physical function and mental
   wellbeing. A mixed-methods process evaluation will be undertaken. This
   study protocol outlines changes to the study in response to the COVID-19
   pandemic.
   Discussion: This study will address the challenges and implications of
   remote delivery of the WORtH intervention due to the COVID-19 pandemic
   and inform the design of a future definitive randomised controlled trial
   if it is shown to be feasible.},

Abstract = {Background We aimed to establish what core elements were required in a
   group therapy programme for men who disclose perpetrating intimate
   partner abuse in a substance use setting and develop, and test the
   feasibility of delivering an intervention in this setting. Methods We
   describe the theoretical development and feasibility testing of an
   integrated substance use and intimate partner abuse intervention
   ('ADVANCE') for delivery in substance use services. We employed a
   comprehensive eight-stage process to guide this development applying the
   `COM-B' ('capability', `opportunity', `motivation' and `behaviour')
   model for intervention design which specifies the following: (1) define
   the problem, (2) select the target behaviour, (3) specify the target
   behaviour, (4) identify what needs to change, (5) identify intervention
   functions, (6) identify policy categories, (7) select behaviour change
   techniques, and (8) design a mode of delivery. The development was
   informed by primary research conducted by the authors, consulting with
   organisation steering groups and by those with personal experiences. The
   identified targets for intervention and mode and method of delivery were
   then refined over 4 intervention development meetings, using the nominal
   group technique with the ADVANCE experts, then further refined following
   consultation with service user groups and wider expert groups via a
   learning alliance meetings. Results Our final intervention, the ADVANCE
   intervention consisted of a group intervention comprising of up to four
   pre-group individual interviews, followed by 12 x 2-h group sessions
   supported by integrated safety work for victim/survivors, and risk and
   safety support and integrity support for the professionals. The main
   targets for change were personal goal planning, self-regulation, and
   attitudes and beliefs supporting intimate partner abuse. The
   intervention was regarded as very acceptable to both staff and clients
   in substance use services, with group attendees reported positive
   behaviour changes and development of new skills. Conclusion We have
   demonstrated the ability to employ a structured eight-step process to
   develop an integrated intervention to address substance use-related
   intimate partner abuse that is acceptable to staff and clients in
   substance use services. This led to a feasibility study (ISRCTN
   79435190) involving 104 men and 30 staff at three different locations
   across the UK was conducted to assess the feasibility and acceptability
   of the intervention and to refine the content and approach to delivery

   for pilot evaluation},

Abstract = {Background: Emerging adults with early psychosis demonstrate high rates
   of service disengagement from critical early intervention services.
   Decision support interventions and peer support have both been shown to
   enhance service engagement but are understudied in this population. The
   purposes of this article are to describe the development of a novel
   peer-delivered decision coaching intervention for this population and to
   report plans for a pilot study designed to gather preliminary data about
   its feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact.
   Methods: The intervention was developed based on formative qualitative
   data and in collaboration with a diverse team of researchers, key
   stakeholders, and expert consultants. The pilot trial will utilize a
   single-group (N = 20), prepost, convergent mixed-methods design to
   explore whether and how the intervention addresses decision-making needs
   (the primary intervention target). The impact of the intervention on
   secondary outcomes (e.g., engagement in the program) will also be
   assessed. Additionally, through observation and feedback from the peer
   decision coach and study participants, we will evaluate the feasibility
   of research and intervention procedures, and the acceptability of
   information and support from the peer decision coach.
   Discussion: The peer-delivered decision coaching intervention holds
   promise for assisting young people with making informed and
   values-consistent decisions about their care, and potentially enhancing
   service engagement within this traditionally difficult-to-engage
   population. If the intervention demonstrates feasibility and
   acceptability, and pilot data show its potential for improving treatment
   decision-making, our work will also lay the foundation for a new
   evidence base regarding roles for peer specialists on early intervention
   teams.},

Title = {Strategies for Empowering activities in Everyday life (SEE 1.0): study
   protocol for a feasibility study of an Internet-based occupational
   therapy intervention for people with stroke},

Abstract = {Background: Rehabilitation after stroke seldom focuses on needs related
   to an active everyday life and the process of change that people must
   undergo to adapt to an altered capacity and life situation. In
   particular, occupational therapy in the late phase needs to support
   clients in adopting sustainable self-initiated management strategies to
   regain daily activities and an active everyday life. To improve access
   to rehabilitation, the use of digital solutions has been suggested. This
   study aims to evaluate the feasibility of the Internet-based
   occupational therapy intervention ``Strategies for Empowering activities
   in Everyday life{''} (SEE, version 1.0). We will investigate the
   feasibility of the intervention process in terms of acceptability and
   adherence as well as the most suitable outcome measures to evaluate SEE
   and improve the knowledge about the potential changes and outcomes of
   SEE for clients with stroke.
   Methods: This feasibility study is based on a pretest posttest design
   without a control group. Quantitative and qualitative data will be
   collected from clients and staff concurrently embedded in a mixed-method
   design during the entire study.
   Discussion: The project is a first test of a novel Internet-based
   occupational therapy intervention, and the research will contribute to
   the continued development and evaluation of the SEE programme. SEE can
   provide people with strategies in daily activities that can support them
   to live an active everyday life despite changed capacity and to improve
   access to rehabilitation interventions.},

Title = {Small studies, big decisions: the role of pilot/feasibility studies in
   incremental science and premature scale-up of behavioral interventions},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Background: Careful consideration and planning are required to establish
   ``sufficient{''} evidence to ensure an investment in a larger, more
   well-powered behavioral intervention trial is worthwhile. In the
   behavioral sciences, this process typically occurs where smaller-scale
   studies inform larger-scale trials. Believing that one can do the same
   things and expect the same outcomes in a larger-scale trial that were
   done in a smaller-scale preliminary study (i.e., pilot/feasibility) is
   wishful thinking, yet common practice. Starting small makes sense, but
   small studies come with big decisions that can influence the usefulness
   of the evidence designed to inform decisions about moving forward with a
   larger-scale trial. The purpose of this commentary is to discuss what
   may constitute sufficient evidence for moving forward to a definitive
   trial. The discussion focuses on challenges often encountered when
   conducting pilot/feasibility studies, referred to as common (mis)steps,
   that can lead to inflated estimates of both feasibility and efficacy,
   and how the intentional design and execution of one or more, often
   small, pilot/feasibility studies can play a central role in developing
   an intervention that scales beyond a highly localized context.
   Main body: Establishing sufficient evidence to support larger-scale,
   definitive trials, from smaller studies, is complicated. For any given
   behavioral intervention, the type and amount of evidence necessary to be
   deemed sufficient is inherently variable and can range anywhere from
   qualitative interviews of individuals representative of the target
   population to a small-scale randomized trial that mimics the anticipated
   larger-scale trial. Major challenges and common (mis)steps in the
   execution of pilot/feasibility studies discussed are those focused on
   selecting the right sample size, issues with scaling, adaptations and
   their influence on the preliminary feasibility and efficacy estimates
   observed, as well as the growing pains of progressing from small to
   large samples. Finally, funding and resource constraints for conducting
   informative pilot/feasibility study(ies) are discussed.
   Conclusion: Sufficient evidence to scale will always remain in the eye
   of the beholder. An understanding of how to design informative small
   pilot/feasibility studies can assist in speeding up incremental science
   (where everything needs to be piloted) while slowing down premature
   scale-up (where any evidence is sufficient for scaling).},

Title = {Planning and optimising a digital intervention to protect older adults'

Abstract = {Background By 2050, worldwide dementia prevalence is expected to triple.
   Affordable, scalable interventions are required to support protective
   behaviours such as physical activity, cognitive training and healthy
   eating. This paper outlines the theory-, evidence- and person-based
   development of `Active Brains': a multi-domain digital behaviour change
   intervention to reduce cognitive decline amongst older adults. Methods
   During the initial planning phase, scoping reviews, consultation with
   PPI contributors and expert co-investigators and behavioural analysis
   collated and recorded evidence that was triangulated to inform
   provisional `guiding principles' and an intervention logic model. The
   following optimisation phase involved qualitative think aloud and
   semi-structured interviews with 52 older adults with higher and lower
   cognitive performance scores. Data were analysed thematically and
   informed changes and additions to guiding principles, the behavioural
   analysis and the logic model which, in turn, informed changes to
   intervention content. Results Scoping reviews and qualitative interviews
   suggested that the same intervention content may be suitable for
   individuals with higher and lower cognitive performance. Qualitative
   findings revealed that maintaining independence and enjoyment motivated
   engagement in intervention-targeted behaviours, whereas managing ill
   health was a potential barrier. Social support for engaging in such
   activities could provide motivation, but was not desirable for all.
   These findings informed development of intervention content and
   functionality that appeared highly acceptable amongst a sample of target
   users. Conclusions A digitally delivered intervention with minimal
   support appears acceptable and potentially engaging to older adults with
   higher and lower levels of cognitive performance. As well as informing
   our own intervention development, insights obtained through this process
   may be useful for others working with, and developing interventions for,
   older adults and/or those with cognitive impairment.},

Abstract = {Background: The Clinical Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of
   Work-related Mental Health Conditions in General Practice (the
   Guideline) was published in 2019. The objective of this trial is to
   implement the Guideline in general practice.
   Trial design: Implementing work-related Mental health conditions in
   general PRacticE is a hybrid III, parallel cluster randomised controlled
   trial undertaken in Australia. Its primary aim is to assess the
   effectiveness of a complex intervention on the implementation of the
   Guideline in general practice. Secondary aims are to assess patient
   health and work outcomes, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the
   trial, and to develop a plan for sustainability.
   Methods: A total of 86 GP clusters will be randomly allocated either to
   the intervention arm, where they will receive a complex intervention
   comprising academic detailing, enrolment in a community of practice and
   resources, or to the control arm, where they will not receive the
   intervention. GP guideline concordance will be assessed at baseline and
   9 months using virtual simulated patient scenarios. Patients who meet
   the eligibility criteria (>18years, employed, and receiving care from a
   participating GP for a suspected or confirmed work-related mental health
   condition) will be invited to complete surveys about their health and
   work participation and provide access to their health service use data.
   Data on health service use and work participation compensation claim
   data will be combined with measures of guideline concordance and patient
   outcomes to inform an economic evaluation. A realist evaluation will be
   conducted to inform the development of a plan for sustainability.
   Results: We anticipate that GPs who receive the intervention will have
   higher guideline concordance than GPs in the control group. We also
   anticipate that higher concordance will translate to better health and
   return-to-work outcomes for patients, as well as cost-savings to
   society.
   Conclusions: The trial builds on a body of work defining the role of GPs
   in compensable injury, exploring their concerns, and developing
   evidence-based guidelines to address them. Implementation of these
   guidelines has the potential to deliver improvements in GP care, patient
   health, and return-to-work outcomes.},

Title = {Person-Specific Dose-Finding for a Digital Messaging Intervention to
   Promote Physical Activity},

Abstract = {Objective: Digital messaging is an established method for promoting
   physical activity. Systematic approaches for dose-finding have not been
   widely used in behavioral intervention development. We apply system
   identification tools from control systems engineering to estimate
   dynamical models and inform decision rules for digital messaging
   intervention to promote physical activity. Method: Insufficiently active
   emerging and young adults (n = 45) wore an activity monitor that
   recorded minute-level step counts and heart rate and received 0-6
   digital messages daily on their smartphone for 6 months. Messages were
   drawn from 3 content libraries (move more, sit less, inspirational
   quotes). Location recordings via location services in the user's
   smartphone were used to lookup weather indices at the time and place of
   message delivery. Following system identification, responses to each
   message type were simulated under different conditions. Response
   features were extracted to summarize dynamic processes. Results: A
   generic model based on composite data was conservative and did not
   capture the heterogeneous responses evident in person-specific models.
   No messages were uniformly ineffective but responses to specific message
   content in different contexts varied between people. Exterior
   temperature at the time of message receipt moderated the size of some
   message effects. Conclusions: A generic model of message effects on
   physical activity can provide the initial evidence for context-sensitive
   decision rules in a just-in-time adaptive intervention, but it is likely
   to be error-prone and inefficient. As individual data accumulates,
   person-specific models should he estimated to optimize treatment and
   evolve as people are exposed to new environments and accumulate new
   experiences.},

Title = {Posttraumatic stress disorder intervention for people with severe mental
   illness in a low-income country primary care setting: a randomized
   feasibility trial protocol},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Background: In this protocol, we outline a mixed-methods randomized
   feasibility trial of Brief Relaxation, Education and Trauma Healing
   (BREATHE) Ethiopia. BREATHE Ethiopia is a culturally and contextually
   adapted intervention for PTSD in participants with severe mental
   illness. BREATHE Ethiopia maps onto the World Health Organization's
   guidelines for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment in low-
   and middle-income country primary care settings.
   Methods: Specifically, this study includes a non-randomized pre-pilot (n
   = 5) and a randomized feasibility trial comparing BREATHE Ethiopia to
   Treatment as Usual (n = 40) to assess trial procedures, acceptability,
   and feasibility of intervention delivery, and investigate potential
   effectiveness and implementation. In a process evaluation, we will
   collect data that will be critical for a future fully randomized
   controlled trial, including the numbers of participants who are
   eligible, who consent, who engage in treatment, and who complete the
   assessments, as well as the feasibility and acceptability of assessments
   and the intervention. Qualitative data on facilitators and barriers to
   intervention delivery and quantitative data on provider fidelity to the
   intervention and participant and provider satisfaction will also be
   collected. Quantitative assessments at baseline, post-treatment, 1-month
   follow-up, and 3-month follow-up will assess change in mental health
   symptoms and functional impairment and hypothesized intervention
   mechanisms, including knowledge about PTSD, stigma, trauma-related
   cognitions, and physiological arousal.
   Discussion: Findings from this study will inform a future fully-powered
   randomized controlled trial, and if found to be effective, the
   intervention has the potential to be integrated into mental healthcare
   scale-up efforts in other low-resource settings.},

   assisted withdrawal (also referred to as detoxification), and aftercare
   support but outcomes are poor with low proportions engaging in after
   care and high relapse rates. An approach of structured preparation
   before alcohol detoxification (SPADe) puts an emphasis on introducing
   lifestyle changes, development of coping strategies for cravings, stress
   and emotions as well as introducing changes to the immediate family and
   social environment in advance of alcohol cessation. Such a
   pre-habilitation paradigm compliments the established treatment
   approach. The key research question was: can we design a large scale,
   randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will answer whether such an
   approach is more effective than usual care in helping individuals to
   maintain longer periods of alcohol abstinence?
   Methods: This is a pragmatic, parallel, two-arm, feasibility RCT
   comparing SPADe and usual care against usual care only in maintaining
   alcohol abstinence in adults with alcohol dependence receiving care in
   two community addiction services in London. Feasibility outcomes,
   exploration of primary and secondary clinical outcomes and health
   economic outcomes are analysed. The trial follows the guidelines of
   phase 2 of the Medical Research Council (MRC) for complex interventions.
   Results: We were able to recruit 48/50 participants during a period of 9
   months. Retention in the trial for the whole period of the 12 months was
   75\%. Treatment compliance was overall 44\%. Data completion for the
   primary outcome was 65\%, 50\% and 63\% at 3, 6 and 12 months,
   respectively. The intervention group had more days abstinent in the
   previous 90 days at the 12 months (n = 54.5) versus control (n = 41.5).
   Conclusions: The results of this feasibility trial indicate that with
   the appropriate modifications, a full multicentred trial would be
   possible to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a
   pre-habilitation approach such as the SPADe group intervention in
   addition to usual care against usual care only.},

Title = {Acceptability and feasibility of peer-administered group interpersonal
   therapy for depression for people living with HIV/AIDS-a pilot study in

Abstract = {BackgroundPsychological treatments are widely tested and have been
   effective in treating depressive symptoms. However, implementation of
   psychological treatments in the real world and in diverse populations
   remains difficult due to several interacting barriers. In this study, we
   assessed the acceptability and feasibility of peer-administered group
   interpersonal therapy for depressive symptoms among people living with
   HIV/AIDS in Northwest Ethiopia.MethodWe conducted a single-arm,
   peer-administered, group interpersonal therapy intervention with eight
   weekly sessions from 15 August to 15 December 2019 among people living
   with HIV/AIDS in Northwest Ethiopia. Four interpersonal therapy groups
   were formed for the intervention with a total of 31
   participants.ResultsOf the 31 recruited participants, 29 completed the
   intervention providing a retention rate of 93.5\%. The process of the
   intervention and its outcomes were highly acceptable as most
   participants expressed success in resolving their psychosocial problems,
   adjusting to life changes and coping with stigma. The intervention was
   also reported to be feasible despite anticipated barriers such as access
   to transportation, perceived stigma and confidentiality concerns. The
   post-intervention assessment revealed significant reduction in
   depressive symptoms (mean difference (MD)=9.92; t=-7.82; 95\%
   CI,-12.54,-7.31; p<0.001), improvement in perceived social support
   (MD=0.79; t=2.84; 95\% CI, 0.22, 1.37; p=0.009) and quality of life
   (MD=0.39; t=4.58; 95\% CI, 0.21, 0.56; p<0.001).ConclusionGroup
   interpersonal therapy is feasible and acceptable, and people living with
   HIV/AIDS can benefit from group interpersonal therapy in managing
   depressive symptoms and in improving perceived social support and
   quality of life. Future studies should examine the effectiveness of
   group interpersonal therapy in this setting.},

Abstract = {Background Male condoms are effective in preventing common sexually
   transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy, if used
   correctly and consistently. However, condom use errors and problems are
   common and young people report negative experiences, such as reduced
   pleasure. The Kinsey Institute Home-Based Exercises for Responsible Sex
   (KIHERS) is a novel condom promotion intervention for young women, which
   aims to reduce condom errors and problems, increase self-efficacy and
   improve attitudes towards condoms, using a pleasure-focussed approach.
   The study objective was to test the operability, viability and
   acceptability of an adapted version of the KIHERS intervention with
   young women aged 16-25 years in the United Kingdom (UK) (Home-Based
   Exercises for Responsible Sex-UK (HERS-UK). Methods A repeated-measures
   single-arm design was used, with a baseline (T1) and two follow-up
   assessments (T2 and T3), conducted 4 weeks and 8 weeks post intervention
   over a 3-month period. Participants were provided a condom kit
   containing different condoms and lubricants and were asked to experiment
   with condoms alone using a dildo and/or with a sexual partner. Ten
   process evaluation interviews were conducted post intervention. Results
   Fifty-five young women received the intervention; 36 (65\%) completed T2
   and 33 (60\%) completed T3. Condom use errors and problems decreased,
   self-efficacy increased and attitudes towards condoms improved
   significantly. The proportion of participants who reported using a
   condom for intercourse in the past 4 weeks increased from T1 (20; 47\%)
   to T2 (27; 87\%) and T3 (23; 77\%) and using lubricant with a condom for
   intercourse increased from T1 (6; 30\%) to T2 (13; 48\%)) and T3 (16;
   70\%). However, motivation to use condoms did not change. Cronbach's
   alpha scores indicated good internal consistency of measures used.
   Qualitative data provided strong evidence for the acceptability of the
   intervention. Conclusions HERS-UK was implemented as intended and the
   recruitment strategy was successful within a college/university setting.
   This feasibility study provided an early indication of the potential
   effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention, and the benefits of
   using a pleasure-focussed approach with young women. Measures used
   captured change in outcome variables and were deemed fit for purpose.
   Future research should explore cost-effectiveness of this intervention,
   in a large-scale controlled trial using a diverse sample and targeting
   young women most at risk of STIs.},

Abstract = {Objective To examine short- and long-term effects of a group singing
   program on older adults' perceived physical and mental health levels,
   and also investigate subjective well-being (life satisfaction,
   positive/negative affect and hedonic balance), body balance and serum
   biomarkers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) as
   putative mediating mechanisms, controlling for the cognitive status of
   the participants. Design: The randomized controlled trial included 149
   participants (60 to 95 years), allocated to an immediate intervention
   group (IG) or a wait-list active control group (WLG). The intervention
   comprised 34 sessions of group singing during 4-months. Main outcome
   measures: Self-report measures of physical health, anxiety, stress, and
   depression. Blinded assessments were conducted at baseline,
   post-intervention (4 months) and follow-up (6 months). Results:
   Participants in the IG reported a lower decline in perceived physical
   health after the intervention, as compared to the WLG. These benefits
   were maintained at follow-up. Singing-related changes in physical and
   mental health outcomes were mediated via an increase in positive affect.
   Moderation results showed that participants with very low cognitive
   functioning reported more anxiety and depression symptoms after the
   intervention. Conclusions: These findings provide further understanding
   on the psychological and physical mechanisms and effects of group
   singing in older adults.},

Abstract = {BackgroundConduct disorder (CD) is a complex mental disorder
   characterized by severe rule-breaking and aggressive behavior. While
   studies have shown that several therapeutic interventions are effective
   in treating CD symptoms, researchers call for treatments based on
   etiological knowledge and potential patho-mechanisms.
   Mentalization-based treatment (MBT) may represent such a treatment
   approach: Studies have shown that individuals with CD show mentalizing
   deficits and that mentalizing might represent a protective factor
   against the development of the disorder. As MBT focuses on the
   understanding of social behavior in terms of mental states, fostering
   mentalizing might help CD individuals to (re)gain an adaptive way of
   coping with negative emotions especially in social interactions and thus
   reduce aggressive behavior. For this purpose, MBT was adapted for
   adolescents with CD (MBT-CD). This is a protocol of a feasibility and
   pilot study to inform the planning of a prospective RCT. The primary aim
   is to estimate the feasibility of an RCT based on the acceptability of
   the intervention and the scientific assessments by CD individuals and
   their families indicated by quantitative and qualitative data, as well
   as based on necessary organizational resources to conduct an RCT. The
   secondary aim is to investigate the course of symptom severity and
   mentalizing skills.MethodsThe bi-center study is carried out in two
   outpatient settings associated with university hospitals (Heidelberg and
   Mainz) in Germany. Adolescents aged between 11 and 18 years with a CD or
   oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) diagnosis are included. Participants
   receive MBT-CD for 6 to 12 months. The primary outcome of the
   feasibility study (e.g., recruitment and adherence rates) will be
   descriptively analyzed. Multilevel modeling will be used to investigate
   secondary outcome data.DiscussionFostering the capacity to mentalize
   social interactions triggering non-mentalized, aggressive behavior might
   help CD individuals to behave more adaptively. The feasibility trial is
   essential for gathering information on how to properly conduct MBT-CD
   including appropriate scientific assessments in this patient group, in
   order to subsequently investigate the effectiveness of MBT-CD in an
   RCT.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02988453. November 30,

Abstract = {Although Life Skills programs showed to improve the psychological and
   physical wellbeing of individuals, little attention has been paid,
   worldwide and in the Arab countries in specific to implementing life
   skills intervention for university students. In this study, we tested
   the effectiveness of a life skills based health promotion intervention
   KHOTWA (STEP) in enhancing the wellbeing of university students in
   Lebanon, a country that faces economic and political instability. This
   is a quasi-experimental study, with pre and post-test,
   intervention-control design. Each group was formed of 78 participants
   studying in a private university in Lebanon. Mixed design was used to
   address the process and outcomes objectives of the intervention. The
   program was carried online due to COVID-19 pandemic. Significant
   differences were observed between the intervention and the control
   groups for life skills, dietary habits and mental health scores at the
   3-month follow-up. For the intervention group, a significant increase
   was observed in the mean score of each of the following Life Skills
   subscales: self-care (p=0.001), work and study (p=0.013), career and
   education planning (p=0.011) and looking forward/goal settings
   (p<0.001). Students also achieved a healthier eating habit compared to
   those in the control group by decreasing their consumption of processed
   food. There was no significant effect in terms of body mass index
   (p=0.827). Also, there was a significant change in the mental health
   status (p=0.012) only in the intervention group as its mean score
   decreased after 3months of the intervention implementation. This
   intervention enhances the mental health and promotes healthy habits
   leading consequently to a better quality of life and more productivity
   amongst university students. Therefore, such interventions should be
   replicated in other similar context to improve university students'
   well-being.},

Title = {A real-world feasibility study of the PLAYshop: a brief intervention to

Abstract = {Background Development of physical literacy, defined as ``the
   motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding
   to value and take responsibility for engagement in physical activities
   for life,{''} can support children's physically active behaviors and
   consequent health benefits. Little research has explored interventions
   to improve children's physical literacy, although substantive evidence
   shows parents play a key role in children's physically active behaviors
   and development of fundamental movement skills. The purpose of this
   study was to explore the feasibility of a novel, physical literacy
   program (the PLAYshop) designed to build parents' self-efficacy to
   support their child's physical literacy. Methods A non-randomized,
   one-arm concurrent nested design was used. Thirty-five parents of young
   children (3-8 years of age) attended a 75-min workshop inclusive of
   interactive activities, educational messages, and the provision of
   resources focused on core physical literacy concepts. Pre- and
   post-workshop surveys used quantitative measures to assess parents'
   satisfaction, knowledge, confidence, and intention to adopt practices.
   Follow-up interviews qualitatively explored the implementation
   experiences of both parents and facilitators. Paired t tests and
   thematic analysis were undertaken. Results Of the 33 eligible parents,
   23 completed both pre- and post-workshop surveys. Follow-up interviews
   were completed with 11 parents and four workshop facilitators. Parents'
   self-reported knowledge and confidence to support their child's physical
   literacy development significantly increased after PLAYshop
   participation. The majority of parents were satisfied with the workshop
   and motivated to apply learnings at home with their child. Workshop
   facilitators identified seven workshop strengths (e.g., workshop
   champions and skilled facilitators) and four challenges (e.g.,
   recruitment and unfavorable spaces). Limitations include the lack of
   control group and recruitment challenges. Conclusions The PLAYshop was
   perceived positively by parents and facilitators and appeared to improve
   parent self-efficacy and intention to promote physical literacy with
   their child. Recruitment and attendance were key implementation
   challenges. The findings from this real-world study support the
   preliminary feasibility of the PLAYshop intervention and highlight areas
   to improve the intervention and recruitment prior to efficacy testing in
   a more rigorous trial format.},

Title = {Feasibility and acceptability of an enhanced cognitive behavioural
   therapy programme for parent-child dyads with anxiety disorders: a
   mixed-methods pilot trial protocol},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Background: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most widely
   recognised and efficacious psychological therapy for the treatment of
   anxiety disorders in children and adults. However, suboptimal remission
   rates indicate room for improvement in treatments, particularly when
   both children and their parents have anxiety disorders. Bidirectional
   transmission and maintenance of anxiety within parent-child dyads could
   be better targeted by CBT, to improve treatment outcomes for children
   and parents with anxiety disorders. This study aimed to develop and
   evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a concurrent parent-child
   enhanced CBT intervention that targets the individual's anxiety
   disorder(s), as well as the bidirectional factors that influence and
   maintain anxiety in the dyad.
   Methods: Feasibility and acceptability of the proposed CBT protocol will
   be evaluated in an open-label pilot trial of the intervention utilising
   qualitative and quantitative data collection. Ten parent-child dyad
   participants (n = 20) with anxiety disorders will be recruited for the
   proposed intervention. The intervention is based on an empirically
   supported 10-week CBT programme for anxiety disorders in adults, adapted
   to be delivered to parent-child dyads concurrently, and to target
   anxious modelling and overprotective behaviours through joint
   observational exposures. Intervention feasibility will be explored by
   pre-post symptom change on a range of clinician- and self-report
   measures to determine preliminary indications of participants'
   intervention response and effect size calculations to estimate sample
   size for a future definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT).
   Additional feasibility measures will include recruitment rates,
   completion rates, and adherence to programme requirements. To explore
   participant acceptability of the intervention, qualitative interviews
   will be conducted with five parent-child dyads who complete the
   intervention (n = 10), along with five parent-child dyads with anxiety
   symptoms who express interest in the intervention (n = 10).
   Acceptability measures will include prospective and retrospective
   quantitative self-report and qualitative interview data.
   Discussion: This pilot trial will utilise a mixed-methods design to
   determine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering an enhanced
   CBT intervention for the concurrent treatment of parent-child dyads with
   anxiety disorders. The results of this trial will inform the development
   and implementation of a future definitive randomised clinical trial to
   evaluate intervention efficacy.},

Title = {Development and assessment of feasibility of a community-based peer

   adolescent motherhood in Harare, Zimbabwe},

Abstract = {Background Adolescent mothers in Zimbabwe often experience stigma,
   isolation, and lack coping skills and resources to successfully navigate
   motherhood. Social isolation and stigma are linked to poor mental health
   outcomes. No interventions currently address mental health of adolescent
   mothers in Zimbabwe. Peer support groups in other contexts have been
   effective at increasing social connectedness, self-esteem, and
   self-efficacy, providing coping mechanisms to manage stigma experiences,
   in addition to empowering and improving mental health of adolescents and
   adolescent mothers. To develop a community-based peer support
   intervention, we aimed to understand the unique needs of adolescent
   mothers, how peer support groups could address those needs, and the
   feasibility of implementing the intervention. Methods Focus group
   discussions were conducted with 86 adolescent mothers aged 14-18 years,
   24 community health workers, and 25 key community stakeholders in a
   low-income high-density community in Harare. Data were analyzed
   thematically using NVivo 12 software. Results Participants described
   adolescent mother experiences with stigma and social isolation, in
   addition to challenges including gossip, lack of employment and
   educational opportunities, and gaps in services and programming. Peer
   support groups for adolescent mothers were welcomed to improve mental
   health, social support, knowledge sharing, and skills building.
   Participants identified varying preferred frequency and duration of
   group sessions addressing topics including income generation, mental
   health, and gossip, facilitated by community health workers at health
   and community centers. The use of WhatsApp Messenger to support
   intervention efforts was welcomed as an affordable and user-friendly
   platform to share information. Implementation (i.e., training,
   supervision, frequency, location, and co-facilitation) was feasible.
   Conclusions Adolescent mothers, community health workers and key
   community stakeholders welcomed the peer support groups as a feasible
   way to address the mothers' needs.},

Title = {Enhancing the Behaviour Change Wheel with synthesis, stakeholder

   Quality of Psychological Interventions Delivered by Telephone' (EQUITy)
   research programme},

Abstract = {Background Using frameworks such as the Behaviour Change Wheel to
   develop behaviour change interventions can be challenging because
   judgement is needed at various points in the process and it is not
   always clear how uncertainties can be resolved. We propose a transparent
   and systematic three-phase process to transition from a research
   evidence base to a behaviour change intervention. The three phases
   entail evidence synthesis, stakeholder involvement and decision-making.
   We present the systematic development of an intervention to enhance the
   quality of psychological treatment delivered by telephone, as a worked
   example of this process. Method In phase 1 (evidence synthesis), we
   propose that the capabilities (C), opportunities (O) and motivations (M)
   model of behaviour change (COM-B) can be used to support the synthesis
   of a varied corpus of empirical evidence and to identify domains to be
   included in a proposed behaviour change intervention. In phase 2
   (stakeholder involvement), we propose that formal consensus procedures
   (e.g. the RAND Health/University of California-Los Angeles
   Appropriateness Methodology) can be used to facilitate discussions of
   proposed domains with stakeholder groups. In phase 3 (decision-making),
   we propose that behavioural scientists identify (with public/patient
   input) intervention functions and behaviour change techniques using the
   acceptability, practicability, effectiveness/cost-effectiveness,
   affordability, safety/side-effects and equity (APEASE) criteria. Results
   The COM-B model was a useful tool that allowed a multidisciplinary
   research team, many of whom had no prior knowledge of behavioural
   science, to synthesise effectively a varied corpus of evidence (phase 1:
   evidence synthesis). The RAND Health/University of California-Los
   Angeles Appropriateness Methodology provided a transparent means of
   involving stakeholders (patients, practitioners and key informants in
   the present example), a structured way in which they could identify
   which of 93 domains identified in phase 1 were essential for inclusion
   in the intervention (phase 2: stakeholder involvement). Phase 3
   (decision-making) was able to draw on existing Behaviour Change Wheel
   resources to revisit phases 1 and 2 and facilitate agreement among
   behavioural scientists on the final intervention modules. Behaviour
   changes were required at service, practitioner, patient and community
   levels. Conclusion Frameworks offer a foundation for intervention
   development but require additional elucidation at each stage of the
   process. The decisions adopted in this study are designed to provide an
   example on how to resolve challenges while designing a behaviour change
   intervention. We propose a three-phase process, which represents a
   transparent and systematic framework for developing behaviour change
   interventions in any setting.},

Title = {Implementation fidelity of the Systems for Person-Centered Elder Care
   (SPEC): a process evaluation study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Background: The Systems for Person-Centered Elder Care (SPEC), a complex
   intervention, was conducted to examine its effectiveness as a
   technology-enhanced, multidisciplinary, and integrated care model for
   frail older persons among ten nursing homes (NHs) in South Korea where
   formal long-term care has recently been introduced. The purpose of this
   study was to evaluate the implementation fidelity of the SPEC
   intervention and to identify moderating factors that influence the
   implementation fidelity.
   Methods: This study was a process evaluation based on an evidence-based
   framework for implementation fidelity using a mixed-methods design.
   Quantitative data from consultant logbooks, NH documentations, an
   information and communications technology (ICT) system, and a
   standardized questionnaire were collected from April 2015 to December
   2016 and analyzed by calculating the descriptive statistics.
   Semi-structured focus group interviews were held with multidisciplinary
   teams from the participating NHs. Qualitative data from a
   semi-structured questionnaire and the focus group interviews were
   analyzed using content analysis.
   Results: The SPEC program demonstrated good implementation fidelity, and
   adherence to the SPEC program was strong in all aspects, such as
   content, coverage, frequency, and duration. Of the participating on-site
   coordinators, 60\% reported that the SPEC model positively impacted
   needs assessment and the reporting system for resident care. The
   important facilitating factors were tailored facilitating strategies,
   assurance of the quality of delivery, and recruitment strategies.
   Conclusion: The effectiveness of the SPEC program was driven by good
   implementation fidelity. The key factors of good implementation fidelity
   were tailored delivery of evidence-based interventions over process
   evaluation work, facilitating strategies, and ICT support. Larger
   implementation studies with a more user-friendly ICT system are
   recommended.},

Title = {Skills-based intervention to enhance collaborative decision-making:
   systematic adaptation and open trial protocol for veterans with
   psychosis},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},

Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {Background: Collaborative decision-making is an innovative
   decision-making approach that assigns equal power and responsibility to
   patients and providers. Most veterans with serious mental illnesses like
   schizophrenia want a greater role in treatment decisions, but there are
   no interventions targeted for this population. A skills-based
   intervention is promising because it is well-aligned with the recovery
   model, uses similar mechanisms as other evidence-based interventions in
   this population, and generalizes across decisional contexts while
   empowering veterans to decide when to initiate collaborative
   decision-making. Collaborative Decision Skills Training (CDST) was
   developed in a civilian serious mental illness sample and may fill this
   gap but needs to undergo a systematic adaptation process to ensure fit
   for veterans.
   Methods: In aim 1, the IM Adapt systematic process will be used to adapt
   CDST for veterans with serious mental illness. Veterans and Veteran's
   Affairs (VA) staff will join an Adaptation Resource Team and complete
   qualitative interviews to identify how elements of CDST or service
   delivery may need to be adapted to optimize its effectiveness or
   viability for veterans and the VA context. During aim 2, an open trial
   will be conducted with veterans in a VA Psychosocial Rehabilitation and
   Recovery Center (PRRC) to assess additional adaptations, feasibility,
   and initial evidence of effectiveness.
   Discussion: This study will be the first to evaluate a collaborative
   decision-making intervention among veterans with serious mental illness.
   It will also contribute to the field's understanding of perceptions of
   collaborative decision-making among veterans with serious mental illness
   and VA clinicians, and result in a service delivery manual that may be
   used to understand adaptation needs generally in VA PRRCs.},

Abstract = {Background: Stress can negatively impact an individual's health and
   well-being and high levels of stress are noted to exist among college
   students today. While traditional treatment methods are plagued with
   stigma and transfer problems, newly developed wearable biofeedback
   devices may offer unexplored possibilities. Although these products are
   becoming commonplace and inexpensive, scientific evidence of the
   effectiveness of these products is scarce and their feasibility within
   research contexts are relatively unexplored. Conversely, companies are
   not required, and possibly reluctant, to release information on the
   efficacy of these products against their claims. Thus, in the present
   pilot, we assess the feasibility of using a real-time respiratory-based
   biofeedback device in preparation for a larger study. Our main aims were
   to assess device-adherence and collaboration with the company that
   develops and sells the device.
   Method: Data were collected from 39 college students who self-identified
   as experiencing chronic stress at a Southwestern university in the USA.
   Students were randomized into either a mindfulness-only control group
   without a biofeedback device (n = 21), or an experimental group with
   biofeedback device (n = 18). Both groups received mindfulness meditation
   training. Pre-test and post-test procedures were conducted 2 weeks
   apart. Further, both participant compliance and company compliance were
   assessed and collaboration with the company was evaluated.
   Results: Participant device-adherence as well as the company's
   collaboration necessary for a full-scale study was determined to be low.
   This may also have affected our results which showed a strong main
   effect for time for all outcome variables, suggesting all groups showed
   improvement in their levels of stress after the intervention period. No
   group by time effects were identified, however, indicating no added
   benefit of the biofeedback device.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest feasibility of future studies requires
   full collaboration and detailed and agreed upon data sharing procedures
   with the biofeedback company. The particular device under investigation
   added no value to the intervention outcomes and it was not feasible to
   continue a larger-scale study. Further, as the technology sector is
   innovating faster than it can validate products, we urge for open
   science collaborations between public and private sectors to properly
   develop evidence-based regulations that can withstand technological
   innovation while maintaining product quality, safety, and effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Background Home exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) is highly prevalent
   amongst pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries like India
   and Bangladesh. The literature on the efficacy of behaviour change
   interventions to reduce home exposure to SHS in pregnancy is scarce.
   Methods We employed a theory and evidence-based approach to develop an
   intervention using pregnant women as agents of change for their
   husband's smoking behaviours at home. A systematic review of SHS
   behaviour change interventions led us to focus on developing a
   multicomponent intervention and informed selection of behaviour change
   techniques (BCTs) for review in a modified Delphi survey. The modified
   Delphi survey provided expert consensus on the most effective BCTs in
   reducing home exposure to SHS. Finally, a qualitative interview study
   provided context and detailed understanding of knowledge, attitudes and
   practices around SHS. This insight informed the content and delivery of
   the proposed intervention components. Results The final intervention
   consisted of four components: a report on saliva cotinine levels of the
   pregnant woman, a picture booklet containing information about SHS and
   its impact on health as well strategies to negotiate a smoke-free home,
   a letter from the future baby to their father encouraging him to provide
   a smoke-free home, and automated voice reminder and motivational
   messages delivered to husbands on their mobile phone. Intervention
   delivery was in a single face-to-face session with a research assistant
   who explained the cotinine report, discussed key strategies for ensuring
   a smoke-free environment at home and practised with pregnant women how
   they would share the booklet and letter with their husband and
   supportive family members. Conclusion A theory and evidence-based
   approach informed the development of a multicomponent behaviour change
   intervention, described here. The acceptability and feasibility of the
   intervention which was subsequently tested in a pilot RCT in India and
   Bangladesh will be published later.},

Title = {Implementation and preliminary testing of a theory-guided nursing
   discharge teaching intervention for adult inpatients aged 50 and over
   with multimorbidity: a pragmatic feasibility study protocol},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {Background: Discharge teaching by nurses during hospitalization is
   essential to provide multimorbid inpatients with the knowledge and
   skills to self-manage their health conditions. However, available
   disease-specific teaching guidelines do not address the cumulative
   complexity of multiple chronic diseases that occur with greater
   frequency in older adults. Therefore, there is a need for a discharge
   teaching intervention which uses concepts that specifically address the
   needs of these patients, such as considering their level of activation
   (i.e. knowledge, skills and confidence to self-manage their health) and
   the burden of multimorbid disease. The objectives of this pragmatic
   study will be to (1) test the feasibility of implementing a nursing
   discharge teaching intervention and (2) conduct a preliminary test of
   this novel discharge teaching intervention with adult inpatients age 50
   or greater who have multiple comorbid conditions.
   Methods: This study uses a two-group pre-posttest design. Participants
   are drawn from medical units in three hospitals in the French-speaking
   part of Switzerland. The implementation of the intervention will be
   facilitated by implementation strategies from the Theoretical Domains
   Framework and the Behavior Change Wheel and will target change in
   nurses' teaching behaviours. Implementation outcomes will include
   measures of feasibility of the implementation strategies and the
   intervention process. Participants in the intervention group will
   receive tailored discharge teaching by trained teaching nurses. Patient
   outcomes will inform the preliminary testing of the intervention and
   will be measured with validated questionnaires assessing patients'
   activation level, health confidence, perceived readiness for discharge,
   experience with the discharge process and rate of and time to
   readmission.
   Discussion: The study takes a pragmatic approach to examining the
   feasibility of implementing the discharge teaching intervention to
   contribute to the knowledge development within the context of the
   real-world practice setting. Results will provide the foundation for
   clinical trials to build evidence for widespread adoption of this
   intervention.},

Title = {Addressing the mental health needs of adolescents in South African
   communities: a protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Background: Like many low- and middle-income countries, almost half of
   the proportion of the South African population is under the age of 25.
   Given the peak age of onset for most mental health problems is in
   adolescence, it is vital that adolescents have access to mental health
   counselling. There are several initiatives to increase access to mental
   health counselling in South Africa, primarily through the integration of
   counselling for common mental disorders (CMD) into primary health care
   services, but adolescents (15-18 years of age) generally do not utilize
   these services. To address this gap, we will undertake a study to
   explore the feasibility of conducting a trial of the effectiveness of a
   community-based mental health counselling intervention for adolescents
   at-risk for a CMD.
   Methods: The study is a feasibility trial of the ASPIRE intervention, a
   four-session blended multi-component counselling intervention adapted
   for South African adolescents at risk for depression and alcohol use
   disorders. We will enrol 100 adolescents from community settings and
   randomly assign them to the ASPIRE intervention or a comparison
   condition. Feasibility measures, such as rates of recruitment, consent
   to participate in the trial and retention, will be calculated.
   Qualitative interviews with participants and counsellors will explore
   the acceptability of the intervention. The primary outcomes for a
   subsequent trial would be reductions in symptoms of depression and days
   of heavy drinking which will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3
   months post-randomization.
   Discussion: This feasibility trial using a mixed-methods design will
   allow us to determine whether we can move forward to a larger
   effectiveness trial of the ASPIRE intervention.},

Title = {Very preterm infants engage in an intervention to train their control of

   Training (ACT) randomised trial},

Abstract = {Background: Very premature birth (gestational age between 28 and 31 + 6
   weeks) is associated with increased risk of cognitive delay and
   attention deficit disorder, which have been linked to anomalies in the
   development of executive functions (EFs) and their precursors. In
   particular, very preterm (VP) infants display anomalies in controlling
   attention and gathering task-relevant information. Early interventions
   that support attention control may be pivotal in providing a secure base
   for VP children's later attainments. The Attention Control Training
   (ACT) is a cognitive training intervention that targets infants'
   abilities to select visual information according to varying task demands
   but had not been tested in VP infants. We conducted a feasibility study
   to test the processes we intend to use in a trial delivering the ACT to
   VP infants.
   Methods and design: We tested recruitment and retention of VP infants
   and their families in a randomised trial, as well as acceptability and
   completion of baseline and outcome measures. To evaluate these aims, we
   used descriptive quantitative statistics and qualitative methods to
   analyse feedback from infants' caregivers. We also investigated the
   quality of eye-tracking data collected and indicators of infants'
   engagement in the training, using descriptive statistics.
   Results: Twelve VP infants were recruited, and 10 (83\%) completed the
   study. Participants' parents had high education attainment. The rate of
   completion of baseline and outcome measures was optimal. VP infants
   demonstrated engagement in the training, completing on average 84 min of
   training over three visits, and displaying improved performance during
   this training. Eye-tracking data quality was moderate, but this did not
   interfere with infants' engagement in the training.
   Discussion: The results suggest the ACT can be delivered to VP infants.
   However, challenges remain in recruitment of numerous and diverse
   samples. We discuss strategies to overcome these challenges informed by
   results of this study.},

Title = {Development and feasibility testing of a play-based psychosocial

Abstract = {Background Hospitalization can be a source of great stress for children
   and their families. In high-income countries, there are specialized
   staff to help children cope using different techniques including play.
   However, it is a major challenge in low and middle-income countries
   (LMIC) due to financial constraints and untrained human resource. The
   objective of study was to develop and test the feasibility and
   acceptance of a psychology trainee-delivered model postulated on
   employing play as a means of enhancing child-parent interactions leading
   to reduced stress during hospitalization. Methods This study was
   conducted in the paediatric ward of a tertiary care private hospital in
   Pakistan. Pre-intervention survey revealed that parental stress stemmed
   mainly from seeing their child irritable, distressed, or in pain. Using
   a theory of change model, a play-based psychosocial intervention was
   developed to address these factors. The intervention approach was
   informed by principles of Nurturing Care Framework and play therapy.
   Children between birth and 6 years admitted in the acute care ward were
   eligible. The intervention was delivered between March 2019 and December
   2020 by psychology trainees who were supervised by a clinical
   psychologist. The play-based sessions were delivered at the bedside and
   ranged from 20 to 40 min. Parents receiving the intervention were later
   interviewed for their stress, child emotions, and feedback about the
   service using structured surveys administered by psychology graduates.
   The trainees delivering the intervention were requested to provide their
   feedback as a written qualitative open-ended narrative. These narratives
   were analyzed using an inductive approach. Results The survey was
   conducted with 223 families with about half of the sample having
   children under 2 years of age. Forty-five percent of parents reported
   play intervention to be one of 3 key factors in improving their
   experience during hospital stay. Only 5\% of parents reported feeling
   stressed about the child illness after the intervention. Ninety to 96\%
   parents felt respected, listened to, and understood by the therapists.
   Thematic analysis of the feedback by trainees indicated the internship
   to be a useful experience and a new avenue for professional life whereas
   physicians appreciated the interventions. Conclusions The authors
   conclude that psychology trainees can feasibly deliver a play-based
   intervention under supervision for reduced stress in children and their
   parents during hospitalization with mutual benefits.},

Title = {A Novel Method for Assessing Design Fidelity in Web-Based Behavioral
   Interventions},

Abstract = {Objective: Delivery is one of the most common ways of assessing fidelity
   in behavioral interventions. However, there is a lack of research
   reporting on how well an intervention protocol reflects its proposed
   theoretical principles (design fidelity). This study presents a
   systematic method for assessing design fidelity and applies it to the
   eMotion web-based intervention targeting physical activity and
   depression. Method: The eMotion intervention comprises of 13 web-based
   modules, designed according to an underlying intervention map. An
   independent rater with expertise in behavior change coded the presence
   or absence of behavior change techniques (BCTs) in the content of
   eMotion. Results of coding were compared to the intervention designers'
   a priori specification for interrater reliability. Results: After
   discussion, the independent rater and the intervention designer had a
   high agreement for the presence of BCTs relating to behavioral
   activation (AC1 = 0.91) with ``demonstration of behavior{''} and
   ``monitoring of emotional consequences{''} having the lowest agreement
   (ACl < 0.4). There was also high agreement for the presence of BCTs
   targeting physical activity (AC1 = 0.88) with ``demonstration of
   behavior{''} and ``monitoring, of emotional consequences{''} having the
   lowest agreement (AC1 < 0.4). The eMotion description was then amended
   to align the interrater agreement. Conclusions: This study presents a
   novel method for assessing design fidelity. Developers of behavioral
   (and other multicomponent) interventions are encouraged to develop and
   refine this method and assess design fidelity in future interventions to
   ensure BCTs are operationalized as intended.},

Abstract = {Background There is a critical need for an intervention to improve
   nurses' eating and physical activity behaviours. As nurses spend a
   substantial proportion of their waking hours at work, concerted efforts
   to deliver such interventions in the workplace is growing. This study
   formed part of a multiphase programme of research that aimed to
   systematically develop an evidence-based and theory-informed workplace
   intervention to promote changes in eating and physical activity among
   nurses. Methods The intervention was developed iteratively, in line with
   Medical Research Council complex intervention guidelines. It involved
   four activities: (1) identifying the evidence base, (2) understanding
   the determinants of nurses' eating and physical activity behaviour
   change through theory-based qualitative interviews and survey, (3)
   identifying intervention options using the Behaviour Change Wheel, and
   (4) specifying intervention content and implementation options using a
   taxonomy of behaviour change techniques. Results Data from 13 randomised
   controlled trials indicated that workplace-based behaviour change
   interventions targeted to this population are effective in changing
   behaviour. The evidence base was, however, limited in quantity and
   quality. Nurses' beliefs about important factors determining their
   eating and physical activity behaviour were identified across 16
   qualitative interviews and 245 survey responses, and key determinants
   included environmental context and resources, behavioural regulation,
   emotion, beliefs about consequences, knowledge and optimism. Based on
   these findings, 22 behaviour change techniques suitable for targeting
   the identified determinants were identified and combined into a
   potential workplace intervention. Conclusions An evidence-based and
   theory-informed intervention tailored to the target population and
   setting has been explicitly conceptualised using a systematic approach.
   The proposed intervention addresses previous evidence gaps for the user
   population of nurses. Further to this, such an intervention, if
   implemented, has the potential to impact nurses' eating and physical
   activity behaviours and in turn, the health of nurses and the quality of
   healthcare delivery.},

Title = {A classroom intervention targeting working memory, attention and
   language skills: a cluster randomised feasibility trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background: International debate around the best models of speech and
   language therapy provision for children with language disorders has
   highlighted the need for research into classroom-based approaches and
   intervention dosage. Working memory (WM) is a cognitive skill linked to
   attention and language. `Recall to Enhance Children's Attention,
   Language and Learning' (RECALL) is a novel, 6-week, classroom-based
   intervention delivered by health professionals (HPs) and teachers. It is
   designed to target WM and enhance attention and language skills in 4-5
   year olds.
   Methods: A cluster randomised feasibility trial was conducted to
   investigate aspects of the feasibility of a definitive trial to evaluate
   RECALL: (i) recruitment and sampling procedures; (ii) compliance and
   fidelity; (iii) the acceptability of RECALL to HPs and teachers; (iv)
   the appropriateness of the outcome measures. Six classes of 4-5 year
   olds participated: two received RECALL, two received an existing
   intervention targeting attention skills (not underpinned by WM theory),
   and two received education as usual (no intervention). Ten children in
   each class (n = 60) were sampled to assess the appropriateness of the
   outcome measures. Classroom observations were conducted to measure
   fidelity and semi-structured interviews with HPs, and teachers explored
   the acceptability of RECALL.
   Results: The recruitment targets were met, and all six schools completed
   the trial, but the sampling procedures require modification. Compliance
   was good (95\% of RECALL sessions were delivered), but fidelity to the
   intervention protocol varied between 76\% and 45\% across the two
   schools. This was influenced by large class sizes, child factors, and
   facilitator factors, e.g., their understanding of the theory
   underpinning the intervention. The lack of fidelity reduced the dose
   (number of practice items) accessed by individual children, particularly
   those most at risk. There were mixed findings regarding the
   acceptability of RECALL and the appropriateness of the outcome measures.
   Conclusions: The trial protocol could be easily scaled-up in a future
   definitive trial, with an amended sampling procedure. RECALL should be
   repackaged as a small group intervention to enhance the fidelity of its
   delivery and its acceptability to HPs and teachers. This study
   highlights the need for thorough training for professionals who deliver
   classroom-based interventions for children with language disorders.},

Abstract = {Introduction: An active play is designed to increase children's physical
   activity levels and fundamental movement skills through outdoor play and
   is well-suited to the needs of children with intellectual disabilities.
   However, no active play interventions have included children with
   intellectual disabilities. This study aims to investigate the
   feasibility of a school-based active play intervention for children with
   intellectual disabilities.
   Method: Children aged 7-12 years who had intellectual disabilities and
   were independently ambulatory were eligible. This single-group 17-week
   intervention was implemented in two additional support needs schools. It
   consisted of a weekly 1-h active play session incorporating 30 min of
   structured games and 30 min of free play. Feasibility of
   recruitment/retention, adherence, and outcome measures were
   investigated. Outcome measures included school-based physical activity
   (ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer), fundamental movement skills (Test of
   Gross Motor Development-2), and social interactions (Playground
   Observation of Peer Engagement). Staff feedback was collected via
   open-ended questionnaire. Feasibility was investigated using descriptive
   statistics and questionnaire data analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Potential pre-post changes were investigated for school-based physical
   activity, fundamental movement skills, and social interactions using
   paired samples t tests. The progression criteria were (1) > 50\% of
   eligible participants recruited, (2) > 50\% of recruited participants
   retained, (3) > 50\% of active play sessions spent in MVPA, and (4) >
   50\% of participants complete outcome measurements.
   Results: All progression criteria were met. Recruitment and retention
   rates were 100\% (n=21 participants). Intervention adherence was high,
   based on data from n=1 school, with 90\% of participants attending all
   sessions. Measuring physical activity using accelerometry and
   fundamental movement skills using the Test of Gross Motor Development-2
   were feasible. The Playground Observation of Peer Engagement tool to
   measure social interactions was not feasible. The only significant
   increase post-intervention was for social interactions during structured
   play (pre-post mean difference: -1.46, 95\% CI -1.99, -0.93). Staff
   feedback was positive with the intervention well received by schools and
   potential benefits post-intervention identified by teachers.
   Conclusion: The Go2Play Active Play intervention is feasible for
   children with intellectual disabilities. Future research should further
   investigate feasibility and implementation on a larger scale using a
   pilot cluster randomised controlled trial.},

Abstract = {Health psychology is at the forefront of developing and disseminating
   evidence, theories, and methods that have improved the understanding of
   health behaviour change. However, current dissemination approaches may
   be insufficient for promoting broader application and impact of this
   evidence to benefit the health of patients and the public. Nevertheless,
   behaviour change theory/methods typically directed towards health
   behaviours are now used in implementation science to understand and
   support behaviour change in individuals at different health system
   levels whose own behaviour impacts delivering evidence-based health
   behaviour change interventions. Despite contributing to implementation
   science, health psychology is perhaps doing less to draw from it. A
   redoubled focus on implementation science in health psychology could
   provide novel prospects for enhancing the impact of health behaviour
   change evidence. We report a Health Psychology Review-specific
   review-of-reviews of trials of health behaviour change interventions
   published from inception to April 2020. We identified 34 reviews and
   assessed whether implementation readiness of behaviour change
   interventions was discussed. We then narratively review how
   implementation science has integrated theory/methods from health
   psychology and related discipline. Finally, we demonstrate how greater
   synergy between implementation science and health psychology could
   promote greater follow-through on advances made in the science of health
   behaviour change.},

Title = {Pilot Randomised Evaluation of Singing in Dementia (PRESIDE): protocol

Abstract = {Background: As the number of people living with dementia grows, so does
   the need to provide them with adequate psychosocial support. Many people
   with dementia live at home with family carers, who also require social
   and emotional support to cope with their role. Community group singing
   has received attention for its potential to support people with dementia
   and their carers. It is postulated that singing can improve cognitive
   function, strengthen the bonds between care partners and help to
   establish social support networks. However, there is a lack of rigorous
   evidence of singing's benefits for this population. This study aims to
   test the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial of community
   singing in dementia, to pave the way for a larger, conclusive study.
   Methods: The PRESIDE study is designed as a two-arm, parallel-group
   randomised trial with a waiting list control. Dyads consisting of a
   person with dementia (n = 80) and their carer (n = 80) will be
   recruited. Each dyad will be randomised either to attend 10 weeks of
   community group singing sessions straight away or to wait for 3 months
   before attending the sessions. The singing sessions will be led by
   experienced professional musicians and will last about 90 min, including
   time for socialising. The primary outcome of this study is the
   attainment of feasibility criteria around recruitment, retention and the
   acceptability of the waiting list control. Secondary outcomes include
   the quality of life, mood, cognition, and musical engagement of the
   person with dementia, and quality of life, mood, and
   experiences/challenges of the carer. These data will be collected during
   home visits at baseline, and 3 and 6 months post-baseline.
   Discussion: Despite growing public interest in the positive effects of
   singing, and encouraging findings from qualitative and non-randomised
   quantitative studies, there is a lack of rigorous evidence. This is the
   first randomised controlled trial of community group singing for people
   with dementia in Europe, to our knowledge. If the results favour a full
   trial, conclusively demonstrating the effectiveness of group singing
   could positively affect the opportunities available to
   community-dwelling people with dementia and their carers.},

Title = {Economic evaluation of a web-based menu planning intervention to improve
   childcare service adherence with dietary guidelines},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {BackgroundDespite the known benefits of healthy eating in childhood, few
   Australian childcare services provide food that is consistent with
   dietary guidelines. The effectiveness of a web-based menu planning
   intervention to increase childcare service provision of healthy foods
   and decrease provision of discretionary foods in long day-care services
   in Australia was assessed in a randomised controlled trial. Here we
   consider the costs, consequences, cost-effectiveness and budget impact
   of the intervention using data collected within the trial.MethodsThe
   prospective trial-based economic evaluation involved 54 childcare
   services across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Services were
   randomised to a 12-month intervention or usual care. The intervention
   involved access to a web-based menu planning and decision support tool
   and online resources. Effectiveness measures included mean number of
   food groups, overall menu and individual food group compliance with
   dietary guidelines, and mean servings of food groups at 12months. Costs
   (reported in \$AUD, 2017/18) were evaluated from both health sector and
   societal perspectives. The direct cost to support uptake of the
   intervention was calculated, as were costs to each childcare service.
   The incremental cost of the intervention was calculated as the net
   difference in the cost to undertake menu planning and review plus the
   direct cost of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
   (ICERs) including uncertainty intervals were estimated for differences
   in costs and effects between intervention and control groups. A relative
   value index was calculated to determine overall value for
   money.ResultsOver the 12months of the trial, we calculated a difference
   in cost between usual practice and intervention groups of - \$482 (95\%
   UI - \$859, - \$56). While the measured increase in menu and food group
   compliance within the trial did not reach statistical significance,
   there were significant improvements in mean servings of fruit and
   discretionary food, represented in the cost-consequence analysis. The
   calculated relative value index of 1.1 suggests that the intervention
   returns acceptable value for money for the outcomes
   generated.ConclusionCompared to usual practice, web-based programmes may
   offer an efficient and sustainable alternative for childcare services to
   improve the provision of healthy foods to children in their care.Trial

Abstract = {Background: This article reports the results from a feasibility study of
   an intervention ('E-PLAYS') aimed at supporting children who experience
   difficulties with social communication. E-PLAYS is based around a dyadic
   computer game, which aims to develop collaborative and communication
   skills. A pilot study found that when E-PLAYS was delivered by
   researchers, improvements on communication test scores and on
   collaborative behaviours were observed. The aim of this study was to
   ascertain the feasibility of running a full-scale trial to test the
   effectiveness of E-PLAYS in a National Health Service (NHS) setting with
   delivery by speech and language therapists and teaching assistants.
   Methods: The study was a two-arm feasibility cluster-randomised
   controlled trial of the E-PLAYS intervention with a treatment as usual
   control arm. Data relating to recruitment and retention, treatment
   fidelity, acceptability to participants, suitability of outcomes and
   feasibility of collecting health economic measures and of determining
   cost-effectiveness were collected. Speech and language therapists
   selected suitable children (ages 4-7 years old) from their caseload.
   E-PLAYS intervention (experimental group) was then delivered by teaching
   assistants overseen by speech and language therapists. The control group
   received usual care. Assessments included blinded language measures and
   observations, non-blinded teacher-reported measures of peer relations
   and classroom behaviour and non-blinded parent-reported use of health
   and education resources and quality of life.
   Results: Planned recruitment was for 70 children, in the event, 50
   children were recruited which was sufficient for feasibility purposes.
   E-PLAYS was very highly rated by children, teaching assistants and
   speech and language therapists and treatment fidelity did not pose any
   issues. We were able to collect health economic data which suggests that
   E-PLAYS would be a low-cost intervention.
   Conclusion: Based on recruitment, retention and adherence rates and our
   outcome measures, a full-scale randomised controlled trial estimated
   appears feasible and warranted to assess the effectiveness of E-PLAYS
   for use by the NHS and schools.},

Title = {Internalized weight stigma and intuitive eating among stressed adults
   during a mindful yoga intervention: associations with changes in
   mindfulness and self-compassion},

Abstract = {Purpose Internalized weight stigma (IWS) is common in the United States
   of America across body weight categories, and is implicated in the
   development of distress and unhealthy eating behaviors (e.g. overeating,
   disordered eating) that can foster poor cardiometabolic health. While
   emerging intervention research shows early promise in reducing IWS,
   long-term efficacy is unclear and novel strategies remain needed. This
   analysis examined whether participation in a mindful yoga intervention
   was associated with reduced IWS and increased intuitive eating, an
   adaptive eating behavior, and whether these changes correlated with each
   other or with changes in mindfulness and self-compassion. Methods
   Participants were stressed adults with low fruit and vegetable intake (N
   = 78, 64.1\% White, M. Body Mass Index 25.59 +/- 4.45) enrolled in a
   parent clinical trial of a 12-week mindful yoga intervention. Validated
   self-report measures of IWS, intuitive eating, mindfulness, and
   self-compassion were administered at pre-treatment, mid-treatment (8
   weeks), post-treatment (12 weeks), and 4-month follow-up (24 weeks).
   Results Linear mixed modeling revealed significant improvements in IWS
   and intuitive eating across the four timepoints (p < .001). Reduced IWS
   correlated with increased intuitive eating pre- to post-treatment (p =
   .01). Improved self-compassion and mindfulness correlated with intuitive
   eating (both p = . 04), but not IWS (p = .74 and p = .56, respectively).
   Conclusion This study offers preliminary support for the hypothesis that
   mindful yoga may promote intuitive eating and reduce IWS among stressed
   adults with poor diet, and suggests that changes in these factors may
   co-occur over time. Further investigation with controlled designs is
   necessary to better understand the temporality and causality of these
   relationships.},

Abstract = {Introduction: A healthy lifestyle could have a positive impact in
   reducing the incidence of some long-term sequelae secondary to pediatric
   cancer treatments. Motivational communication (MC) is effective at
   improving healthy lifestyle habits, especially when patients experience
   change as a challenge. To date, there is no available intervention
   program using MC that promotes healthy lifestyles in pediatric oncology.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop the first MC training
   program for professionals in pediatric oncology and assess its
   feasibility and acceptability.
   Materials and methods: Following standard procedures involving
   professionals, we developed a professional-targeted training named the
   Motivation Cafes, consisting in six sessions of core MC skills for
   healthcare professionals who wish to positively impact lifestyles of
   families in pediatric oncology. We used a mixed-methods
   quantitative-qualitative study to assess the program feasibility and
   acceptability. Professionals in nutrition and physical activity (N =16)
   attended two rounds of the training and completed surveys to evaluate
   the training. They reported self-efficacy and knowledge in MC.
   Participation and retention rates were used to assess acceptability and
   feasibility, and a thematic analysis of the open-ended questions was
   performed to identify strengths and weaknesses of the program to further
   refine the program. We used non-parametric statistics to compare
   pre-post changes on measures of self-efficacy and knowledge in MC.
   Results: Attendance and retention (average 4.2/6 sessions completed)
   were high, suggesting very good adherence and feasibility. We also found
   high levels of acceptability and pertinence of the program (i.e. >90\%).
   The results suggested probable improvements in self-efficacy and
   knowledge, but these were not statistically significant given the
   limited sample size.
   Conclusion: The training Motivation Cafes is now ready to be pilot
   tested in pediatric cancer care centers.},

Abstract = {Objective: Although veterans living with HIV infection are burdened with
   smoking-related morbidities, few studies have explored theory-informed,
   evidence-based smoking cessation interventions in the Veterans Affairs
   (VA) Health System.
   Method: In this concurrent mixed-method study, we sought to better
   understand factors influencing the adoption of existing evidence-based
   smoking cessation interventions (reminders, telephone quit lines,
   pharmacological) for veterans in VA HIV clinics. We explored the
   alignment of the revised Promoting Action on Research Implementation in
   Health Services Framework (i-PARIHS) with study results.
   Results: Nineteen clinicians working at eight HIV clinics in the VA
   System participated in the study. Seven themes were identified with
   relative quantitative and qualitative data convergence of clinicians'
   perceptions of the importance of integrating evidence-based smoking
   cessation interventions for veterans with HIV infection.
   Conclusion: Identified themes underscore the need for clinicians to
   provide smoking cessation training, supportive care, and motivate
   veterans living with HIV infection to quit smoking. Integrating smoking
   cessation programs into HIV treatment plans in the veteran patient
   population is critical. Dedicated time to fully implement these efforts
   will maximize smoking cessation intervention efforts and will yield
   successful utilization and subsequent patient compliance. Importantly,
   combination strategies will ensure cessation program impact and
   sustainability.},

Title = {Progress in conducting and reporting behaviour change intervention

Abstract = {Background: ehaviour change is a key to addressing many health and
   healthcare problems and interventions have been designed to improve
   health outcomes. These behaviour change interventions have been
   evaluated in many ways, including randomised controlled trials, and over
   recent decades there has been considerable progress in the conduct and
   reporting these studies. This paper is a personal retrospection on the
   changes occurring that have resulted in our current improved methods and
   their potential for future advancement.
   Advances: There has been steady development of methods for conducting
   trials, including advances in statistical methods enabled by increase
   computing power and programmes, greater attention to the recruitment of
   participants and in the specification of outcomes. Trial reporting has
   improved, largely due to publication of guidelines for reporting
   interventions and trials, but until recently the reporting of behaviour
   change interventions has been quite limited. Developments in the
   specification of active ingredients of these interventions, the
   behaviour change techniques, has transformed our ability to report
   interventions in a manner that facilitates evidence synthesis and
   enables replication and implementation. However, further work using
   ontological approaches is needed to adequately represent the evidence
   contained in the mass of accumulated studies. Meanwhile, attention is
   gradually being paid to the comparator groups in trials leading to
   better reporting but with continuing challenges about how control groups
   are selected.
   Conclusions: These developments are important for the advancements of
   behavioural science - but also in consolidating the expertise needed to
   address global social, environmental and health challenges.},

Abstract = {Oncology nurses are at risk of chronic stress. In this narrative review
   we provide an overview of stress management intervention studies for
   oncology nurses, and suggest that Acceptance and Commitment
   Therapy/Training (ACT) provides a better intervention framework due to
   the relevance of underpinning therapeutic processes (e.g. acceptance,
   mindfulness, values clarification) to the role and stress-related
   experiences of this workforce population. Current evidence for the
   effectiveness of stress management intervention varies, with few studies
   describing how theory informs intervention content, or justifying why
   they should benefit this population specifically. ACT lends itself to
   data-driven intervention development, thus potentially addressing some
   methodological limitations in this field. Only one trial has tested ACT
   in this population, reporting only partial effects. Further empirical
   research is required given (a) the applicability of ACT for this
   population and context, and (b) the associated advantages of brief
   and/or group delivery to address known barriers to participating in
   stress management interventions.},

Title = {A scoping review to ascertain the parameters for an evidence synthesis
   of psychological interventions to improve work and wellbeing outcomes
   among employees with chronic pain},

Abstract = {Background: Psychological interventions have mixed effects on improving
   employee outcomes, partly due to significant variability across studies
   and a lack of focus on mechanisms of action. This scoping review reports
   on the parameters of these interventions and examines intervention
   content to bring clarity to this heterogeneous topic area and direct
   future systematic review work.
   Method: Six databases were searched (Cinahl, Cochrane, Embase, Medline,
   PsychINFO and Web of Science) from April 2010 to August 2020, and a grey
   literature search was undertaken. Screening was undertaken independently
   by two authors. The results summarised country, participant and
   employment characteristics, psychological interventions and work, health
   and wellbeing outcomes. 10\% of the papers were analysed to determine
   the feasibility of coding intervention descriptions for theory and
   behaviour change technique (BCT) components.
   Results: Database searches yielded 9341 titles, of which 91 studies were
   included. Most studies were conducted in Europe (78\%) and included
   males and females (95\%) ranging in age from 31-56.6 years although
   other demographic, and employment information was lacking.
   Musculoskeletal pain was common (87\%). Psychological interventions
   commonly included cognitive behavioural therapy (30\%) and education
   (28\%). Most studies employed a randomised control trial design (64\%).
   Over half contained a control group (54\%). Interventions were delivered
   in mostly healthcare settings (72\%) by health professionals. Multiple
   outcomes were often reported, many of which involved measuring sickness
   absence and return-to-work (62\%) and pain and general health (53\%).
   Within the feasibility analysis, most papers met the minimum criteria of
   containing one paragraph of intervention description, but none
   explicitly mentioned theory or BCTs.
   Conclusion: Psychological interventions for employees with chronic pain
   vary in their nature and implementation. We have shown scoping reviews
   can be used to assess the feasibility of applying tools from health
   psychology to identify the content of these interventions in future
   systematic review work to improve intervention development.},

Abstract = {Background: This paper describes the rationale, intervention
   development, study design and results from the pilot feasibility study
   of the Keep On Running (KOR) trial. KOR aims to test a web-based brief
   theory-based intervention, targeting maintenance of recreational running
   behavior over time (i.e. relapse preventing).
   Methods: Intervention development was based both on Self-Determination
   Theory and on Self-Regulation Theory. As part of it, a pilot study was
   implemented (n=18) to measure intervention adherence and participant
   satisfaction in order to establish the feasibility and acceptability of
   the intervention toolkit. Furthermore, this pilot study was also used to
   test the feasibility and acceptability of the questionnaires selected to
   be part of the later RCT.
   Results: Pilot intervention acceptability was good, but overall
   adherence was low. Features such as feedback and social sharing should
   be added to the toolkit. The main trial should lessen questionnaire
   length and include data from usual monitoring gadgets and apps (APIs).
   The protocol of the RCT was adjusted to test the efficacy of the refined
   final version of the intervention, and the RCT that will test it,
   contributing to the understanding of recreational running
   sustainability, allowing the optimization of future interventions aimed
   at physical activity promotion.},

Abstract = {Objective
   Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is associated with higher rates of
   clinically significant anxiety and depression than in healthy
   populations. Psychosocial interventions targeting anxiety and depression
   in IBD have variable efficacy and disparate treatment approaches, making
   treatment recommendations difficult. The current study aimed to identify
   effective treatment components across psychosocial treatment approaches
   for anxiety and depression in IBD.
   Design
   A systematic review of psychosocial treatments for anxiety and
   depression in IBD was conducted. Based on the Distillation and Matching
   Model, treatments were coded and data aggregated by intervention
   components, or practice elements (PE), to elucidate replicable clinical
   techniques.
   Main Outcome
   The percentage of studies utilizing a given PE was the primary outcome.
   Measures
   Among all included studies, as well as among those finding favorable,
   significant effects on anxiety or depression, the percentage utilizing
   each PE and number of PEs utilized was determined.
   Results
   The most utilized PEs among included interventions were relaxation, IBD
   psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, distraction, and social
   skills. Examining only interventions with favorable differences on
   specified outcomes (HRQoL, Anxiety, Depression, and/or Coping) indicated
   that relaxation, education, cognitive restructuring, and mindfulness
   were most utilized.
   Conclusion
   Implications for clinical practice are discussed, including the
   development and dissemination of treatment recommendations.},

   Evaluation Investigating Theory-Based Mechanisms of Action},

Abstract = {Objective: A randomized trial informed by the Health Action Process
   Approach evaluated interventions to improve cardiac rehabilitation
   completion following myocardial infarction. We investigated indirect
   effects of the interventions on completion via targeted constructs.
   Methods: In this theory-based process evaluation, participants in all 3
   trial arms (usual care; mailouts; mailouts plus telephone support)
   completed a questionnaire 12 months after their myocardial infarction
   assessing intention, goal priority, outcome expectancies, risk
   perception, self-efficacy, social support, action planning, and coping
   planning. Consecutive sampling was used until the target sample size
   (167 per trial arm) was met. Cardiac rehabilitation completion was
   self-reported at the same time point. We used multiple regression
   mediation models to explore indirect effects. Results: In total, 594
   participants completed the cardiac rehabilitation questionnaire; 588
   were analyzed (6 excluded due to missing data). For mailouts alone,
   there were no significant indirect effects. There were small indirect
   effects of mailouts plus telephone support on intention via goal
   priority, outcome expectancies, and self-efficacy, with a negative
   effect via severity risk perception. There were also small indirect
   effects on cardiac rehabilitation completion via self-efficacy and
   action planning. Conclusions: Findings help explain the trial results,
   suggesting that mailouts plus telephone support increased the likelihood
   of completing cardiac rehabilitation by enhancing self-efficacy and
   action planning, and increased intention by enhancing goal priority,
   self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies, with an unintended consequence
   of a negative effect via risk perceptions. Conducting theory-based
   process evaluations alongside trials of behavior change interventions
   can clarify mechanisms of action, which can inform efforts to refine
   interventions and to replicate and generalize findings to other
   jurisdictions.},

Abstract = {Music therapy is increasingly being used as an intervention for stress
   reduction in both medical and mental healthcare settings. Music therapy
   is characterized by personally tailored music interventions initiated by
   a trained and qualified music therapist, which distinguishes music
   therapy from other music interventions, such as `music medicine', which
   concerns mainly music listening interventions offered by healthcare
   professionals. To summarize the growing body of empirical research on
   music therapy, a multilevel meta-analysis, containing 47 studies, 76
   effect sizes and 2.747 participants, was performed to assess the
   strength of the effects of music therapy on both physiological and
   psychological stress-related outcomes, and to test potential moderators
   of the intervention effects. Results showed that music therapy showed an
   overall medium-to-large effect on stress-related outcomes (d = .723,
   {[}.51-.94]). Larger effects were found for clinical controlled trials
   (CCT) compared to randomized controlled trials (RCT), waiting list
   controls instead of care as usual (CAU) or other stress-reducing
   interventions, and for studies conducted in Non-Western countries
   compared to Western countries. Implications for both music therapy and
   future research are discussed.},

Title = {The Implementation Research Logic Model: a method for planning,
   executing, reporting, and synthesizing implementation projects},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {Background Numerous models, frameworks, and theories exist for specific
   aspects of implementation research, including for determinants,
   strategies, and outcomes. However, implementation research projects
   often fail to provide a coherent rationale or justification for how
   these aspects are selected and tested in relation to one another.
   Despite this need to better specify the conceptual linkages between the
   core elements involved in projects, few tools or methods have been
   developed to aid in this task. The Implementation Research Logic Model
   (IRLM) was created for this purpose and to enhance the rigor and
   transparency of describing the often-complex processes of improving the
   adoption of evidence-based interventions in healthcare delivery systems.
   Methods The IRLM structure and guiding principles were developed through
   a series of preliminary activities with multiple investigators
   representing diverse implementation research projects in terms of
   contexts, research designs, and implementation strategies being
   evaluated. The utility of the IRLM was evaluated in the course of a
   2-day training to over 130 implementation researchers and healthcare
   delivery system partners. Results Preliminary work with the IRLM
   produced a core structure and multiple variations for common
   implementation research designs and situations, as well as guiding
   principles and suggestions for use. Results of the survey indicated a
   high utility of the IRLM for multiple purposes, such as improving rigor
   and reproducibility of projects; serving as a ``roadmap{''} for how the
   project is to be carried out; clearly reporting and specifying how the
   project is to be conducted; and understanding the connections between
   determinants, strategies, mechanisms, and outcomes for their project.
   Conclusions The IRLM is a semi-structured, principle-guided tool
   designed to improve the specification, rigor, reproducibility, and
   testable causal pathways involved in implementation research projects.
   The IRLM can also aid implementation researchers and implementation
   partners in the planning and execution of practice change initiatives.
   Adaptation and refinement of the IRLM are ongoing, as is the development
   of resources for use and applications to diverse projects, to address
   the challenges of this complex scientific field.},

Abstract = {Objective To describe the process of developing a cognitive
   rehabilitation intervention for patients with post-stroke cognitive
   impairment (PSCI) and to describe the intervention prior to evaluation
   in a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT).Method:The Medical Research
   Council framework, `Developing and evaluating complex interventions',
   was used to develop the cognitive rehabilitation intervention. We
   conducted a combined analysis of the existing evidence base for PSCI
   rehabilitation alongside qualitative exploration of the perspectives of
   stroke survivors, their families, and healthcare professionals providing
   stroke care, on the necessary components for a cognitive rehabilitation
   intervention for PSCI. The Template for Intervention Description and
   Replication checklist was used as a structural framework for the
   description of the intervention.Results:The intervention comprises a
   five-week intervention integrating group-based activities, supported by
   a clinical neuropsychologist, with home-based activities to encourage
   self-efficacy through the practice of adjustment and compensatory
   strategies learned in the group format to achieve the patients'
   identified goals in managing their PSCI.Conclusion:A cognitive
   rehabilitation intervention for patients with PSCI has been developed
   and described. We are in the process of developing a structured
   intervention manual to standardise the content and delivery of the
   intervention for further testing in a pilot RCT.},

Abstract = {This special issue showcases how investigators working in different
   areas of health behavior change are utilizing early phase studies to
   advance intervention development. Through the publication of design or
   protocol papers for currently funded Science of Behavior Change (SOBC)
   network projects, the special issue illustrates how investigative teams
   are implementing the experimental medicine approach to advance our
   understanding of the mechanisms of action that underlie behavior change
   interventions and, in turn, develop an evidence base that can inform
   future intervention design. Given that a goal of the experimental
   medicine approach is the accumulation of an evidence base regarding the
   links between intervention strategies and putative mechanisms of action,
   it is critical that this evidence base is readily accessible to
   investigators and practitioners. Therefore, each of the included
   articles describes how it is implementing the open-science approach
   within its study protocol to ensure rigor and reproducibility. Each
   article provides information about how to register an early phase
   experiment before study conduct and how to publicly deposit the data,
   metadata, and publications. The special issue includes 10 design and
   protocol articles and 2 commentaries on a diverse array of scientific
   areas and approaches to test mechanisms of action for health behavior
   change interventions. By disseminating how the National Institutes of
   Health SOBC Initiative has supported the conduct of early phase
   intervention studies implementing the experimental medicine and open
   science approaches, the special issue provides a substantive roadmap to
   other scientists for how to adopt these approaches.},

Title = {Open Trial of the Parent Behavior Change Intervention (PBC-I): Study
   Protocol},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {Objective: Parents have profound impacts on adolescents' health
   behaviors. Yet parents receive minimal training in the elements of
   conversations that optimally inspire their children toward engaging in
   healthy behaviors. The current study examines a novel interpersonal
   target: parent-adolescent conversations about adolescent health behavior
   change. Derived from advances in the science of behavior change, the
   Parent Behavior Change Intervention (PBC-I) contains conversational
   elements (e.g., behavior change techniques, positive communication
   strategies) hypothesized to reduce parent-adolescent coercion and
   conflict and facilitate upward spirals of healthy behavior change in
   adolescents. Method/Design: The first phase of the study involves the
   development of the PBC-I in a small case series (N = 12 dyads). The
   second phase involves an open trial of the PBC-I (N = 36 dyads).
   Adolescents will receive six 50-min sessions of the Transdiagnostic
   Sleep and Circadian Intervention to improve sleep while their parents
   receive six50-min sessions of the PBC-I. Parent-adolescent dyads will be
   assessed before and after the intervention. The primary analysis will
   examine whether postintervention use of behavior change techniques and
   positive communication strategies by parents is higher than
   preintervention use and whether increased use by parents predicts more
   positive conversational behaviors, less parent-adolescent conflict,
   higher adolescent motivation for change, and improved adolescent sleep.
   Discussion: This research provides an initial test of the hypothesis
   that improving the parent-adolescent conversation will improve
   adolescent sleep health behavior. While sleep-related health behaviors
   are the focus of this study, the research is designed to be relevant to
   a broad range of health behavior change in young people.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Weight loss maintenance (WLM) is the next major challenge in
   obesity treatment. While most individuals who lose weight intend to keep
   their weight off, weight regain is common. Temporal Self-Regulation
   Theory posits that whether intentions lead to behavior depends on
   self-regulatory capacity, including delay discounting (DD; the tendency
   to discount a larger future reward in favor of a smaller immediate
   reward). Episodic Future Thinking (EFT; mental imagery of a future event
   for which a health goal is important) may improve DD and promote
   behavior change. Described herein is a trial protocol designed to
   examine whether EFT improves DD within the context of weight loss
   maintenance. Method: Participants who lose >= 5\% of initial body weight
   in an online behavioral weight loss intervention will be randomly
   assigned to a standard weight loss maintenance program (WLM-STD) or a
   weight loss maintenance program plus EFT (WLM + EFT). Both interventions
   involve periodic phone and in-person treatment sessions. Participants in
   WLM + EFT will engage in daily EFT training via smartphone. To control
   for contact, participants in WLM-STD will engage in daily Healthy
   Thinking (reviewing strategies for weight management) on their
   smartphone. Our primary hypothesis is that WLM + EFT will yield better
   improvements in DD compared to WLM-STD. We will also explore whether DD
   mediates the relationship between intervention allocation and physical
   activity (secondary outcome). Weight and contextual variables will be
   explored. Conclusions: This study is the first to test whether EFT
   improves DD within the context of weight loss maintenance; results from
   this experimental medicine approach could have important implications
   for understanding the impact of both EFT and DD on sustained behavior
   change.},

Abstract = {Objective: To describe development of the Positive Affect, Promoting
   Positive Engagement, and Adherence for Life (APPEAL) program. Method:
   APPEAL is intended to increase HIV medication adherence through
   promotion of positive affect, and was developed through an iterative
   process involving 6 focus groups (N = 34) that elicited feedback on
   intervention content, followed by an individually administered prepilot
   of the entire intervention (N = 7). Results: Participants provided
   feedback on important potential moderator variables, including
   depression, on mode of intervention administration, and on anticipated
   barriers and benefits to participation. Insights gained were used to
   finalize study procedures in preparation for a feasibility trial. For
   the feasibility trial, a total of 80 participants who, in the past 6
   months have had at least one plasma HIV RNA >200 copies/mL, will be
   randomized to receive APPEAL or standard of care (N = 40 per group).
   Intervention group participants will receive 3 monthly, individually
   administered sessions, and all participants will have their medication
   adherence monitored and complete structured interviews at baseline and
   at 3 and 6 months. Conclusion: The APPEAL program is innovative in that
   it focuses on promoting self-regulation of positive emotions, an
   understudied approach to promoting chronic disease self-management
   behaviors such as HIV medication adherence. Findings from the
   feasibility trial will gauge suitability of the APPEAL intervention and
   evaluation methods for subsequent testing in a confirmatory trial and
   will examine changes in positive affect, the primary mechanism of change
   targeted in the intervention.},

Abstract = {Objective: Due to global urbanization, technological advancements, and
   increasing convenience in daily activities, reduced energy expenditure
   in all aspects of life has become a major public health concern. A
   positive physical activity (PPA) intervention was developed to promote
   physical activity and fitness among Hong Kong families. PPA utilizes
   positive affective attitudes to circumvent barriers to health behavior
   change by helping families associate feelings of enjoyment with physical
   activity. Zero-Time Exercise (ZTEx) was introduced and promoted as a
   foot-in-the-door approach. Method: Using a community-based collaborative
   approach, the research team worked with social service organizations, a
   government department, and schools to implement a cluster randomized
   controlled crossover trial at a citywide scale. A total of 1,983
   eligible participants from 1,467 families were recruited from all 18
   districts in Hong Kong. Data were collected using structured
   questionnaires and physical fitness assessments at preintervention and
   1-month and 3-month follow-up. Results: PPA was effective in increasing
   ZTEx and ZTEx with family members at 1-month and 3-month follow-up and
   in improving balance and endurance at 3-month follow-up. Semistructured
   focus groups provided further support for the intervention effectiveness
   and added in-depth insights into the participants' motivational,
   interpersonal, and affective experiences. Conclusion: The results not
   only shed light on the intervention's effectiveness for physical
   activity and fitness but also demonstrated that the community-based
   collaborative approach was successful in engaging relevant stakeholders
   in an active and fruitful partnership with effective capacity building
   for program development.},

Title = {Towards a comprehensive model for understanding adaptations' impact: the
   model for adaptation design and impact (MADI)},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Background: Implementation science is shifting from qualifying
   adaptations as good or bad towards understanding adaptations and their
   impact. Existing adaptation classification frameworks are largely
   descriptive (e.g., who made the adaptation) and geared towards
   researchers. They do not help practitioners in decision-making around
   adaptations (e.g., is an adaptation likely to have negative impacts?
   Should it be pursued?). Moreover, they lack constructs to consider
   ``ripple effects{''} of adaptations (i.e., both intended and unintended
   impacts on outcomes, recognizing that an adaptation designed to have a
   positive impact on one outcome may have unintended impacts on other
   outcomes). Finally, they do not specify relationships between
   adaptations and outcomes, including mediating and moderating
   relationships. The objective of our research was to promote systematic
   assessment of intended and unintended impacts of adaptations by using
   existing frameworks to create a model that proposes relationships among
   constructs.
   Materials and methods: We reviewed, consolidated, and refined constructs
   from two adaptation frameworks and one intervention-implementation
   outcome framework. Using the consolidated and refined constructs, we
   coded qualitative descriptions of 14 adaptations made to an existing
   evidence-based intervention; the 14 adaptations were designed in prior
   research by a stakeholder panel using a modified Delphi approach. Each
   of the 14 adaptations had detailed descriptions, including the nature of
   the adaptation, who made it, and its goal and reason. Using coded data,
   we arranged constructs from existing frameworks into a model, the Model
   for Adaptation Design and Impact (MADI), that identifies adaptation
   characteristics, their intended and unintended impacts (i.e., ripple
   effects), and potential mediators and moderators of adaptations' impact
   on outcomes. We also developed a decision aid and website
   (MADIguide.org) to help implementation scientists apply MADI in their
   work.
   Results and conclusions: Our model and associated decision aids build on
   existing frameworks by comprehensively characterizing adaptations,
   proposing how adaptations impact outcomes, and offering practical
   guidance for designing adaptations. MADI encourages researchers to think
   about potential causal pathways of adaptations (e.g., mediators and
   moderators) and adaptations' intended and unintended impacts on
   outcomes. MADI encourages practitioners to design adaptations in a way
   that anticipates intended and unintended impacts and leverages best
   practice from research.},

Title = {Establishing cross-systems collaborations for implementation: protocol
   for a longitudinal mixed methods study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Background: Cross-system interventions can help integrate services
   across different service delivery systems but require organizations to
   establish strong collaborative relationships for implementation.
   Contingency theory suggests that the effectiveness of different
   collaborative strategies (i.e. specific ways organizations align
   operations and services) varies by context. This paper describes a study
   of different strategies for fostering collaboration between child
   welfare and substance abuse treatment agencies and the conditions under
   which they are effective for implementation. We also describe the
   development and piloting of the Collaborating Across Systems for Program
   Implementation (CASPI) tool-a decision-making guide intended to help
   researchers and organizational leaders identify and use appropriate
   collaborative strategies for their context.
   Methods/design: This multisite longitudinal, mixed methods study,
   leverages a naturally occurring implementation initiative - in up to 17
   Ohio counties - to implement Ohio START (Sobriety Treatment and Reducing
   Trauma). START is a child welfare model that requires strong
   collaboration with local substance use treatment organizations to
   promote integrated services. During the first two years, we will
   identify collaborative strategies associated with improved START
   implementation (penetration and fidelity) and service delivery outcomes
   (timeliness), given system, and organizational features. We will conduct
   a convergent mixed methods study drawing on worker surveys, agency
   documents, administrative data, formal partner agreements, and group
   interviews. Data will be integrated and analyzed using Qualitative
   Comparative Analysis (QCA). To develop the CASPI, an expert panel
   comprised of implementation experts, and community stakeholders will
   convene to synthesize our findings and develop contents (including a
   decision tree). During the final year of the study, we will assess the
   acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the CASPI in a
   randomized vignette experiment, and a pilot-test with 3 child welfare
   agencies that have not yet implemented START.
   Discussion: Our results will lay the groundwork for a larger controlled
   trial that will test the CASPI's effectiveness for supporting effective
   and efficient implementation of cross-system interventions like START.
   The CASPI is expected to help leaders and researchers select and use
   collaboration strategies tailored to their context and be applicable in
   a wide range of settings including rural communities. Our work also
   advances system-level implementation strategies.},

Abstract = {Objective:To identify the behaviour change techniques and intervention
   components associated with the promotion of physical activity (PA) for
   children and young people living with and beyond cancer.Design and main
   outcome measures:A systematic review and narrative synthesis was
   conducted on the evidence on PA interventions for children and young
   people (up to 30 years of age) living with and beyond cancer using a
   social ecological framework.Results:Out of 12 studies, 8 were shown to
   change PA. Intervention components included (1) behavioural (Instruction
   on how to perform the behaviour, credible source, behavioural
   demonstration and rehearsal), (2) cognitive-emotional (targeting
   attitude, perceived behavioural control, intentions, resilience and
   achievement) (3) socio-cultural (family and peer support for PA), (4)
   environmental (providing access to resources, environmental
   restructuring, safety), (5) demographic (child, adolescent, young adult
   or mixed) and (6) medical (tailored exercise depending on age and cancer
   stage).Conclusions:Interventions designed to increase physical activity
   participation and adherence during and beyond cancer treatment for young
   people should integrate psychosocial (behavioural, cognitive-emotional,
   social), environmental and medical intervention components. Our
   conceptual model can be used to inform the development of interventions
   and guides future research objectives and priorities.},

Abstract = {Objective: Compassion-based interventions show promise in enhancing
   well-being and reducing distress, but little is known about their
   applications for people with long-term physical conditions. This study
   explores compassion-based interventions for this population: what are
   their differing elements (content, structure, tailoring, use of
   technology), feasibility and acceptability, effects and experienced
   benefits? Design: A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted. Four
   bibliographic databases were searched without study design restrictions.
   Meta-synthesis was used to integrate quantitative results of effects and
   qualitative results of experienced benefits. Results: Twenty studies met
   the inclusion criteria. Most studies targeted people with cancer or
   persistent pain. Interventions were either comprehensive with 6-12
   face-to-face sessions, or brief based on a single compassion exercise.
   Feasibility and accessibility were highly rated by participants. Amongst
   a plethora of outcomes, reductions in depression and anxiety were the
   most common findings. Our qualitative synthesis yielded experienced
   benefits of (1) acceptance of the condition; (2) improved emotion
   regulation skills; (3) reduced feelings of isolation. There was minimal
   overlap between quantitative and qualitative outcomes. Conclusion: While
   the field is still in its infancy, this review highlights the potential
   benefits of compassion-based interventions for people with long-term
   physical conditions and discusses recommendations for further
   intervention research and development.},

Abstract = {Physical inactivity is a key risk factor for non-communicable diseases,
   and there is a need for interventions to increase the adoption and
   maintenance of regular physical activity. Interventions based on
   Acceptance and Commitment (ACT) have shown promise for promoting a range
   of health behaviours, including physical activity. The aims of this
   review were to (1) determine the effectiveness of ACT interventions for
   physical activity; and (2) identify the ACT processes, behaviour change
   techniques (BCTs) and intervention characteristics associated with ACT
   interventions. Eight electronic databases were searched for ACT
   interventions that aimed to increase physical activity. Seven eligible
   studies were included in the systematic review, and ACT processes,
   Behaviour Change Techniques and other intervention components and
   characteristics of the included interventions were coded. Six studies
   were randomised controlled trials that were included in a random-effects
   meta-analysis, which indicated small-to-moderate effects on physical
   activity (SMD = 0.32, 95\% CI (0.07, 0.57), p = 0.01). ACT interventions
   show promise for increasing physical activity, but very few of the
   `active ingredients' of ACT interventions could be characterised as
   BCTs. Future development of ACT interventions for physical activity
   should attempt to describe and name the ACT processes targeted by the
   intervention, and the BCTs used to target those processes},

Title = {An Ecological Momentary Episodic Future Thinking Intervention on
   Mother's Weekly Food Purchases},

Abstract = {Background: Imagining one's own future (episodic future thinking, EFT)
   has helped mothers with overweight purchase healthier groceries during
   an online shopping task in the laboratory. The present study explored
   whether delivering an EFT intervention to participants' devices via an
   ecological momentary intervention (EMI) tool would help mothers purchase
   healthier food at brick-and-mortar stores. Method: Participants (N = 43,
   mothers 31-52 years of age, BMI >= 24.9 kg/m(2)) were randomized to EFT
   or standardized episodic thinking (SET). EFT cues include a positive and
   vivid description of future events while SET cues focus on the recent
   experience of playing games in the laboratory. Cues were uploaded to
   participant profiles on an EMI site. Participants were trained on how to
   read and listen to cues as well as how to detail purchases. Participants
   received text reminders to listen to cues before shopping and returned
   with receipts the following day. Receipt data was analyzed to derive
   dependent variables, calories, and nutrients purchased per person.
   Correlations were used to analyze associations between study variables
   of interest, and ANOVAs were conducted to compare dietary variables by
   group. Results: Participants in the EFT group purchased fewer calories,
   fewer grams of fat, fewer grams of saturated fat, and fewer miligrams of
   sodium than participants in the SET control group. Conclusion:
   Delivering EFT cues to participant devices may be a promising way to
   improve the calorie and nutrient content of food purchases. Future
   research should include a longer follow-up and analyze calorie changes
   over time.},

Abstract = {Self-regulation (SR), or the ability to manage thoughts, emotions, and
   behaviours in order to achieve a desired goal, is seen as underlying
   positive health behaviours. In adults, behaviour change techniques
   (BCTs) are recommended to promote SR across health domains; although
   establishing healthy habits early in life is important, studies of SR
   and health in children are rare. This conceptual review provides
   guidance on developmental considerations for applying BCTs to enhance SR
   capacity in children and youth with the goal of fostering positive
   behavioural health trajectories early in the lifespan. Key
   considerations include the nature of developmental changes in SR and
   interaction among SR processes; temporal associations between SR and
   health behaviours; and relevance of health goals for children and youth.
   Building on a meta-review of BCT's used to promote SR in adults and
   youth, this conceptual review highlights key SR milestones to consider
   in behaviour change-focused interventions from early childhood through
   adolescence and provides an overview of social-ecologic influences on SR
   development and associations between SR and health behaviours across
   these age periods. Implications for and examples of using
   developmentally-informed BCTs in interventions to enhance SR in children
   and youth are noted and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

Title = {The sustainability of public health interventions in schools: a
   systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {Background The sustainability of school-based health interventions after
   external funds and/or other resources end has been relatively unexplored
   in comparison to health care. If effective interventions discontinue,
   new practices cannot reach wider student populations and investment in
   implementation is wasted. This review asked: What evidence exists about
   the sustainability of school-based public health interventions? Do
   schools sustain public health interventions once start-up funds end?
   What are the barriers and facilitators affecting the sustainability of
   public health interventions in schools in high-income countries? Methods
   Seven bibliographic databases and 15 websites were searched. References
   and citations of included studies were searched, and experts and authors
   were contacted to identify relevant studies. We included reports
   published from 1996 onwards. References were screened on title/abstract,
   and those included were screened on full report. We conducted data
   extraction and appraisal using an existing tool. Extracted data were
   qualitatively synthesised for common themes, using May's General Theory
   of Implementation (2013) as a conceptual framework. Results Of the 9677
   unique references identified through database searching and other search
   strategies, 24 studies of 18 interventions were included in the review.
   No interventions were sustained in their entirety; all had some
   components that were sustained by some schools or staff, bar one that
   was completely discontinued. No discernible relationship was found
   between evidence of effectiveness and sustainability. Key facilitators
   included commitment/support from senior leaders, staff observing a
   positive impact on students' engagement and wellbeing, and staff
   confidence in delivering health promotion and belief in its value.
   Important contextual barriers emerged: the norm of prioritising
   educational outcomes under time and resource constraints, insufficient
   funding/resources, staff turnover and a lack of ongoing training.
   Adaptation of the intervention to existing routines and changing
   contexts appeared to be part of the sustainability process. Conclusions
   Existing evidence suggests that sustainability depends upon schools
   developing and retaining senior leaders and staff that are
   knowledgeable, skilled and motivated to continue delivering health
   promotion through ever-changing circumstances. Evidence of effectiveness
   did not appear to be an influential factor. However, methodologically
   stronger primary research, informed by theory, is needed.},

Abstract = {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses play an important role in
   summarising current research on the efficacy of behaviour change
   interventions and their mechanisms of action. The reviews in this
   special issue represent a `step change' in evaluating current evidence
   on behaviour change interventions and mechanisms. This article outlines
   the findings and emerging issues identified in the reviews ('known
   knowns'), and summarises evidence gaps to be addressed in future
   research ('known unknowns'). Findings indicate that tests of mechanisms
   of behaviour change interventions are not routinely conducted in primary
   studies and research syntheses; reviews and studies do not sufficiently
   account for study quality; substantive variability exists in
   descriptions of intervention content and putative mediators implicated
   in their mechanisms of action; limited data is available on the efficacy
   of many behaviour change techniques; and moderators of intervention
   effects and mechanisms are seldom taken into account. Possible solutions
   include testing effects of isolated behaviour change techniques and
   mechanisms of action; routine evaluation of study quality in behavioural
   intervention research; development of an evidence base linking behaviour
   change techniques with theory-based constructs that comprise mechanisms
   of action; adoption of fit-for-purpose methods for synthesising
   behavioural intervention mechanisms of action; and routine testing of
   moderators in intervention research.},

Abstract = {BackgroundDepression is a common health problem during adolescence and
   is associated with adverse academic, social and health outcomes. To meet
   the demand for treatment for adolescent depression, there is a need for
   evidence-based interventions suitable for delivery outside of specialist
   Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Interpersonal
   Counselling for Adolescents (IPC-A) is a brief manualised intervention
   for adolescent depression suitable for delivery by staff who are not
   qualified health professionals following participation in a brief
   training course. While initial piloting within Local Authority services
   has generated promising results, the effectiveness and
   cost-effectiveness of IPC-A has yet to be established. This study aims
   to assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT),
   evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IPC-A delivered
   by staff without core professional training in comparison to current
   provision.MethodFeasibility RCT with process evaluation using
   ethnographic methodology. Eligible young people (n = 60) will be
   randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either IPC-A or treatment as usual
   (TAU). Participants will be assessed pre-randomisation (baseline) and
   followed up at 5, 10 and 23weeks post-randomisation. A parallel process
   evaluation will generate understanding of intervention implementation
   across services and explore the acceptability of the intervention from
   the perspective of young people and other key
   stakeholders.ParticipantsYoung people aged 12-18years presenting to
   non-specialist services with symptoms of depression. Youth workers,
   young people and stakeholders will participate in the process
   evaluation.DiscussionThe need for effective and accessible interventions
   for young people with mild/sub-threshold depression who, in most cases,
   do not meet the threshold for mainstream mental health services is long
   overdue. The primary output of this feasibility trial will be the design
   of the subsequent full-scale trial. If the results of the current study
   indicate that this would be feasible, we intend to progress to a
   multi-site, assessor-blind, superiority RCT of the effectiveness and
   cost-effectiveness of IPC-A in comparison to TAU for adolescents
   presenting to non-specialist services with depressive symptoms. If
   satisfactory solutions to any problems encountered cannot be identified,
   alternative research designs will be considered. If proven effective, an
   IPC-A training programme could be implemented.Trial registryISRCTN

Title = {Evaluation of a manualised speech and language therapy programme for

Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {BackgroundChildren with Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SPCD)
   have long-term needs in using and processing social language and have a
   high risk of later mental health difficulties. A manualised speech and
   language therapy programme, the Social Communication Intervention
   Programme (SCIP) provides therapy content for SPCD. A feasibility study
   is required to derive more precise estimates of key parameters for a
   future trial of SCIP.AimsTo assess the feasibility of conducting a
   substantive randomized controlled trial of SCIP for children with
   SPCD.MethodsA questionnaire was distributed to paediatric speech and
   language therapists in England. Survey questions addressed number of
   eligible children, routine intervention provision and trial recruitment
   factors. In the second phase, a single-arm intervention feasibility
   study was completed. Fifteen speech and language practitioners
   identified 24 children aged 5-11years with SPCD. Practitioners received
   training/supervision to deliver 20 SCIP therapy sessions to each child.
   At time 1, parents of participating children provided three
   communication goals; expected steps in each goal were defined. After
   intervention, parents and practitioners independently rated each goal
   compared to baseline ability. Two research practitioners compared parent
   post-intervention commentaries with outcome scores to derive guidance
   about clinical significance. All practitioners recorded audio
   commentaries on therapy experiences. Post-intervention interviews were
   conducted with 6 practitioners and 6 parents. An expert panel completed
   a Delphi consultation on trial design.ResultsRoutine practice for SPCD
   varies widely. Children tend to be embedded in autism provision.
   Participation in a future trial was well supported provided resources
   are available to services. Outcomes analysis indicated all children
   except one made some progress on parent ratings; all children made
   progress on practitioner ratings. A power analysis for a future trial
   was carried out using current outcome measure as putative primary
   endpoint. Practitioners' audio-diaries provided suggestions for training
   and adaption in a future trial. Outcomes and therapy methods were
   acceptable to practitioners and parents.ConclusionsThe feasibility study
   evaluated a novel outcome measure of social communication skills in
   SPCD. A power calculation indicated a feasible framework for a trial
   within a realistic period of time. Recommendations for recruitment
   methods, adaptation of manual and training were supported by
   practitioners and an expert panel.Trial registrationTitle:

Title = {Designing integrated interventions to improve nutrition and WASH
   behaviors in Kenya},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {BackgroundChild stunting, an indicator of chronic malnutrition, is a
   global public health problem. Malnutrition during pregnancy and the
   first 2 years of life undermines the survival, growth, and development
   of children. Exposure to fecal pathogens vis-a-vis inadequate water,
   sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) has been implicated in the etiology of
   child stunting, highlighting the need to integrate WASH with
   nutrition-sensitive interventions to comprehensively address this
   complex problem. The aim of this study was to describe a systematic,
   theoretically informed approach (that drew from the Starr and Fornoff
   approach to the Theory of Change development and the Behavior Change
   Wheel approach) to design a multi-component and integrated social and
   behavior change intervention to improve WASH and nutrition-related
   behaviors in western Kenya.MethodsThis intervention was developed to be
   integrated into an existing project that utilized the care group model
   and aimed to create a culture of care and support for HIV/AIDS-affected
   children under two and their caregivers and was executed by local
   partners. We tested the newly created intervention packages in
   user-testing trials using an adapted Trials of Improved Practices
   approach to pilot acceptability and feasibility.ResultsUsing authentic
   stakeholder engagement and relevant theories, we conducted an 8-step
   process: (1) conduct mixed methods formative research, (2) prioritize
   target behaviors, (3) use causal analysis to create problem trees, (4)
   develop solution trees and articulate assumptions and rationales for
   change, (5) link solution trees to intervention functions, (6) develop
   the intervention plan, (7) create the intervention packages, and (8)
   test and refine the intervention packages.ConclusionsThis study
   highlights the need to take a multi-sectorial, integrated approach that
   integrates contextually relevant behavior change theories with the
   experiential knowledge gleaned from stakeholders into the design of
   interventions that seek to reduce child stunting. This process resulted
   in the creation of intervention packages that grouped behaviors
   thematically to be most relevant and responsive to the population
   context. This work has the potential to make important contributions
   towards achievement of the United Nations' sustainable development
   goals.},

Abstract = {BackgroundAs dietary behaviours developed during early childhood are
   known to track into adulthood, interventions that aim to improve child
   nutrition at a population level are recommended. Whilst early childhood
   education and care (ECEC) is a promising setting for interventions
   targeting children's nutrition behaviours, previous interventions have
   largely used high intensity, face-to-face approaches, limiting their
   reach, implementation and potential impact at a population level.
   Web-based modalities represent a promising means of supporting the
   delivery of childcare-based interventions whilst overcoming challenges
   of previous approaches; however, the feasibility of using such
   modalities to support implementation is largely unknown. As such, this
   study sought to collect feasibility and pilot data to inform the design
   of a web-based intervention together with health promotion officer
   support within childcare centres. Child dietary intake will also be
   assessed to provide an estimate of the impact of the implementation
   intervention.MethodsA superiority cluster randomised controlled trial
   with repeat cross-sectional data collection employing an
   effectiveness-implementation type-II hybrid design will be conducted
   with childcare centres within the Hunter New England region of New South
   Wales, Australia. Type-II hybrid designs provide the opportunity to
   assess intervention efficacy whilst piloting the feasibility of the
   implementation strategies. Centres allocated to the intervention group
   will receive access to a web-based program together with health
   promotion officer support to implement targeted healthy eating practices
   to improve child diet in care. A number of outcomes will be assessed to
   inform the feasibility to conduct a larger trial, including childcare
   centre and parent recruitment and consent rates for each component of
   data collection, uptake of the implementation strategies, acceptability
   of the intervention and implementation strategies, appropriateness of
   the implementation strategies and the contextual factors influencing
   implementation.DiscussionThis study will provide high-quality evidence
   regarding the potential feasibility of a web-based intervention and the
   impact of healthy eating practices on child diet in care. Web-based
   modalities provide a promising approach for population-wide
   implementation support to childcare centres given their potential reach
   and consistency with existing infrastructure.Trial

Title = {Results from a pre-post, uncontrolled pilot study of a mindfulness-based
   program for early elementary school teachers},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {BackgroundMindfulness-based programs are a novel and promising approach
   for supporting teachers' occupational health and well-being. Although
   rationales for mindfulness programs for teachers have been offered, the
   empirical research base evaluating approaches for educating teachers in
   mindfulness is still developing. This study reports the findings of a
   pilot study of a mindfulness-based program. This study is unique in that
   it is one of the only studies of the Mindfulness-Based Emotional Balance
   (MBEB) program to focus on early elementary teachers, to be implemented
   by a new instructor, and to recruit teachers via extrinsic
   motivators.MethodsA pre-post, uncontrolled pilot study of a 27.5-h
   mindfulness-based program for teachers was conducted with 21
   pre-kindergarten-third-grade teachers from the Pacific Northwest of the
   USA. Program acceptability was assessed based on attendance and teacher
   reports of program benefits. Effect sizes for within-person changes
   (from pre- to post-program) in teachers' skills and mindsets,
   well-being, occupational health, and teaching practices were calculated.
   Teachers also suggested improvements to the program.ResultsWith regard
   to program attendance and acceptability, teachers attended 87\% of
   sessions, with 58\% of teachers reporting a personal benefit and 58\% of
   teachers reporting a professional benefit of the program. Effect sizes
   for changes in teachers' skills and mindsets ranged from small to large,
   |d| = 0.30 to 0.83, and ranged from small to medium for changes in
   teachers' well-being |d| = 0.07 to 0.48, occupational health |d| = 0.14
   to 0.39, and teaching practices |d| = 0.15 to 0.48. Teachers suggested
   shortening the program and linking it more closely to their work in the
   classroom.ConclusionsThis study suggests that the MBEB program may be
   beneficial to early elementary teachers, even when implemented by
   someone other than the program developer, and when provided with
   extrinsic motivation to participate (more closely mapping to a
   larger-scale trial of the program). Teachers' suggestions regarding
   program length and structure are considered, along with useful avenues
   for future research on mindfulness-based programs for teachers.},

Title = {The feasibility of a Comprehensive Resilience-building psychosocial

Abstract = {BackgroundA dementia diagnosis can prevent people from participating in
   society, leading to a further decline in cognitive, social and physical
   health. However, it may be possible for people with dementia to continue
   to live meaningful lives and continue to participate actively in society
   if a supportive psychosocial environment exists. Resilience theory,
   which focuses on strengthening personal attributes and external assets
   in the face of serious challenges, may provide a scaffold on which an
   inclusive multifaceted psychosocial supportive environment can be built.
   This protocol paper describes a study to determine the feasibility of
   conducting a multifaceted complex resilience building psychosocial
   intervention for people with dementia and their caregivers living in the
   community.MethodsThis is a non-randomised feasibility study. Ten
   participants with dementia and their primary caregivers living in the
   community will be recruited and receive the CREST intervention. The
   intervention provides (a) a 7-week cognitive stimulation programme
   followed by an 8-week physical exercise programme for people with
   dementia and (b) a 6-week educational programme for caregivers. Members
   of the wider community will be invited to a dementia awareness programme
   and GP practices to a dementia training workshop. Trained professionals
   will deliver all intervention components. Outcomes will assess the
   feasibility and acceptability of all study processes. The feasibility
   and acceptability of a range of outcomes to be collected in a future
   definitive trial, including economic measurements, will also be
   explored. Finally, social marketing will be used to map a route toward
   stigma change in dementia for use in a subsequent trial. Quantitative
   feasibility outcome assessments will be completed at baseline and after
   completion of the 15-week intervention while qualitative data will be
   collected at recruitment, baseline, during and post-intervention
   delivery.ConclusionThis feasibility study will provide evidence
   regarding the feasibility and acceptability of a comprehensive
   multifaceted psychosocial intervention programme for people with
   dementia and their caregivers (CREST). The results will be used to
   inform the development and implementation of a subsequent RCT, should
   the findings support feasibility.Trial registrationISRCTN25294519

Abstract = {BackgroundChildren with intellectual disability have an IQ < 70,
   associated deficits in adaptive skills and are at increased risk of
   having clinically concerning levels of behaviour problems. In addition,
   parents of children with intellectual disability are likely to report
   high levels of mental health and other psychological problems. The Early
   Positive Approaches to Support (E-PAtS) programme for family caregivers
   of young children (5years and under) with intellectual and developmental
   disabilities is a group-based intervention which aims to enhance
   parental psychosocial wellbeing and service access and support positive
   development for children. The aim of this study is to assess the
   feasibility of delivering E-PAtS to family caregivers of children with
   intellectual disability by community parenting support service provider
   organisations. The study will inform a potential, definitive RCT of the
   effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of E-PAtS.MethodsThis study is a
   feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial, with embedded process
   evaluation. Up to 2 family caregivers will be recruited from 64 families
   with a child (18months to 5years) with intellectual disability at
   research sites in the UK. Participating families will be allocated to
   intervention: control on a 1:1 basis; intervention families will be
   offered the E-PAtS programme immediately, continuing to receive usual
   practice, and control participants will be offered the opportunity to
   attend the E-PAtS programme at the end of the follow-up period and will
   continue to receive usual practice. Data will be collected at baseline,
   3months post-randomisation and 12months post-randomisation. The primary
   aim is to assess feasibility via the assessment of: recruitment of
   service provider organisations; participant recruitment; randomisation;
   retention; intervention adherence; intervention fidelity and the views
   of participants, intervention facilitators and service provider
   organisations regarding intervention delivery and study processes. The
   secondary aim is preliminary evaluation of a range of established
   outcome measures for individual family members, subsystem relationships
   and overall family functioning, plus additional health economic outcomes
   for inclusion in a future definitive trial.DiscussionThe results of this
   study will inform a potential future definitive trial, to evaluate the
   effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the E-PAtS intervention to
   improve parental psychosocial wellbeing. Such a trial would have
   significant scientific impact internationally in the intellectual
   disability field.Trial registrationISRCTN70419473},

Title = {Implementing nudges for suicide prevention in real-world environments:
   project INSPIRE study protocol},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Background: Suicide is a global health issue. There are a number of
   evidence-based practices for suicide screening, assessment, and
   intervention that are not routinely deployed in usual care settings. The
   goal of this study is to develop and test implementation strategies to
   facilitate evidence-based suicide screening, assessment, and
   intervention in two settings where individuals at risk for suicide are
   especially likely to present: primary care and specialty mental health
   care. We will leverage methods from behavioral economics, which involves
   understanding the many factors that influence human decision making, to
   inform strategy development.
   Methods: We will identify key mechanisms that limit implementation of
   evidence-based suicide screening, assessment, and intervention practices
   in primary care and specialty mental health through contextual inquiry
   involving behavioral health and primary care clinicians. Second, we will
   use contextual inquiry results to systematically design a menu of
   behavioral economics-informed implementation strategies that cut across
   settings, in collaboration with an advisory board composed of key
   stakeholders (i.e., behavioral economists, clinicians, implementation
   scientists, and suicide prevention experts). Finally, we will conduct
   rapid-cycle trials to test and refine the menu of implementation
   strategies. Primary outcomes include clinician-reported feasibility and
   acceptability of the implementation strategies.
   Discussion: Findings will elucidate ways to address common and unique
   barriers to evidence-based suicide screening, assessment, and
   intervention practices in primary care and specialty mental health care.
   Results will yield refined, pragmatically tested strategies that can
   inform larger confirmatory trials to combat the growing public health
   crisis of suicide.},

Title = {The impact of summer programming on the obesogenic behaviors of
   children: behavioral outcomes from a quasi-experimental pilot trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {BackgroundChildren from low-income families experience accelerated BMI
   gain and learning loss during summer. Healthy Summer Learners (HSL)
   addresses accelerated BMI gain and academic learning loss during summer
   by providing academic- and health-focused programming. This manuscript
   reports the effects of HSL on underlying obesogenic behaviors (i.e.,
   physical activity, screen time, sleep, diet) that lead to accelerated
   summer BMI gain, a necessary first step to informing a future randomized
   controlled trial of HSL.MethodsIn the summer of 2018 and 2019 using a
   quasi-experimental study design, 180 children (90 per summer, 7.9years
   {[}SD = 1.0], 94\% non-Hispanic Black, 40\% male) at two schools (i.e.,
   one per summer) who were struggling academically (25-75\% on a
   standardized reading test) were provided a free, school-based 6-week
   health- and academic-focused summer program (i.e., HSL, n = 60), a 4- to
   6-week academic-focused summer program (i.e., 21st Century Summer
   Learning program (21C), n = 60), or no summer program (n = 60). Children
   wore the Fitbit Charge 2 (TM) over a 10-week period during the summers
   (June-Aug) of 2018-2019. Differences within (within child days attend
   vs. not attend) and between (differences between groups attend vs. not
   attend) were evaluated using mixed effects linear
   regression.ResultsRegression estimates indicated that, on days
   attending, HSL children experienced a greater reduction in sedentary
   minutes (- 58.6 {[}95\% CI = - 92.7, - 24.4]) and a greater increase in
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (36.2 {[}95\% CI = 25.1,
   47.3]) and steps (2799.2 {[}95\% CI = 2114.2, 3484.2]) compared to 21C
   children. However, both HSL and 21C children were more active (i.e.,
   greater MVPA, total steps) and less sedentary (i.e., less sedentary
   minutes and total screen time) and displayed better sleeping patterns
   (i.e., earlier and less variability in sleep onset and offset) on days
   they attended than children in the control.ConclusionsHSL produced
   greater changes in physical activity than 21C. However, attendance at
   either HSL or 21C leads to more healthy obesogenic behaviors. Based on
   the behavioral data in this pilot study, a larger trial may be
   warranted. These results must be considered along with the pending
   primary outcomes (i.e., academics and BMI z-score) of the HSL pilot to
   determine if a full-scale trial is warranted.Trial

Title = {Study protocol for POSITIF, a randomised multicentre feasibility trial

Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {BackgroundApproximately, half of stroke survivors experience fatigue.
   Fatigue may persist for many months and interferes with participation in
   everyday activities and has a negative impact on social and family
   relationships, return to work, and quality of life. Fatigue is among the
   top 10 priorities for `Life after Stroke' research for stroke survivors,
   carers, and clinicians. We previously developed and tested in a small
   uncontrolled pilot study a manualised, clinical psychologist-delivered,
   face-to-face intervention, informed by cognitive behavioural therapy
   (CBT). We then adapted it for delivery by trained therapists via
   telephone. We now aim to test the feasibility of this approach in a
   parallel group, randomised controlled feasibility trial (Post Stroke
   Intervention Trial In Fatigue, POSITIF).Methods/designPOSITIF aims to
   recruit 75 stroke survivors between 3months and 2years post-stroke who
   would like treatment for their fatigue. Eligible consenting stroke
   survivors will be randomised to either a 7-session manualised
   telephone-delivered intervention based on CBT principles plus
   information about fatigue, or information only. The aims of the
   intervention are to (i) provide an explanation for post-stroke fatigue,
   in particular that it is potentially reversible (an educational
   approach), (ii) encourage participants to overcome the fear of taking
   physical activity and challenge negative thinking (a cognitive approach)
   and (iii) promote a balance between daily activities, rest and sleep and
   then gradually increase levels of physical activity (a behavioural
   approach). Fatigue, mood, quality of life, return to work and putative
   mediators will be assessed at baseline (just before randomisation), at
   the end of treatment and 6 months after randomisation. POSITIF will
   determine the feasibility of recruitment, adherence to the intervention
   and the resources required to deliver the intervention in a larger
   trial.DiscussionThe POSITIF feasibility trial will recruit until 31
   January 2020. Data will inform the utility and design of a future
   adequately powered randomised controlled trial.Trial

Title = {A co-production approach guided by the behaviour change wheel to develop
   an intervention for reducing sedentary behaviour after stroke},

Abstract = {BackgroundStroke survivors are highly sedentary; thus, breaking up long
   uninterrupted bouts of sedentary behaviour could have substantial health
   benefit. However, there are no intervention strategies specifically
   aimed at reducing sedentary behaviour tailored for stroke survivors. The
   purpose of this study was to use co-production approaches to develop an
   intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour after stroke.MethodsA series
   of five co-production workshops with stroke survivors, their caregivers,
   stroke service staff, exercise professionals, and researchers were
   conducted in parallel in two-stroke services (England and Scotland).
   Workshop format was informed by the behaviour change wheel (BCW)
   framework for developing interventions and incorporated systematic
   review and empirical evidence. Taking an iterative approach, data from
   activities and audio recordings were analysed following each workshop
   and findings used to inform subsequent workshops, to inform both the
   activities of the next workshop and ongoing intervention
   development.FindingsCo-production workshop participants (n = 43)
   included 17 staff, 14 stroke survivors, six caregivers and six
   researchers. The target behaviour for stroke survivors is to increase
   standing and moving, and the target behaviour for caregivers and staff
   is to support and encourage stroke survivors to increase standing and
   moving. The developed intervention is primarily based on co-produced
   solutions to barriers to achieving the target behaviour. The developed
   intervention includes 34 behaviour change techniques. The intervention
   is to be delivered through stroke services, commencing in the inpatient
   setting and following through discharge into the community. Participants
   reported that taking part in intervention development was a positive
   experience.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study that has
   combined the use of co-production and the BCW to develop an intervention
   for use in stroke care. In-depth reporting of how a co-production
   approach was combined with the BCW framework, including the design of
   bespoke materials for workshop activities, should prove useful to other
   researchers and practitioners involved in intervention development in
   stroke.},

Title = {Changing activity behaviours in vocational school students: the stepwise

Abstract = {Background:School-based interventions that increase physical activity
   (PA) in a sustainable way are lacking. Systematic and participatory,
   theory and evidence-based intervention development may enhance the
   effectiveness of complex behavioural interventions in the long term.
   However, detailed descriptions of the intervention development process
   are rarely openly published, hindering transparency and progress in the
   field.
   Aims:To illustrate a stepwise process to develop intervention targeting
   PA and sedentary behaviour (SB) among older adolescents, and to describe
   the final, optimised version of the intervention, detailing content of
   sessions by theoretical determinants and techniques. Methods:Two
   established intervention development frameworks (Intervention Mapping
   and Behaviour Change Wheel) were integrated, leading to a comprehensive
   evidence and theory-based process. It was informed by empirical studies,
   literature reviews, expert and stakeholder consultation, including
   scenario evaluation and component pre-testing. In all steps, contextual
   fit and potential for sustainability were ensured by stakeholder
   engagement.
   Results:As a large majority of youth opposed decreasing screen time,
   increasing PA and decreasing SB were defined as target behaviours, with
   peers and the school context including classroom practices as key social
   environments in influencing youth PA (problem specification, step 1).
   Behavioural diagnosis (step 2) identified a variety of determinants in
   the domains of capability (e.g. self-regulation skills), motivation
   (e.g. outcome expectations) and environmental opportunities. These were
   organised into an intervention theory integrating several formal
   theories, including Self-Determination Theory. Theory-aligned principles
   guided material design (Step 3). Feasibility RCT allowed optimisation
   into a final intervention protocol (step 4).
   Conclusions:Intervention elements target students directly, and
   indirectly by changing teacher behaviour and the school and wider
   environment. A systematic development and optimisation led to a high
   potential for sustainability. The detailed intervention content, with
   specification of the hypothesised mechanisms, allows for other
   researchers to replicate, adapt or refine parts or the whole
   intervention, considering specific target groups and (sub-)cultures.},

   groups of healthy infants (N = 35, baseline mean (SD) age 5.9 (2.8)
   weeks) and their mothers attending local mother's groups (Australia)
   were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. The
   intervention group received group tummy time classes in addition to
   usual care. The control group received usual care with their child and
   family health nurse. Primary outcomes were intervention feasibility and
   acceptability. Secondary outcomes were tummy time duration
   (accelerometry), adherence to physical activity guidelines, head shape,
   and motor development. Measures were taken at baseline,
   post-intervention, and when infants were 6months of age. Analyses were
   by linear mixed models and Cohen's d statistic.ResultsRecruitment,
   retention, and collection of objective data met feasibility targets.
   Acceptability was also met with intervention mothers reporting the
   information, goal planning, and handouts significantly more useful and
   relevant than control group mothers (p < 0.01). Moderate effect sizes
   were also found at post-intervention for tummy time duration, adherence
   to physical activity guidelines and infant ability in prone and supine
   favoring the intervention group (intervention infants had a mean of
   30min and 30\% adherence to guidelines (95\% CI 0 to 60.6min) compared
   to the control infants who had a mean of 16.6min and 13\% adherence to
   the guidelines (95\% CI 0 to 42.1min, Cohen's d = 0.5). Limitations were
   the small sample size, 4-week intervention, limited accelerometer use,
   and a homogenous sample of participants.ConclusionGroup tummy time
   classes delivered in a mother's group setting were shown to be feasible
   and acceptable. A larger randomized controlled trial is warranted.Trial

Title = {Bedtime Routines Intervention for Children (BRIC) using an automated

Abstract = {BackgroundThis work concerns the activities in the last hour before bed
   for young children born to first-time parents, so called bedtime
   routines (BTR). These activities include amongst others tooth brushing,
   reading a book, having a bath and avoiding food and drinks before bed.
   Having a set bedtime at a suitable hour is also very important.
   Establishing good bedtime routines has been shown to be really important
   for a number of health, wellbeing, development and social outcomes.
   Currently, there is no evidence-based bedtime routine intervention for
   first-time parents using a novel design (i.e. text messages). Existing
   research has highlighted the importance of bedtime routines and the lack
   of appropriate mechanisms in place for parents who sought
   support.MethodsThe proposed study includes 2 work packages. Work package
   1 focuses on the development of the intervention through a combination
   of qualitative work (1:1 interviews with parents on barriers and
   facilitators on bedtime routines using the Theoretical Domains
   Framework) and an expert group of key stakeholders. Work package 2
   involves a small-scale (n = 50) feasibility and effectiveness study to
   examine proof of concept with first-time parents using text messages to
   communicate the intervention. Quantitative information relating to
   uptake, engagement, retention and effectiveness of the intervention as
   well as qualitative information (focus groups with parents who took part
   in the study) will be collected. Overall, the effectiveness of the
   intervention will be assessed through the APEASE criteria
   (acceptability, practicability, effectiveness, affordability, safety,
   equity).DiscussionThis study can provide initial yet important support
   for further exploration in the field of bedtime routines in more
   complicated family structures (parents with more than 1 child, separated
   families etc.). Also, the implementation of a novel study design (i.e.
   text messages) could lead to considerable cost savings while maintaining
   high retention, uptake and engagement from the participants. Should the
   intervention meet the APEASE criteria, a more comprehensive intervention
   on bedtime routines for first-time parents will be explored in a more
   robust (RCT and longitudinal) approach.Trials registrationDue to the
   nature of the study, no trial registration is currently in place.},

Title = {Development of a conceptual framework for a group-based format of the

Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise (LiFE) programme
   is a fall prevention programme originally taught in a resource-intensive
   one-to-one format with limited feasibility for large-scale
   implementation. The aim of this paper is to present the conceptual
   framework and initial feasibility evaluation of a group-based LiFE
   (gLiFE) format developed for large-scale implementation.MethodsThe
   conceptual gLiFE framework (part I) is based on three pillars, LiFE
   Activities and Principles, Theory of Behaviour Change and Behaviour
   Change Techniques, and Instruction. The feasibility of gLiFE was tested
   (part II) within a multimodal approach including quantitative
   questionnaires measuring safety, acceptability (1 = best to 7 =
   insufficient), and adherence to the LiFE activities (range=0-14) as well
   as a focus group interview. Exploratory self-reported measures on
   behaviour change including self-determined motivation (range=1-5),
   intention, planning, action control, and habit strength (range=1-6) were
   assessed pre and post intervention. Data analyses were performed using
   descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis.ResultsThe
   development process resulted in a manualised gLiFE concept containing
   standardised information on gLiFE's content and structure. Feasibility
   testing: Six older adults (median=72.8years, 5 female) completed the
   feasibility study and rated safety (median=7.0, IQR=0.3) and
   acceptability as high (median=1, IQR=1). Participants implemented 9.5
   LiFE activities (IQR=4.0) into their daily routines. No adverse events
   occurred during the study. In the focus group, the group format and LiFE
   activities were perceived as positive and important for maintaining
   strength and balance capacity. Self-determined motivation intention,
   planning, and habit strength were rated higher post
   intervention.ConclusionThe developed conceptual gLiFE framework
   represents the basis for a gLiFE format with potential for standardised
   large-scale implementation. Proof-of-concept could be demonstrated in a
   group of community-dwelling older adults at risk of falling. The public
   health potential of gLiFE in terms of (cost-)effectiveness is currently
   being evaluated in a large trial.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov

Title = {Implementing combined WHO mhGAP and adapted group interpersonal
   psychotherapy to address depression and mental health needs of pregnant

Abstract = {BackgroundAddressing adolescent pregnancies associated health burden
   demands new ways of organizing maternal and child mental health services
   to meet multiple needs of this group. There is a need to strengthen
   integration of sustainable evidence-based mental health interventions in
   primary health care settings for pregnant adolescents. The proposed
   study is guided by implementation science frameworks with key objective
   of implementing a pilot trial testing a full IPT-G version along with
   IPT-G mini version under the mhGAP/IPT-G service framework and to study
   feasibility of the integrated mhGAP/IPT-G adolescent peripartum
   depression care delivery model and estimate if a low cost and compressed
   version of IPT-G intervention would result in similar size of effect on
   mental health and family functioning as the Full IPT-G. There are two
   sub- studies embedded which are: 1) To identify multi-level system
   implementation barriers and strategies guided by the Consolidated
   Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to enhance perinatal
   mhGAP-depression care and evidence-based intervention integration (i.e.,
   group interpersonal psychotherapy; IPT-G) for pregnant adolescents in
   primary care contexts; 2) To use findings from aim 1 and observational
   data from Maternal and Child Health (MCH) clinics that run within
   primary health care facilities to develop a mental health implementation
   workflow plan that has buy-in from key stakeholders, as well as to
   develop a modified protocol and implementation training manual for
   building health facility staff's capacity in implementing the integrated
   mhGAP/IPT-G depression care.MethodsFor the primary objective of studying
   feasibility of the integrated mhGAP/IPT-G depression care in MCH service
   context for adolescent perinatal depression, we will recruit 90 pregnant
   adolescents to a three-arm pilot intervention (unmasked) trial study
   (IPT-G Full, IPT-G Mini, and wait-list control in the context of mhGAP
   care). Pregnant adolescents ages 13-18, in their 1st-2nd trimester with
   a depression score of 13 and above on EPDS would be recruited. Proctor's
   implementation evaluation model will be used. Feasibility and
   acceptability of the intervention implementation and size of effects on
   mental health and family functioning will be estimated using mixed
   method data collection from caregivers of adolescents, adolescents, and
   health care providers. In the two sub-studies, stakeholders representing
   diverse perspectives will be recruited and focus group discussions data
   will be gathered. For aim 2, to build capacity for mhGAP-approach of
   adolescent depression care and research, the implementation-capacity
   training manual will be applied to train 20 providers, 12 IPT-G
   implementers/health workers and 16 Kenyan researchers. Acceptability and
   appropriateness of the training approach will be assessed. Additional
   feedback related to co-located service delivery model, task-shifting and
   task-sharing approach of IPT-G delivery will be gathered for further
   manual improvement.DiscussionThis intervention and service design are in
   line with policy priority of Government of Kenya, Kenya Vision 2030,
   World Health Organization, and UN Sustainable Development Goals that
   focus on improving capacity of mental health service systems to reduce
   maternal, child, adolescent health and mental health disparities in
   LMICs. Successfully carrying out this study in Kenya will provide an
   evidence-based intervention service development and implementation model
   for adolescents in other Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries.

Abstract = {BackgroundProblem gambling and gambling disorder are major public health
   concerns worldwide, and awareness of associated negative consequences is
   rising. In parallel, treatment demand has increased, and Internet
   interventions offer a promising alternative for providing evidence-based
   treatment at scale to a low cost.MethodWe developed a novel
   Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral treatment for gambling, based on
   qualitative interviews with treatment-seeking gamblers, behavioral
   research on gambling behavior, and the pathway model for problem
   gambling. This research protocol describes a non-randomized pilot and
   feasibility trial conducted in routine addiction care with adult
   treatment-seeking patients (max N = 25) with problem gambling. The
   primary aim is to ensure acceptability and safety, measured by
   satisfaction, credibility, working alliance, and possible negative
   effects. Secondary aims are feasibility of study procedures in terms of
   recruitment and measurement procedures as well as potential
   effectiveness measured weekly by gambling symptoms as primary outcome
   and gambling behavior, quality of life, symptoms of depression and
   anxiety, alcohol, and drug use as secondary outcomes. Potential
   mediators measured weekly are loss of control, verbal rules, and
   well-being.DiscussionThis study is innovative in several respects,
   regarding both treatment development and implementation. The results of
   the study will guide a future randomized controlled trial, as well as
   the development of the intervention and intervention implementation
   within ordinary addiction care.Trial registrationClinical trials.gov,

Title = {A feasibility, acceptability and fidelity study of a multifaceted

Abstract = {BackgroundDespite the benefits of physical activity for walking ability,
   balance, and mood, less than 30\% of stroke survivors engage in
   recommended levels of physical activity with high levels of sedentary
   behaviour observed. This study aims to assess the feasibility,
   acceptability and fidelity of a theory- and evidence-based multifaceted
   behaviour change intervention targeting free-living physical activity
   and sedentary behaviour after stroke.MethodsThis study will be set in
   community stroke services in the North East of England and will assess
   the feasibility of a behaviour change intervention targeting free-living
   physical activity and sedentary behaviour of stroke survivors and
   consultation behaviour of the healthcare professionals to support stroke
   survivors to make these lifestyle changes. Up to 35 stroke survivors
   currently receiving stroke rehabilitation within the study catchment
   area with capacity and no contraindications to increasing physical
   activity/reducing sedentary behaviour will be recruited. Stroke
   survivors will receive a supported self-management physical
   activity/sedentary behaviour programme incorporating provision of
   information, goal setting, action planning, barrier identification,
   coping planning, self-monitoring and feedback on physical activity and
   sedentary behaviour. The programme will be supported by up to 12
   healthcare professionals (HCPs) recruited from the community stroke
   services taking part in the study. The HCPs will deliver at least two
   face-to-face sessions (baseline, review and subsequent reviews if
   necessary) and provide a range of personalised tools to support each
   individual stroke survivor (e.g. workbook, self-monitoring tools,
   information on local resources). The consultation behaviour of the HCPs
   will be targeted via a training programme incorporating face-to-face
   training, a training manual and individual feedback on intervention
   programme delivery from the study research team. The feasibility,
   acceptability and fidelity of the study protocol will be
   assessed.DiscussionThe most effective methods of supporting stroke
   survivors to alter physical activity and sedentary behaviour have yet to
   be established. This study will establish the feasibility of delivering
   a complex theory- and evidence-based intervention targeting the
   behaviour of both stroke survivors and HCPs and assess whether it is
   acceptable to the target populations. Findings will inform the iterative
   development of the intervention before a larger scale evaluation.Trial

Title = {Body, Soul and Spirit, an adaptation of two evidence-based interventions
   to promote physical activity and healthy eating among adults in churches
   in Lagos Nigeria: a three-arm cluster randomized controlled pilot trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {BackgroundPhysical inactivity and unhealthy eating are two leading
   behavioral risk factors contributing to preventable non-communicable
   diseases (NCDs). Evidence-based interventions (EBI) using
   community-engaged approaches to address these risks abound in
   high-income countries. Comparatively, evidence of such interventions is
   sparse in low- and middle-income countries, where NCD mortality is
   greater. This paper describes the protocol for the development of the
   cultural adaptation and pilot testing of a combination of two EBI (i.e.,
   Body and Soul and the Healthy Body Healthy Spirit), in church-based
   settings in Lagos, Nigeria. In addition, we describe the development of
   the inclusion of an additional component, i.e., faith-based text
   messages, into one of the treatment arms. Our objective is to assess the
   feasibility of developing and implementing the adapted interventions
   with the ultimate aim of developing a fully powered trial.MethodsThis
   pilot study will assess the design and implementation of a three-arm
   cluster-randomized pilot trial in 12 randomly selected Anglican churches
   (4 in each arm). First, we will design a cultural adaptation of the two
   EBI's to form a multifaceted combined intervention known as the Body
   Soul and Spirit. The second treatment arm, i.e., Body Soul and Spirit
   Plus, will retain all the components of Body Soul and Spirit with the
   inclusion of faith-based text messages using mobile phones. Participants
   in the control arm will receive information leaflets designed to
   increase physical activity and healthy food consumption. The outcome
   measures include participant recruitment and retention, program
   participation and satisfaction, and data collection completion rates.
   The outcomes for the proposed definitive trial will be the number of
   servings of fruit and vegetables and minutes of moderate to vigorous
   physical activity per day will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6-month
   follow-up. Implementation outcomes will be assessed using qualitative
   and quantitative methods.DiscussionThe study will enhance the
   understanding of how best to design and implement behavioral
   interventions in church-based settings using community-based
   participatory approaches. It will also inform the development of a
   definitive randomized controlled trial.Trial registrationPan African

Abstract = {BackgroundMost severe mental disorders have their onset between the age
   of 17 and 27, a time when many young adults begin participating in
   secondary or post-secondary education. The cognitive deficits typically
   associated with psychiatric disorders, especially psychotic disorders,
   increase the risk of leaving school early, which can lead to a reduction
   in employment opportunities later on in life and, in turn, a poorer
   long-term prognosis. Therefore, specific interventions aiming to improve
   these cognitive functions are needed. Cognitive remediation (CR) aims to
   improve cognitive functioning and may increase real-world functioning in
   educational performance. This study aims to examine the feasibility and
   applicability of a CR training named Mindset for students with psychotic
   disorders in the Netherlands.Methods/designSixty students diagnosed with
   a psychotic disorder and currently reporting cognitive deficits will be
   included from four Dutch Mental Health Care institutes. Half of the
   participants (N = 30) will be randomly assigned to the CR training
   consisting of twelve, individual, weekly 1-h meetings. The other half
   will be assigned to an active control condition consisting of twelve
   weekly assignments that will be sent by email aiming to improve school
   performance. Students will be evaluated at baseline (T0), directly after
   finishing the CR training or control intervention (T1), and 6 months
   later (T2). Treatment feasibility will be the primary outcome, using
   evaluation forms, interviews with trainers and participants, number of
   study drop outs, and patient eligibility and recruitment rates. School
   functioning, cognitive functioning, and strategy use will also be
   assessed to get a preliminary idea of the potential effectiveness of the
   intervention.DiscussionThe CR training in this study will provide
   real-world examples and exercises aimed to teach useful strategies to
   cope with the cognitive deficits experienced by students with psychotic
   disorders. Furthermore, since students with other psychiatric disorders
   might also experience cognitive deficits, the results of this study may
   also provide some further implications for future studies on the effect
   of this CR training for students with these disorders.Trial

Abstract = {BackgroundContact centres are one of the most sedentary workplaces, with
   employees spending a very high proportion of their working day sitting
   down. About a quarter of contact centre staff regularly experience
   musculoskeletal health problems due to high levels of sedentary
   behaviour, including lower back pain. There have been no previous
   randomised studies specifically aiming to reduce sedentary behaviour in
   contact centre staff. To address this gap, the Stand Up for Health (SUH)
   study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of a complex
   theory-based intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour in contact
   centres.MethodsThe Stand Up for Health study has a stepped wedge cluster
   randomised trial design, which is a pragmatic design whereby clusters
   (contact centres) are randomised to time points at which they will begin
   to receive the intervention. All contact centre staff have the
   opportunity to experience the intervention. To minimise the resource
   burden in this feasibility study, data collection is not continuous, but
   undertaken on a selective number of occasions, so the stepped wedge
   design is ``incomplete{''}. Eleven contact centres in England and
   Scotland have been recruited, and the sample size is approximately 27
   per centre (270 in total). The statistical analysis will predominantly
   focus on assessing feasibility, including the calculation of recruitment
   rates and rates of attrition. Exploratory analysis will be performed to
   compare objectively measured sedentary time in the workplace (measured
   using an activPAL (TM) device) between intervention and control
   conditions using a linear mixed effects regression model.DiscussionTo
   our knowledge, this is the first stepped wedge feasibility study
   conducted in call centres. The rationale and justification of our novel
   staircase stepped wedge design has been presented, and we hope that by
   presenting our study design and statistical analysis plan, it will
   contribute to the literature on stepped wedge trials, and in particular
   feasibility stepped wedge trials. The findings of the study will also
   help inform whether this is a suitable design for other settings where
   data collection is challenging.Trial registrationThe trial has been
   registered on the ISRCTN database: http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN11580369},

Abstract = {Background: Implementation trials aim to test the effects of
   implementation strategies on the adoption, integration or uptake of an
   evidence-based intervention within organisations or settings.
   Feasibility and pilot studies can assist with building and testing
   effective implementation strategies by helping to address uncertainties
   around design and methods, assessing potential implementation strategy
   effects and identifying potential causal mechanisms. This paper aims to
   provide broad guidance for the conduct of feasibility and pilot studies
   for implementation trials.
   Methods: We convened a group with a mutual interest in the use of
   feasibility and pilot trials in implementation science including
   implementation and behavioural science experts and public health
   researchers. We conducted a literature review to identify existing
   recommendations for feasibility and pilot studies, as well as
   publications describing formative processes for implementation trials.
   In the absence of previous explicit guidance for the conduct of
   feasibility or pilot implementation trials specifically, we used the
   effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial design typology proposed by
   Curran and colleagues as a framework for conceptualising the application
   of feasibility and pilot testing of implementation interventions. We
   discuss and offer guidance regarding the aims, methods, design,
   measures, progression criteria and reporting for implementation
   feasibility and pilot studies.
   Conclusions: This paper provides a resource for those undertaking
   preliminary work to enrich and inform larger scale implementation
   trials.},

Title = {Training attention control of very preterm infants: protocol for a
   feasibility study of the Attention Control Training (ACT)},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {BackgroundChildren born preterm may display cognitive, learning, and
   behaviour difficulties as they grow up. In particular, very premature
   birth (gestation age between 28 and less than 32weeks) may put infants
   at increased risk of intellectual deficits and attention deficit
   disorder. Evidence suggests that the basis of these problems may lie in
   difficulties in the development of executive functions. One of the
   earliest executive functions to emerge around 1year of age is the
   ability to control attention. An eye-tracking-based cognitive training
   programme to support this emerging ability, the Attention Control
   Training (ACT), has been developed and tested with typically developing
   infants. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of
   using the ACT with healthy very preterm (VP) infants when they are
   12months of age (corrected age). The ACT has the potential to address
   the need for supporting emerging cognitive abilities of VP infants with
   an early intervention, which may capitalise on infants' neural
   plasticity.Methods/designThe feasibility study is designed to
   investigate whether it is possible to recruit and retain VP infants and
   their families in a randomised trial that compares attention and social
   attention of trained infants against those that are exposed to a control
   procedure. Feasibility issues include the referral/recruitment pathway,
   attendance, and engagement with testing and training sessions,
   completion of tasks, retention in the study, acceptability of outcome
   measures, quality of data collected (particularly, eye-tracking data).
   The results of the study will inform the development of a larger
   randomised trial.DiscussionSeveral lines of evidence emphasise the need
   to support emerging cognitive and learning abilities of preterm infants
   using early interventions. However, early interventions with preterm
   infants, and particularly very preterm ones, face difficulties in
   recruiting and retaining participants. These problems are also augmented
   by the health vulnerability of this population. This feasibility study
   will provide the basis for informing the implementation of an early
   cognitive intervention for very preterm infants.Trial

Abstract = {BackgroundDomestic violence and abuse (DVA) is common and destructive to
   health. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major mental health
   consequence of DVA. People who have experienced DVA have specific needs,
   arising from the repeated and complex nature of the trauma. The National
   Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends more research on the
   effectiveness of psychological interventions for people who have
   experienced DVA. There is growing evidence that mindfulness-based
   interventions may help trauma symptoms.MethodsIntervention refinement
   and randomized controlled feasibility trial. A prototype trauma-informed
   mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (TI-MBCT) intervention will be
   co-produced following qualitative interviews and consensus exercise with
   stakeholders. Participants in the feasibility trial will be recruited
   from DVA agencies in two geographical regions and randomized to receive
   either TI-MBCT or usual care (self-referral to the Improving Access to
   Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service). TI-MBCT will be delivered as a
   group-based eight-week program. It will not be possible to blind the
   participants or the assessors to the study allocation. The following
   factors will inform the feasibility of progressing to a fully powered
   trial: recruitment, retention, intervention fidelity, and the
   acceptability of the intervention and trial design to participants. We
   will also test the feasibility of measuring the following participant
   outcomes before and 6 months post-randomization: PTSD, dissociative
   symptoms, depression, anxiety, DVA re-victimization, self-compassion,
   and mother-reported child health. Process evaluation and economic
   analysis will be embedded within the feasibility trial.DiscussionThis
   study will lead to the development of a TI-MBCT intervention for DVA
   survivors with PTSD and inform the feasibility and design of a fully
   powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). The full trial will aim to
   determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a TI-MBCT
   intervention in improving the clinically important symptoms of PTSD in
   DVA survivors.Trial registrationISRCTN, ISRCTN64458065, Registered 11

Abstract = {BackgroundTraining speech production skills may be a valid intervention
   target for minimally verbal autistic children. Intervention studies have
   explored various approaches albeit on a small scale and with limited
   experimental control or power. We therefore designed a novel app-based
   parent-mediated intervention based on insights from the video modelling
   and cued articulation literature and tested its acceptability and
   usage.MethodsConsultation with the autism community refined the initial
   design and culminated in a pilot trial (n = 19) lasting 16weeks.
   Participants were randomly allocated an intervention duration in an AB
   phase design and undertook weekly probes during baseline and
   intervention via the app. We evaluated the acceptability of the
   intervention via feedback questionnaires and examined the usability
   variables such as adherence to the testing and intervention schedule,
   time spent on the app and trials completed during the intervention
   phase.ResultsHigh acceptability scores indicated that families liked the
   overall goals and features of the app. Ten participants engaged
   meaningfully with the app, completing 82\% of the test trials and
   uploading data in 61\% of intervention weeks; however, of these, only
   three met the targeted 12.5min of intervention per week.ConclusionWe
   discuss the possible reasons for variability in usage data and how
   barriers to participation could be surmounted in the future development
   of this intervention.},

Abstract = {BackgroundExcess gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnant adolescents
   is a major public health concern. Excess GWG increases risk of pregnancy
   complications as well as postpartum and offspring obesity and
   cardiometabolic disease. Prevention interventions for pregnant adults
   that target lifestyle modification (i.e., healthy eating/physical
   activity) show insufficient effectiveness. Pregnant adolescents have
   distinct social-emotional needs, which may contribute to excess GWG.
   From an interpersonal theoretical framework, conflict and low social
   support increase negative emotions, which in turn promote excess GWG
   through mechanisms such as overeating and physical inactivity.MethodsThe
   current manuscript describes the design of a pilot randomized controlled
   feasibility trial of adolescent interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) to
   address social-emotional needs and prevent excess GWG. Up to 50
   pregnant, healthy adolescents 13-19y, 12-18weeks gestation are recruited
   from an interdisciplinary adolescent maternity hospital clinic and
   randomized to IPT + usual care or usual care alone. IPT involves 6
   individual 60-minute sessions delivered by a trained behavioral health
   clinician during 12-30weeks gestation. Sessions include relationship
   psychoeducation, emotion identification and expression, and
   teaching/role-playing communication skills. Between sessions,
   adolescents are instructed to complete a daily journal and to have
   conversations to work on relationship goals. Outcomes are assessed at
   baseline, mid-program, post-program, and 3-months postpartum. Primary
   outcomes are feasibility and acceptability based upon rate of
   recruitment, session attendance, program acceptability ratings, and
   follow-up retention. Secondary outcomes are perinatal social
   functioning, stress, depression, and eating behaviors assessed with
   validated surveys and interviews; perinatal physical activity and sleep
   measured via accelerometer; GWG from measured weights; and at 3-months
   postpartum only, maternal adiposity by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry,
   maternal insulin sensitivity derived from 2-hour oral glucose tolerance
   testing, and infant adiposity by air displacement
   plethysmography.DiscussionThis pilot trial will address a key gap in
   extant understanding of excess GWG prevention for a high-risk population
   of adolescents. If feasible and acceptable, brief psychotherapy to
   address social-emotional needs should be tested for its effectiveness to
   address excess GWG and postpartum maternal/infant health. If effective,
   such an approach has potential to interrupt an adverse,
   intergenerational cycle of social-emotional distress, obesity, and
   cardiometabolic disease among young mothers and their offspring.Trial

Abstract = {BackgroundSocial support has an important role in successful weight
   loss. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and
   acceptability of an app-, web- and social support-based intervention in
   supporting adults with obesity to achieve weight loss.MethodsThe
   intervention and evaluation methods were tested in a feasibility
   randomised controlled trial. Adults in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde
   Health Board area of Scotland with a body mass index >= 30kg/m(2) were
   recruited and randomised 2:1 (intervention to control). The feasibility
   and acceptability of the intervention and trial methods were assessed
   against pre-specified progression criteria, via process, economic and
   outcome evaluation. Three primary outcomes were explored: BMI, diet and
   physical activity, as well as a number of secondary outcomes. The
   intervention group had access to the HelpMeDoIt! intervention for
   12months. This encouraged them to (i) set goals, (ii) monitor progress
   and (iii) harness social support by inviting `helpers' from their
   existing social network. The control group received a healthy lifestyle
   leaflet.ResultsOne hundred and nine participants were recruited, with 84
   participants (77\%) followed-up at 12months. The intervention and trial
   methods were feasible and acceptable. Participants and helpers were
   generally positive. Of the 54 (74\%) participants who downloaded the
   app, 48 (89\%) used it. Interview data indicated that HelpMeDoIt!
   promoted social support from existing social networks to support weight
   loss. This support was often given outside of the app.Outcomes were
   compared using linear regression models, with randomised group, the
   baseline measurement of the outcome, age and gender as predictor
   variables. These analyses were exploratory and underpowered to detect
   effects. However, all pre-specified primary outcome effects (BMI, diet
   and physical activity) had wide confidence intervals and were therefore
   consistent with clinically relevant benefits. Objective physical
   activity measures perhaps showed most potential (daily step count (p =
   0.098; 1187 steps {[}-180, 2555])) and sedentary time (p = 0.022;

Title = {Menstrual product choice and uptake among young women in Zimbabwe: a
   pilot study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {BackgroundMenstrual health and hygiene (MHH) is a human rights issue;
   yet, it remains a challenge for many, especially in low- and
   middle-income countries (LMICs). MHH includes the socio-political,
   psychosocial, and environmental factors that impact women's menstrual
   experiences. High proportions of girls and women in LMICs have
   inadequate MHH due to limited access to menstrual knowledge, products,
   and stigma reinforcing harmful myths and taboos. The aim of this pilot
   was to inform the design of an MHH sub-study and the implementation and
   scale-up of an MHH intervention incorporated into a community-based
   cluster-randomized trial of integrated sexual and reproductive health
   (SRH) services for youth in Zimbabwe. The objectives were to investigate
   (1) uptake of a novel MHH intervention, (2) menstrual product
   preference, and (3) the factors that informed uptake and product choice
   among young women.MethodsFemale participants aged 16-24 years old
   attending the community-based SRH services between April and July 2019
   were offered the MHH intervention, which included either a menstrual cup
   or reusable pads, analgesia, and MHH education. Descriptive statistics
   were used to quantitatively assess uptake and product choice. Focus
   group discussions and in-depth interviews with participants and the
   intervention team were used to investigate the factors that influenced
   uptake and product choice.ResultsOf the 1732 eligible participants, 1414
   (81.6\%) took up the MHH intervention at first visit. Uptake differed by
   age group with 84.6\% of younger women (16-19 years old) compared to
   79.0\% of older women (20-24 years old) taking up the intervention.
   There was higher uptake of reusable pads (88.0\%) than menstrual cups
   (12.0\%). Qualitative data highlighted that internal factors, such as
   intervention delivery, influenced uptake. Participants noted the
   importance of access to free menstrual products, analgesics, and MHH
   education in a youth-friendly environment. External factors such as
   sociocultural factors informed product choice. Barriers to cup uptake
   included fears that the cup would compromise young women's
   virginity.ConclusionsPilot findings were used to improve the MHH
   intervention design and implementation as follows: (1) cup ambassadors
   to improve cup promotion, sensitization, and uptake; (2) use of smaller
   softer cups; and (3) education for community members including
   caregivers and partners.Trial registrationRegistry:

Title = {<i>Active Women over 50</i> online information and support to promote

Abstract = {BackgroundPhysical activity has many physical and mental health benefits
   and can delay the development of disability in older age. However,
   uptake of this health behaviour is sub-optimal in women in their middle
   and older age. This trial aims to establish the acceptability and
   feasibility of the Active Women over 50 programme involving online
   information, telephone health coaching and email or SMS support to
   promote physical activity behaviour change among women aged 50years and
   over.MethodsSixty community-dwelling women who are insufficiently active
   according to national guidelines, will be recruited and randomised to 1)
   receive the Active Women over 50 programme or 2) a wait-list control.
   Active Women over 50 is a 3-month physical activity programme guided by
   behaviour change science, providing access to a website, one
   telephone-delivered health coaching session from a physiotherapist and 8
   email or 24 SMS messages. The primary outcome is the proportion of
   participants at 3months post-randomisation who would recommend
   participation in the programme to another person like themselves.
   Secondary outcomes are feasibility measures: rates of recruitment,
   retention, completeness of outcome data and uptake of telephone support;
   and intervention impact measures: accelerometer-assessed average
   steps/day, proportion of participants meeting national guidelines on
   moderate to vigorous physical activity; and questionnaire-assessed
   quality of life, exercise perceptions, mood, physical functioning and
   self-reported physical activity. Intervention participants will also
   complete a follow-up survey to assess impressions of the intervention
   and adoption of strategies for physical activity participation. Data
   will be analysed descriptively to guide the design of a larger trial.
   Between-group differences in secondary outcomes will be used to estimate
   effect sizes for sample size calculations for a fully powered randomised
   controlled trial.DiscussionThis feasibility pilot trial of an efficient
   eHealth and health coaching intervention guided by user input and

Abstract = {BackgroundIncreasing levels of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), mental
   health problems, high rates of unhealthy behaviours and health
   inequalities remain major public health challenges worldwide. In the
   context of increasing urbanisation, there is an urgent need to
   understand how evidence that living environments shape health, wellbeing
   and behaviour can be used to design and deliver healthy environments in
   local urban settings. The Healthy New Town (HNT) programme implemented
   in England from 2015 consists of ten major housing developments that aim
   to improve population health through healthy design principles, new
   models for integrating health and social care and the creation of strong
   and connected communities. The programme provides a natural experiment
   in which to investigate the effects on health, wellbeing and
   inequalities of large-scale interventions targeting the wider social
   determinants of health.MethodsThe research described in this protocol
   aims to examine the feasibility of a larger study to assess the
   longer-term health impacts of HNTs, by addressing two research
   questions: (1) what are the similarities and differences in the HNT
   programme developments, processes, contexts and expected impacts and
   outcomes across HNT sites? and (2) how feasible is the use of data from
   routine sources and existing HNT evaluations and as the baseline for a
   definitive study to assess impact on health, wellbeing, behavioural and
   economic outcomes and programme processes? The research will consist of
   (a) participatory systems mapping with stakeholders to produce a
   theoretical framework for a longer-term study on the HNT programme, (b)
   synthesis of existing qualitative data from local HNT evaluations to
   understand local processes and intervention mechanisms, (c) scoping
   local and routinely available data to establish a baseline and
   feasibility for a longer-term study of health and economic outcomes, and
   (d) building relationships and recruiting HNT sites into the proposed
   research.DiscussionThe proposed research will produce a theoretical
   framework and assess the feasibility of a definitive study of outcomes
   of the HNT programme. This research is necessary to understand how
   longer-term health, wellbeing, behavioural and economic outcomes can be
   measured, and to inform a definitive study to generate evidence on the
   effectiveness of the HNT programme.},

Abstract = {Background The PACE `Steps to Success' programme is a complex
   educational and development intervention for staff to improve palliative
   care in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). In a cluster randomized
   controlled trial, this programme has been implemented in 37 LTCFs in 7
   European countries. Alongside an effectiveness study, a process
   evaluation study was conducted. This paper reports on the results of
   this process evaluation, of which the aim was to provide a more detailed
   understanding of the implementation of the PACE Programme across and
   within countries. Methods The process evaluation followed the Reach,
   Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework
   and involved various measures and tools, including diaries for country
   trainers, evaluation questionnaires for care staff, attendance lists and
   interviews (online and face-to-face, individual and in groups) with
   country trainers, managers, PACE coordinators and other staff members.
   Based on key elements of the PACE Programme, a priori criteria for a
   high, medium and low level of the RE-AIM components Reach, Adoption,
   Implementation and intention to Maintenance were defined. Qualitative
   data on factors affecting each RE-AIM component gathered in the online
   discussion groups and interviews were analysed according to the
   principles of thematic analysis. Results The performance of the PACE
   Programme on the RE-AIM components was highly variable within and across
   countries, with a high or medium score for in total 28 (out of 37) LTCFs
   on Reach, for 26 LTCFs on Adoption, for 35 LTCFs on Implementation and
   for 34 LTCFs on intention to Maintenance. The factors affecting
   performance on the different RE-AIM components could be classified into
   three major categories: (1) the PACE Programme itself and its way of
   delivery, (2) people working with the PACE Programme and (3) contextual
   factors. Several country-specific challenges in implementing the PACE
   Programme were identified. Conclusions The implementation of the PACE
   Programme was feasible but leaves room for improvement. Our analysis
   helps to better understand the optimal levels of training and
   facilitation and provides recommendations to improve implementation in
   the LTC setting. The results of the process evaluation will be used to
   further adapt and improve the PACE Programme prior to its further
   dissemination.},

Title = {Adapting evidence-informed complex population health interventions for
   new contexts: a systematic review of guidance},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Background Adapting interventions that have worked elsewhere can save
   resources associated with developing new interventions for each specific
   context. While a developing body of evidence shows benefits of adapted
   interventions compared with interventions transported without
   adaptation, there are also examples of interventions which have been
   extensively adapted, yet have not worked in the new context. Decisions
   on when, to what extent, and how to adapt interventions therefore are
   not straightforward, particularly when conceptualising intervention
   effects as contingent upon contextual interactions in complex systems.
   No guidance currently addresses these questions comprehensively. To
   inform development of an overarching guidance on adaptation of complex
   population health interventions, this systematic review synthesises the
   content of the existing guidance papers. Methods We searched for papers
   published between January 2000 and October 2018 in 7 bibliographic
   databases. We used citation tracking and contacted authors and experts
   to locate further papers. We double screened all the identified records.
   We extracted data into the following categories: descriptive
   information, key concepts and definitions, rationale for adaptation,
   aspects of adaptation, process of adaptation, evaluating and reporting
   adapted interventions. Data extraction was conducted independently by
   two reviewers, and retrieved data were synthesised thematically within
   pre-specified and emergent categories. Results We retrieved 6694 unique
   records. Thirty-eight papers were included in the review representing 35
   sources of guidance. Most papers were developed in the USA in the
   context of implementing evidence-informed interventions among different
   population groups within the country, such as minority populations. We
   found much agreement on how the papers defined key concepts, aims, and
   procedures of adaptation, including involvement of key stakeholders, but
   also identified gaps in scope, conceptualisation, and operationalisation
   in several categories. Conclusions Our review found limitations that
   should be addressed in future guidance on adaptation. Specifically,
   future guidance needs to be reflective of adaptations in the context of
   transferring interventions across countries, including macro- (e.g.
   national-) level interventions, better theorise the role of intervention
   mechanisms and contextual interactions in the replicability of effects
   and accordingly conceptualise key concepts, such as fidelity to
   intervention functions, and finally, suggest evidence-informed
   strategies for adaptation re-evaluation and reporting.},

Title = {Adapting TeamSTEPPS for school mental health teams: a pilot study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background School mental health care often is provided by teams
   contracted from community mental health agencies. The team members that
   provide this care, however, do not typically receive training in how to
   work effectively in a team-based context. Team Strategies and Tools to
   Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS) provides a
   promising, evidence-based strategy for improving communication and
   climate in school-based teams. Methods In collaboration with
   stakeholders, we adapted and piloted TeamSTEPPS for use with school
   mental health teams. Teams in six schools were randomized to receive the
   adapted TeamSTEPPS approach or usual supports. The main outcomes of
   interest were feasibility and acceptability of the adapted TeamSTEPPS
   strategy. Results Results indicated that team member burnout was
   significantly higher at follow-up than pretreatment for both control and
   intervention teams. TeamSTEPPS was feasible and acceptable to implement,
   and leadership emerged as an important facilitator. Barriers to
   implementation success included staff turnover, lack of resources, and
   challenges in the school mental health team relationship. Additional
   supports to implement TeamSTEPPS were suggested, including ongoing
   consultation and booster training to address high staff turnover.
   Conclusions Results suggest that TeamSTEPPS is promising for school
   mental health teams but additional modifications are likely needed.},

Abstract = {Public health advocates have been calling for an intensified focus on
   early, middle, and late adolescence health behaviours due to both the
   short- and long-term health consequences. Hence, both the health-risk
   (e.g., alcohol consumption) and health-promoting (e.g., physical
   activity) behaviours of adolescents have been widely studied to better
   understand the underlying causes or determinants with an eye towards
   implementing more effective interventions. The success of these
   interventions, typically grounded in a
   risk-reduction/prevention-oriented intervention approach has been
   modest, especially those focused on health-promoting behaviours, such as
   physical activity. The purposes of this paper are to (1) conduct a
   conceptual critique of the risk-reduction/prevention-oriented approach
   underlying traditional adolescent physical activity interventions, and
   (2) examine the potential usefulness of an emerging person-based,
   development-oriented (PBDO) approach for enhancing the motivation and
   sustainability of adolescent physical activity. Within this PBDO
   perspective, emphasis is on adolescent growth and development as the
   starting point for initiating and sustaining physical activity.
   Implications of the PBDO approach for adolescent physical activity
   interventions are presented.},

Title = {A virtual reality intervention for fear of movement for Veterans with
   chronic pain: protocol for a feasibility study},

Abstract = {Background A key concern for people with chronic pain is experiencing
   increased pain and/or re-injury. Consequently, individuals with chronic
   pain can develop a maladaptive fear of movement that leads to adverse
   functional consequences. A primary goal of chronic pain rehabilitation
   is re-engagement in feared movements through exposure. This is often
   challenging since safe movement can be uncomfortable. Virtual
   environments provide a promising opportunity to safely and gradually
   expose Veterans to movements that are avoided in the real world. The
   current study will utilize multiple virtual reality (VR) applications
   (APPs) of varying the intensity levels ranging from passive distraction
   from pain to active exposure to feared movement. The primary aims of
   this pilot are to examine VR as an adjunctive nonpharmacological
   intervention to assist with the adoption and implementation of skills to
   decrease fear of movement and increase overall functioning among
   Veterans with chronic pain. Second, to build a hierarchy of VR APPs to
   assist in gradual exposure to feared movements. Methods This study will
   be conducted in the Chronic Pain Rehabilitation Program (CPRP) at the
   James A. Haley Veterans Hospital, a unique inpatient program within the
   VA system. Participants will include up to 20 Veterans who receive a VR
   intervention as part of their physical therapy. A rating form containing
   qualitative and quantitative experiences will be administered following
   each VR session to assess feasibility and to provide descriptive
   information for the proposed hierarchy. Effect sizes will be calculated
   from intake and discharge measures for the primary outcome fear of
   movement and secondary pain and functional outcomes. Discussion This
   study will inform the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial
   examining the clinical utility of using VR to reduce fear of movement
   and increase function among Veterans with chronic pain. VR has the
   advantage of being easily implemented both within VA healthcare settings
   as well as in Veterans' own residences, where engagement in ongoing
   self-management approaches is often most challenging. Presumably, VR
   that is matched to patient needs, progresses in intensity, immerses
   Veterans in the applications, and is perceived positively by Veterans,
   will result in positive functional outcomes.},

Title = {Action, actor, context, target, time (AACTT): a framework for specifying
   behaviour},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Background Designing implementation interventions to change the
   behaviour of healthcare providers and other professionals in the health
   system requires detailed specification of the behaviour(s) targeted for
   change to ensure alignment between intervention components and measured
   outcomes. Detailed behaviour specification can help to clarify
   evidence-practice gaps, clarify who needs to do what differently,
   identify modifiable barriers and enablers, design interventions to
   address these and ultimately provides an indicator of what to measure to
   evaluate an intervention's effect on behaviour change. An existing
   behaviour specification framework proposes four domains (Target, Action,
   Context, Time; TACT), but insufficiently clarifies who is performing the
   behaviour (i.e. the Actor). Specifying the Actor is especially important
   in healthcare settings characterised by multiple behaviours performed by
   multiple different people. We propose and describe an extension and
   re-ordering of TACT to enhance its utility to implementation
   intervention designers, practitioners and trialists: the Action, Actor,
   Context, Target, Time (AACTT) framework. We aim to demonstrate its
   application across key steps of implementation research and to provide
   tools for its use in practice to clarify the behaviours of stakeholders
   across multiple levels of the healthcare system. Methods and results We
   used French et al.'s four-step implementation process model to describe
   the potential applications of the AACTT framework for (a) clarifying who
   needs to do what differently, (b) identifying barriers and enablers, (c)
   selecting fit-for-purpose intervention strategies and components and (d)
   evaluating implementation interventions. Conclusions Describing and
   detailing behaviour using the AACTT framework may help to enhance
   measurement of theoretical constructs, inform development of topic
   guides and questionnaires, enhance the design of implementation
   interventions and clarify outcome measurement for evaluating
   implementation interventions.},

Title = {The impact of basic vs. enhanced Go NAPSACC on child care centers'
   healthy eating and physical activity practices: protocol for a type 3
   hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: To prevent childhood obesity and promote healthy
   development, health authorities recommend that child care programs use
   the evidence-based practices that foster healthy eating and physical
   habits in children. Go NAPSACC is an intervention shown to improve use
   of these recommended practices, but it is known to encounter barriers
   that limit its impact and widespread use.
   Methods: This study will use a type 3 hybrid
   effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized trial to compare
   effectiveness and implementation outcomes achieved from Go NAPSACC
   delivered with a basic or enhanced implementation approach. Participants
   will include approximately 25 coaches from Child Care Aware of Kentucky
   (serving four geographic regions), 97 child care centers with a director
   and teacher from each and two cross-sectional samples of 485
   3-4-year-old children (one recruitment at baseline, another at
   follow-up). Coaches will be randomly assigned to deliver Go NAPSACC
   using either the basic or enhanced implementation approach. ``Basic Go
   NAPSACC{''} represents the traditional way of delivering Go NAPSACC.
   ``Enhanced Go NAPSACC{''} incorporates preparatory and support
   activities before and during their Go NAPSACC work, which are guided by
   the Quality Implementation Framework and the Consolidated Framework for
   Implementation Research. Data will be collected primarily at baseline
   and post-intervention, with select measures continuing through 6, 12,
   and 24 months postintervention. Guided largely by RE-AIM, outcomes will
   assess change in centers' use of evidence-based nutrition and physical
   activity practices (primary, measured via observation); centers'
   adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the Go NAPSACC program
   (assessed via website use); center directors', teachers', and coaches'
   perceptions of contextual factors (assessed via self-report surveys);
   children's eating and physical activity behaviors at child care
   (measured via observation and accelerometers); and cost-effectiveness
   (assessed via logs and expense tracking). The hypotheses anticipate that
   ``Enhanced Go NAPSACC{''} will have greater effects than ``Basic Go
   NAPSACC.{''}
   Discussion: This study incorporates many lessons gleaned from the
   growing implementation science field, but also offers opportunities to
   address the field's research priorities, including applying a systematic
   method to tailor implementation strategies, examining the processes and
   mechanisms through which implementation strategies produce their
   effects, and conducting an economic evaluation of implementation
   strategies.},

Abstract = {To optimize digital health interventions, intervention creators must
   determine what intervention dose will produce the most substantial
   health behavior change-the dose-response relationship-while minimizing
   harms or burden. In this article we present important concepts,
   considerations, and challenges in studying dose-response relationships
   in digital health interventions. We propose that interventions make
   three types of prescriptions: (1) intervention action prescriptions,
   prescriptions to receive content from the intervention, such as to read
   text or listen to audio; (2) participant action prescriptions,
   prescriptions to produce and provide content to the intervention, such
   as to send text messages or post intervention-requested photos on social
   media; and (3) behavioral target action prescriptions, prescriptions to
   engage in behaviors outside the intervention, such as changing food
   intake or meditating. Each type of prescription has both an intended
   dose (i.e., what the intervention actually prescribes) and an enacted
   dose (i.e., what portion of the intended dose is actually completed by
   the participant). Dose parameters of duration, frequency, and amount can
   be applied to each prescription type. We consider adaptive interventions
   and interventions with ad libitum prescriptions as examples of tailored
   doses. Researchers can experimentally manipulate the intended dose to
   determine the dose-response relationship. The enacted dose cannot be
   directly manipulated; however, we consider the applicability of
   ``controlled concentration{''} research design to the study of enacted
   dose. We consider challenges in dose-response research in digital health
   interventions, including characterizing amount with self-paced
   activities and combining doses across modality. The presented concepts
   and considerations may help contribute to the optimization of digital
   health interventions.},

Month = {AUG 2},
Abstract = {Objectives: To establish which Social Cognitive Theory constructs
   mediated effects of the MobileMums (MMP) program on increased duration
   and frequency of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in women
   with young children (<5 years). Methods: This secondary data analysis is
   from a community-based randomised controlled trial. Over 12 weeks,
   intervention participants received a minimum of 52 individually tailored
   text messages, one face-to-face and one telephone-delivered session with
   a trained behavioural counsellor. Participants identified a support
   person who also received 12 weeks of individually tailored text
   messages. Control participants received minimal intervention contact.
   Data were collected pre- and post-program. Five potential mediators were
   assessed: barrier self-efficacy, goal setting skills, outcome
   expectancies, perceived environmental opportunity for physical activity
   and social support for physical activity. Results: Improvements in MVPA
   frequency were mediated by improvements in barrier self-efficacy, goal
   setting skills, outcome expectancies and perceived social support.
   Improvements in MVPA duration resulting from the MMP were mediated by
   improvements in women's barrier self-efficacy and goal setting skills.
   Conclusions: MMP improved targeted theoretical constructs and this led
   to changes in women's MVPA. These findings are valuable for refinement
   and translation of the MMP and for further research to create theory-
   and evidence-based physical activity behaviour change programs for women
   with young children.},

Title = {A feasibility study of `The StepSmart Challenge' to promote physical

Abstract = {Background Inactive lifestyles are becoming the norm and creative
   approaches to encourage adolescents to be more physically active are
   needed. Little is known about how gamification techniques can be used in
   physical activity interventions for young people. Such approaches may
   stimulate interest and encourage physical activity behaviour. The study
   investigated the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a physical
   activity intervention for adolescents which included gamification
   techniques within schools. We tested recruitment and retention
   strategies for schools and participants, the use of proposed outcome
   measures, and explored intervention acceptability. Methods This
   school-based feasibility study of a randomised cluster trial recruited
   adolescents aged 12-14 years (n = 224) from five schools (three
   intervention; two control) in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The 22-week
   intervention (The StepSmart Challenge) informed by self-determination
   theory and incorporating gamification strategies involved a school-based
   pedometer competition. Outcomes, measured at baseline, and
   post-intervention (at 22 weeks post-baseline and 52 weeks post-baseline)
   included daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)
   (measured using ActiGraph accelerometer), mental wellbeing
   (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale), social support for physical
   activity, time preference (for delayed and larger rewards or immediate
   and smaller rewards), pro-social behaviour (Strengths and Difficulties
   Questionnaire (SDQ)) and the influence of social networks. The
   intervention's acceptability was explored in focus groups. Results We
   invited 14 schools to participate; eight showed interest in
   participating. We recruited the first five who responded; all five
   completed the trial. Of the 236 pupils invited, 224 participated
   (94.9\%): 84.8\% (190/224) provided valid MVPA (minutes/day) at baseline
   and 57.2\% (123/215) at 52 weeks. All other outcomes were well completed
   apart from the SDQ (65\% at baseline). Qualitative data highlighted that
   participants and teachers found The StepSmart Challenge to be an
   acceptable intervention. Conclusions The level of interest and high
   recruitment and retention rates provide support for the feasibility of
   this trial. The intervention, incorporating gamification strategies and
   the recruitment methods, using parental opt-out procedures, were
   acceptable to participants and teachers. Teachers also suggested that
   the implementation of The StepSmart Challenge could be embedded in a
   lifelong learning approach to health within the school curriculum. As
   young people's lives become more intertwined with technology, the use of
   innovative gamified interventions could be one approach to engage and
   motivate health behavioural change in this population.},

Abstract = {Background Researchers publish the processes they use to develop
   interventions to improve health. Reflecting on this endeavour may help
   future developers to improve their practice. Methods Our aim was to
   collate, describe, and analyse the actions developers take when
   developing complex interventions to improve health. We carried out a
   systematic mapping review of empirical research studies that report the
   development of complex interventions to improve health. A search was
   undertaken of five databases over 2015-2016 using the term `intervention
   dev{*}'. Eighty-seven journal articles reporting the process of
   intervention development were identified. A purposive subset of 30
   articles, using a range of published approaches to developing
   interventions, was selected for in-depth analysis using principles of
   realist synthesis to identify the actions of intervention development
   and rationales underpinning those actions. Results The 87 articles were
   from the USA (39/87), the UK (32/87), continental Europe (6/87), and the
   rest of the world (10/87). These mainly took a pragmatic self-selected
   approach (n = 43); a theory- and evidence-based approach, e.g.
   Intervention Mapping, Behaviour Change Wheel (n = 22); or a partnership
   approach, e.g. community-based participatory research, co-design (n =
   10). Ten actions of intervention development were identified from the
   subset of 30 articles, including identifying a need for an intervention,
   selecting the intervention development approach to follow, considering
   the needs of the target population, reviewing published evidence,
   involving stakeholders, drawing or generating theory, and designing and
   refining the intervention. Rationales for these actions were that they
   would produce more engaging, acceptable, feasible, and effective
   interventions. Conclusions Developers take a variety of approaches to
   the international endeavour of complex intervention development. We have
   identified and described a set of actions taken within this endeavour
   regardless of whether developers follow a published approach or not.
   Future developers can use these actions and the rationales that underpin
   them to help them make decisions about the process of intervention
   development.},

Abstract = {Background Problems with oral language skills in childhood have been
   linked with poor educational, employment, and mental health outcomes. In
   the UK, there is increasing concern about the oral language skills of
   children, particularly children from areas of social disadvantage.
   Research emphasises the importance of the home language environment as a
   fundamental bedrock for the development of oral language skills. It is
   vital, therefore, that support is available to help families in need to
   provide the optimal language environment for their child. Talking
   Together is a 6-week home visiting programme recently commissioned by
   Better Start Bradford to develop parents' knowledge of the importance of
   a good language environment and help to improve parent-child
   interactions. This study represents the initial steps in developing a
   definitive trial of the Talking Together programme. Method This study is
   a two-arm randomised controlled feasibility study in which families
   referred into the Talking Together programme and consent to participate
   in the trial will be randomly allocated to either an intervention group
   or a waiting control group. We will assess the recruitment and retention
   rates, the representativeness of our sample, the appropriateness of our
   measures, and the sample size needed for a definitive trial. We will
   also carry out a qualitative evaluation to explore the acceptability of
   trial procedures for families and service providers, fidelity of
   delivery, time and resources for training, and barriers and facilitators
   to engagement with the programme. Clear progression criteria will be
   used to assess suitability for a definitive trial. Conclusion This
   feasibility study will inform the development of a definitive trial of
   this home-based visiting programme, which will add to the sparse
   evidence base on which practitioners can draw when supporting families
   in need. The lessons learnt from this feasibility study will also inform
   the wider evaluation work of the Better Start Bradford Innovation Hub.},

Abstract = {Frequent weight loss dieting leads to increased BMI and is associated
   with eating pathologies. Theoretical models can aid the development of
   interventions to reduce risk behaviours such as frequent dieting if they
   are able to adequately account for the target behaviour. The Prototype
   Willingness Model (PWM) may be able to account for weight loss dieting
   as this behaviour is often associated with social images. This study
   explored whether the PWM could predict weight loss dieting status over
   and above the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). One hundred and
   ninety-two participants (69\% female; mode age 35-44) completed PWM and
   TPB measures and recorded their height and weight. Males were more
   likely to be non-dieters than females. Frequent dieters had a higher BMI
   than non-dieters and rated themselves as more similar to the overweight
   prototype. Prototype perceptions predicted willingness to eat unhealthy
   foods alone. Similarity to the overweight prototype predicted weight
   loss dieting status over and above TPB measures and sex. Further
   research should explore prototype perceptions in an obese/overweight
   frequent dieting population as this may be a fruitful direction for
   developing interventions to reduce weight loss dieting.},

Abstract = {Most health behaviour intervention efforts are adapted from the typical
   psychological treatment experience and may not take into serious
   consideration theories specifically developed to describe the process of
   adaptation to illness. This paper presents a proposal for the
   combination of a theory about the experience of and adaptation to
   illness, that is, the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM), and
   an efficient psychological theory and therapy, Acceptance and Commitment
   Therapy (ACT). Past combinations of CSM with cognitive or
   cognitive-behavioural interventions have focussed almost only on
   specific aspects of this model (mostly, illness representations and
   action plans) and left out other, equally important for a fruitful
   adaptation to illness, recommendations of the model (e.g., regarding the
   system coherence). Therefore, the development of the proposed
   combination is to try to match a broad array of the CSM aspects with the
   principles, intervention techniques and methods employed by ACT, in
   order to produce a `double-pillared' intervention strategy that may
   prove especially effective for promoting patients' adaptation to a
   chronic condition and enhancing their well-being and health.},

Abstract = {Background Newborn blood spot (NBS) screening seeks to prevent ill
   health, disability and death through early diagnosis and effective
   intervention. Each year, around 10,000 parents of babies born in England
   are given a positive NBS result indicating their child may be affected
   or carriers of one of the nine conditions currently screened for.
   Despite guidance, these results are inconsistently delivered to parents
   across geographical regions. There is evidence that many parents are
   dissatisfied with how NBS results are communicated to them and that poor
   communication practices can lead to various negative sequelae. The
   purpose of this study is to co-design, implement and undertake a process
   evaluation of new, co-designed interventions to improve delivery of
   initial positive NBS results to parents. Methods This mixed-methods
   study will use four phases with defined outputs. Family Systems Theory
   will form the theoretical basis for the study. The principles and
   methods of experience-based co-design will underpin intervention
   development. Normalisation Process Theory will underpin the process
   evaluation of the interventions co-designed to improve the delivery of
   positive NBS results to parents. An economic analysis will determine
   resource use and costs of current practice and of implementing the new
   co-designed interventions. The nominal group technique will be used to
   inform the selection of suitable outcome measures for a future
   evaluation study. Discussion The main output of the proposed study will
   be co-designed interventions for initial communication of positive NBS
   results to parents ready to be evaluated in a definitive evaluation
   study. The interventions, co-designed with parents, will help to
   minimise potential negative sequelae associated with poor communication
   practices by considering parental and staff experiences as well as
   healthcare challenges such as finite resources. In addition, information
   about indicative costs associated with different communication
   strategies will be determined. It is anticipated it may also be possible
   to extrapolate principles of good communication practices from the
   present study for the delivery of bad news to parents for children newly
   diagnosed with other conditions including cancer and other chronic
   conditions such as diabetes or epilepsy.},

Abstract = {Background: Cancer affects millions of individuals globally, with a
   mortality rate of over eight million people annually. Although
   palliative care is often provided outside of specialist services, many
   people require, at some point in their illness journey, support from
   specialist palliative care services, for example, those provided in
   hospice settings. This transition can be a time of uncertainty and fear,
   and there is a need for effective interventions to meet the
   psychological and supportive care needs of people with cancer that
   cannot be cured. Whilst Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been
   shown to be effective across diverse health problems, robust evidence
   for its effectiveness in palliative cancer populations is not extensive.
   Method: This mixed-methods study uses a single-case experimental design
   with embedded qualitative interviews to pilot test a novel intervention
   for this patient group. Between 14 and 20 patients will be recruited
   from two hospices in England and Scotland. Participants will receive
   five face-to-face manualised sessions with a psychological therapist.
   Sessions are structured around teaching core ACT skills (openness,
   awareness and engagement) as a way to deal effectively with challenges
   of transition into specialist palliative care services. Outcome measures
   include cancer-specific quality of life (primary outcome) and distress
   (secondary outcome), which are assessed alongside measures of
   psychological flexibility. Daily diary outcome assessments will be taken
   for key measures, alongside more detailed weekly self-report, through
   baseline, intervention and 1-month follow-up phases. After follow-up,
   participants will be invited to take part in a qualitative interview to
   understand their experience of taking part and acceptability and
   perceived effectiveness of the intervention and its components.
   Discussion: This study is the first investigation of using ACT with
   terminally ill patients at the beginning of their transition into
   palliative treatment. Using in-depth single-case approaches, we will
   refine and manualise intervention content by the close of the study for
   use in follow-up research trials. Our long-term goal is then to test the
   intervention as delivered by non-psychologist specialist palliative care
   practitioners thus broadening the potential relevance of the approach.},

Title = {Designing high-quality implementation research: development,

   implementation science research development (ImpRes) tool and guide},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background Designing implementation research can be a complex and
   daunting task, especially for applied health researchers who have not
   received specialist training in implementation science. We developed the
   Implementation Science Research Development (ImpRes) tool and
   supplementary guide to address this challenge and provide researchers
   with a systematic approach to designing implementation research. Methods
   A multi-method and multi-stage approach was employed. An international,
   multidisciplinary expert panel engaged in an iterative brainstorming and
   consensus-building process to generate core domains of the ImpRes tool,
   representing core implementation science principles and concepts that
   researchers should consider when designing implementation research.
   Simultaneously, an iterative process of reviewing the literature and
   expert input informed the development and content of the tool. Once
   consensus had been reached, specialist expert input was sought on
   involving and engaging patients/service users; and economic evaluation.
   ImpRes was then applied to 15 implementation and improvement science
   projects across the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)
   Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care
   (CLAHRC) South London, a research organisation in London, UK.
   Researchers who applied the ImpRes tool completed an 11-item
   questionnaire evaluating its structure, content and usefulness. Results
   Consensus was reached on ten implementation science domains to be
   considered when designing implementation research. These include
   implementation theories, frameworks and models, determinants of
   implementation, implementation strategies, implementation outcomes and
   unintended consequences. Researchers who used the ImpRes tool found it
   useful for identifying project areas where implementation science is
   lacking (median 5/5, IQR 4-5) and for improving the quality of
   implementation research (median 4/5, IQR 4-5) and agreed that it
   contained the key components that should be considered when designing
   implementation research (median 4/5, IQR 4-4). Qualitative feedback from
   researchers who applied the ImpRes tool indicated that a supplementary
   guide was needed to facilitate use of the tool. Conclusions We have
   developed a feasible and acceptable tool, and supplementary guide, to
   facilitate consideration and incorporation of core principles and
   concepts of implementation science in applied health implementation
   research. Future research is needed to establish whether application of
   the tool and guide has an effect on the quality of implementation
   research.},

Abstract = {Objective: Mindfulness interventions have been shown to reduce stress;
   however, the mechanisms driving stress resilience effects are not known.
   Mindfulness interventions aim to teach individuals how to: (a) use
   attention to monitor present moment experiences; with (b) an attitude of
   acceptance and equanimity. A randomized controlled dismantling trial
   (RCT) was conducted to test the prediction that the removal of
   acceptance skills training would eliminate stress-reduction benefits of
   a mindfulness intervention. Method: This preregistered RCT randomly
   assigned stressed community adults to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) Monitor and
   Accept (MA) mindfulness training, a standard 8-week Mindfulness-Based
   Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention that provided explicit instruction
   in developing both monitoring and acceptance skills; (b) Monitor Only
   (MO) mindfulness training, a well-matched 8-week MBSR intervention that
   taught monitoring skills only; or (c) No Treatment (NT) control. Stress
   and nonjudgment were measured using ecological momentary assessment
   (EMA) for 3 days at baseline and 3 days at postintervention. Results:
   Consistent with predictions, MA participants increased in nonjudgment
   and decreased in both stress ratings and the proportion of assessments
   that they reported experiencing feelings of stress in daily life,
   relative to both MO and NT participants. Conclusions: This RCT provides
   one of the first experimental tests of the mechanisms linking
   mindfulness interventions with stress resilience. These findings suggest
   that acceptance skills training may be a necessary active ingredient and
   support the value of integrating acceptance skills training into
   stress-reduction interventions.},

Abstract = {Background: Visualisations and readily-accessible web-based
   supplementary files can improve data reporting and transparency. In this
   paper, we make use of recent developments in software and psychological
   network analysis to describe the baseline cohort of a trial testing the
   Let's Move It intervention, which aimed to increase physical activity
   (PA) and reduce sedentary behaviours (SB) among vocational school
   students.
   Methods: At baseline, 1166 adolescents, distributed across 6 school
   clusters and four educational tracks, completed measures of PA and SB,
   theoretical predictors of these behaviours, and body composition. Within
   a comprehensive website supplement, which includes all code and
   analyses, data were tabulated and visualised, and network analyses
   explored relations between predictor variables and outcomes.
   Results: Average daily moderate-to-vigorous PA was 65 min (CI95: 57
   min-73 min), and SB 8h44 min (CI95: 8h04min-9h24 min), with 25.8 (CI95:
   23.5-28.0) interruptions to sitting. Cluster randomisation appeared to
   result in balanced distributions for baseline characteristics between
   intervention and control groups, but differences emerged across the four
   educational tracks. Self-reported behaviour change technique (BCT) use
   was low for many but not all techniques. A network analysis revealed
   direct relationships between PA and behavioural experiments, planning
   and autonomous motivation, and several BCTs were connected to PA via
   autonomous motivation. Visualisation uncovered a case of Simpson's
   paradox.
   Conclusions: Data-visualisation and data exploration techniques (e.g.
   network analysis) can help reveal the dynamics involved in complex
   multi-causal systems - a challenging task with traditional data
   presentations. The benefits of presenting complex data visually should
   encourage researchers to publish extensive analyses and descriptions as
   website supplements, which would increase the speed and quality of
   scientific communication, as well as help to address the crisis of
   reduced confidence in research findings. We hope that this example will
   serve as a template for other investigators to improve upon in the
   future.},

Abstract = {Music interventions are used for stress reduction in a variety of
   settings because of the positive effects of music listening on both
   physiological arousal (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, and hormonal
   levels) and psychological stress experiences (e.g., restlessness,
   anxiety, and nervousness). To summarize the growing body of empirical
   research, two multilevel meta-analyses of 104 RCTs, containing 327
   effect sizes and 9,617 participants, were performed to assess the
   strength of the effects of music interventions on both physiological and
   psychological stress-related outcomes, and to test the potential
   moderators of the intervention effects. Results showed that music
   interventions had an overall significant effect on stress reduction in
   both physiological (d = .380) and psychological (d = .545) outcomes.
   Further, moderator analyses showed that the type of outcome assessment
   moderated the effects of music interventions on stress-related outcomes.
   Larger effects were found on heart rate (d = .456), compared to blood
   pressure (d = .343) and hormone levels (d = .349). Implications for
   stress-reducing music interventions are discussed.},

Title = {Identifying Pathways to Quitting Smoking via Telemedicine-Delivered Care},

Abstract = {Objective: A randomized controlled trial of quitline-like phone
   counseling (QL) versus telemedicine integrated into primary care (ITM)
   compared the effectiveness of these modalities for smoking cessation.
   Study design and components were based on self-determination theory
   (SDT). The purpose of this study was to test our SDT-based model in
   which perceived health care provider autonomy support, working alliance,
   autonomous motivation, and perceived competence were hypothesized to
   mediate the effects of ITM on smoking cessation. Method: Rural smokers
   (n = 560) were randomized to receive 4 sessions over a 3-month period of
   either QL or ITM. Follow-up assessments were conducted at Months 3, 6,
   and 12. The primary outcome was biochemically verified 7-day point
   prevalence at 12 -months. Structural equation modeling with latent
   change scores was used for the analysis. Results: Participants in the
   ITM condition reported greater increases in perceived health care
   provider autonomy support (PAS) at end of treatment, which in turn was
   associated with enhanced perceived competence to quit smoking (PC).
   Increased PC was associated with a higher likelihood of cessation at
   12-months. Mediation analysis demonstrated significant indirect effects,
   including a path from ITM to increases in PAS to increases in PC to
   cessation at 12-months (indirect effect = 0.0183, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}.003, .0434]). Conclusions: When integrated into primary
   care, ITM may influence smoking cessation by enhancing the extent to
   which smokers feel supported by their providers and thereby increase
   their perceived ability to quit. Findings suggest that locating tobacco
   treatment services in health care provider offices imparts a
   motivational benefit for cessation.},

Title = {A classroom-based intervention targeting working memory, attention and
   language skills in 4-5 year olds (RECALL): study protocol for a cluster
   randomised feasibility trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background There is international recognition of the need for creative,
   classroom-based interventions to support children at risk of low
   academic achievement and well-being, due to poor attention and language
   skills on school entry. Working memory (WM) is a cognitive skill that is
   strongly associated with attention and language skills. There has been
   speculation that WM training, embedded within typical educational
   activities, may improve children's WM skills and produce transfer
   effects to real-world skills such as attention and language. However,
   little is known about the effectiveness of this approach. `Recall to
   Enhance Children's Attention, Language and Learning' (RECALL) is a
   novel, 6-week, classroom-based intervention targeting WM, attention and
   language skills in 4-5 year olds. RECALL was co-produced with health
   professionals, teachers and parents. This protocol describes the
   rationale, methods and analysis plan for a proposed cluster randomised
   feasibility trial of this RECALL programme. Methods This is a three-arm,
   cluster randomised feasibility trial comparing RECALL to an existing
   programme (active control), and no-intervention (education as usual). We
   will recruit six schools in socially disadvantaged areas in one region
   of the UK. Two schools will be randomly allocated to each arm of the
   trial. In each school, one class of children (ages 4-5 years) of approx.
   30 children will be involved in this study. Ten children in each class
   will be sampled purposefully for outcome measurement including:
   standardised assessments of WM, language and attention skills; teacher
   ratings of attention; and parent ratings of functional communication
   skills. These will be administered at baseline and 1-week
   post-intervention in order to test the acceptability of the measures. A
   process evaluation using semi-structured interviews with participants
   will explore the acceptability of RECALL and the procedures employed in
   this trial. Discussion This feasibility study will explore the
   acceptability of RECALL to the health professionals and teachers who
   will deliver it and inform the optimal design of the programme. The
   inclusion of an active control group and the blinding of outcomes
   assessors enhance rigour in this study. The findings will determine
   whether this study can be scaled-up into a definitive cluster randomised
   trial to evaluate the effectiveness of RECALL.},

Title = {Development of a psychoeducational intervention for people affected by
   pancreatic cancer},

Abstract = {Background Pancreatic cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of
   any malignancy, placing a substantial burden on patients and families
   with high unmet informational and supportive care needs. Nevertheless,
   access to psychosocial and palliative care services for the individuals
   affected is limited. There is a need for standardized approaches to
   facilitate adjustment and to improve knowledge about the disease and its
   anticipated impact. In this intervention-development paper guided by
   implementation science principles, we report the rationale, methods, and
   processes employed in developing an interdisciplinary group
   psychoeducational intervention for people affected by pancreatic cancer.
   The acceptability and feasibility of implementation will be evaluated as
   a part of a subsequent feasibility study. Methods The Schofield and
   Chambers framework for designing sustainable self-management
   interventions in cancer care informed the development of the
   intervention content and format. The Consolidated Framework for
   Implementation Research served as an overarching guide of the
   implementation process, including the development phase and the
   formative evaluation plan of implementation. Results A representative
   team of stakeholders collaboratively developed and tailored the
   intervention content and format with attention to the principles of
   implementation science, including available resourcing. The final
   intervention prototype was designed as a single group-session led by an
   interdisciplinary clinical team with expertise in caring for patients
   with pancreatic cancer and their families and in addressing nutrition
   guidelines, disease and symptom management, communication with family
   and health care providers, family impact of cancer, preparing for the
   future, and palliative and supportive care services. Conclusions The
   present paper describes the development of a group psychoeducational
   intervention to address the informational and supportive care needs of
   people affected by pancreatic cancer. Consideration of implementation
   science during intervention development efforts can optimize uptake and
   sustainability in the clinical setting. Our approach may be utilized as
   a framework for the design and implementation of similar initiatives to
   support people affected by diseases with limited prognoses.},

Title = {Identifying change processes in group-based health behaviour-change
   interventions: development of the mechanisms of action in group-based

Abstract = {Group-based interventions are widely used to promote health-related
   behaviour change. While processes operating in groups have been
   extensively described, it remains unclear how behaviour change is
   generated in group-based health-related behaviour-change interventions.
   Understanding how such interventions facilitate change is important to
   guide intervention design and process evaluations. We employed a
   mixed-methods approach to identify, map and define change processes
   operating in group-based behaviour-change interventions. We reviewed
   multidisciplinary literature on group dynamics, taxonomies of change
   technique categories, and measures of group processes. Using weight-loss
   groups as an exemplar, we also reviewed qualitative studies of
   participants' experiences and coded transcripts of 38 group sessions
   from three weight-loss interventions. Finally, we consulted group
   participants, facilitators and researchers about our developing
   synthesis of findings. The resulting `Mechanisms of Action in
   Group-based Interventions' (MAGI) framework comprises six overarching
   categories: (1) group intervention design features, (2) facilitation
   techniques, (3) group dynamic and development processes, (4)
   inter-personal change processes, (5) selective intra-personal change
   processes operating in groups, and (6) contextual influences. The
   framework provides theoretical explanations of how change occurs in
   group-based behaviour-change interventions and can be applied to
   optimise their design and delivery, and to guide evaluation, facilitator
   training and further research.},

Abstract = {This review assesses the extent of reported theory use in electronic
   health weight management interventions targeting young adults aged 18-35
   years. Twenty-four eligible studies were identified. Two independent
   reviewers extracted data and coded for theory use using the Theory
   Coding Scheme. Overall, the mean total use of theory score was 6/23 (SD
   = 5; Min. = 0, Max. = 17); 17 studies were classified as having weak
   application of theory, five as moderate, and two as strong. The majority
   (N = 18) of studies mentioned theory, however, most (N = 14) did not
   report how intervention techniques related to theoretical base. No study
   used theory to select intervention recipients and only four used theory
   to tailor intervention techniques to recipients. Limited studies
   reported theory testing (N = 6) and no study used intervention results
   to build and/or refine theory. Results indicate that weight-related
   outcomes may be enhanced when at least one or more theoretical
   constructs are explicitly linked to an intervention technique and when
   theoretical constructs are included in evaluations. Increases in theory
   application and reporting are needed to assist the scientific research
   community in systematically identifying which theories work, for whom,
   how, why, and when; thereby delivering an advanced understanding of how
   best to apply theory to enhance intervention outcomes.},

Abstract = {Background A number of children experience difficulties with social
   communication and this has long-term deleterious effects on their mental
   health, social development and education. The proposal presented in this
   article describes a feasibility study for a trial to test an
   intervention ('E-PLAYS') aimed at supporting children with social
   communication impairments. E-PLAYS harnesses technology in the form of a
   novel computer game in order to develop collaborative and communication
   skills. Preliminary studies by the authors show that when E-PLAYS was
   administered by the research team, children with social communication
   impairments showed improvements on communication test scores and on
   observed collaborative behaviours. The study described here is a
   pragmatic trial to test the application of E-PLAYS delivered by NHS
   speech and language therapists together with schools. Methods This
   protocol outlines a two-arm feasibility cluster-randomised controlled
   trial of the E-PLAYS intervention with treatment as usual control arm,
   with randomisation at the level of the speech and language therapist.
   The aim of this study is to ascertain whether it will be feasible to
   progress to running a full-scale definitive trial to test the
   effectiveness of E-PLAYS in an NHS setting. Data relating to recruitment
   and retention, the appropriateness of outcomes and the acceptability of
   E-PLAYS to participants will be collected. Speech and language
   therapists will select suitable children (ages 4-7 years old) from their
   caseloads and deliver either the E-PLAYS intervention (experimental
   group) or treatment as usual (control group). Assessments will include
   blinded language measures and observations, non-blinded teacher-reported
   measures of peer relations and classroom behaviour and parent-reported
   use of resources and quality of life. There will also be a qualitative
   process evaluation. Discussion The findings of this study will inform
   the decision as to whether to progress to a full-scale definitive
   randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness of E-PLAYS when
   delivered by speech and language therapists and teaching assistants
   within schools. The use of technology in game form is a novel approach
   in an area where there are currently few available interventions.},

Title = {The FRAME: an expanded framework for reporting adaptations and
   modifications to evidence-based interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {BackgroundThis paper describes the process and results of a refinement
   of a framework to characterize modifications to interventions. The
   original version did not fully capture several aspects of modification
   and adaptation that may be important to document and report.
   Additionally, the earlier framework did not include a way to
   differentiate cultural adaptation from adaptations made for other
   reasons. Reporting additional elements will allow for a more precise
   understanding of modifications, the process of modifying or adapting,
   and the relationship between different forms of modification and
   subsequent health and implementation outcomes.DiscussionWe employed a
   multifaceted approach to develop the updated FRAME involving coding
   documents identified through a literature review, rapid coding of
   qualitative interviews, and a refinement process informed by multiple
   stakeholders. The updated FRAME expands upon Stirman et al.'s original
   framework by adding components of modification to report: (1) when and
   how in the implementation process the modification was made, (2) whether
   the modification was planned/proactive (i.e., an adaptation) or
   unplanned/reactive, (3) who determined that the modification should be
   made, (4) what is modified, (5) at what level of delivery the
   modification is made, (6) type or nature of context or content-level
   modifications, (7) the extent to which the modification is
   fidelity-consistent, and (8) the reasons for the modification, including
   (a) the intent or goal of the modification (e.g., to reduce costs) and
   (b) contextual factors that influenced the decision. Methods of using
   the framework to assess modifications are outlined, along with their
   strengths and weaknesses, and considerations for research to validate
   these measurement strategies.ConclusionThe updated FRAME includes
   consideration of when and how modifications occurred, whether it was
   planned or unplanned, relationship to fidelity, and reasons and goals
   for modification. This tool that can be used to support research on the
   timing, nature, goals and reasons for, and impact of modifications to
   evidence-based interventions.},

Title = {Community Intervention to Prevent Adolescent Health Behavior Problems:
   Evaluation of Communities That Care in Australia},

Abstract = {Objective: A major challenge for health psychologists is to ensure the
   implementation of evidence-based interventions to improve population
   health. To reduce high rates of adolescent alcohol use and related
   health problems, trials of the Communities That Care (CTC) prevention
   process were implemented in Australia beginning in 2001. The process
   assists communities to strategically plan and monitor implementation of
   evidence-based preventative interventions. This article reports an
   evaluation of the effects in the first four Australian communities that
   completed the process. Method: Trends were examined based on self-report
   surveys completed by 41,328 adolescents (average age 13.5 years, 51.7\%
   female) across 109 municipal localities between 1999 and 2015.
   Multilevel modeling compared the 5 localities where the 4 coalitions
   completed the CTC process with the remaining 104 localities for trends
   in adolescent reports of lifetime alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use and
   past year antisocial behavior. Results: Relative to Australian trends,
   adolescents in CTC localities reported significantly steeper annual
   reductions in any lifetime alcohol (Adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] = 0.94,
   95\% confidence intervals {[}CI] = {[}0.93, 0.95]), tobacco (AOR = 0.97,
   CI {[}0.96, 0.99]), cannabis use (AOR = 0.96, CI {[}0.93, 0.98]) and
   antisocial behavior (unstandardized regression coefficient {[}B] =
   -0.001, CI {[}-0.002, 0.000]). Conclusion: Implementation of the CTC
   process in Australia was associated with more rapid community reductions
   in adolescent health behavior problems. Supporting community coalitions
   to adopt evidence-based interventions appears a feasible means for
   health psychologists to improve the health of large adolescent
   populations and prevent related chronic health problems in later life.},

Abstract = {The benefits of exclusive breastfeeding are well documented, yet few
   women adhere to recommendations. We report the Behaviour Change
   Techniques (BCTs) within interventions trialled internationally after
   pregnancy to promote exclusive and mixed breastfeeding as well as
   evidence of effectiveness. PsycINFO, EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were
   screened. Twenty-three (n = 23) studies met inclusion criteria. Three
   authors independently extracted data, coded interventions using the BCT
   v.1 taxonomy, and assessed study quality. There was a moderate
   significant effect of the interventions promoting exclusive
   breastfeeding up to four weeks postpartum (OR 1.77, {[}95\% CI:
   1.47-2.13]) but this effect slightly declined beyond thirteen weeks (OR
   1.63, {[}95\% CI: 1.07-2.47]). Twenty-nine BCTs were identified within
   interventions. `Credible source' and `instruction on how to perform the
   behaviour' were the most prevalent and `social support (unspecified)'
   contributed to the effectiveness of exclusive breastfeeding
   interventions five to eight weeks postpartum. Using BCTs with cognitive
   and behavioural aspects may help women develop coping mechanisms
   promoting exclusive breastfeeding. Further trials are needed in
   countries with low breastfeeding rates such as the UK. The use of
   programme theory during intervention development and clear description
   of intervention components is recommended. This meta-analysis provides
   guidance for trials evaluating postpartum breastfeeding interventions.},

Abstract = {Background Fun For Wellness (FFW) is an online behavioral intervention
   designed to promote growth in well-being and physical activity by
   providing capability-enhancing learning opportunities to participants.
   The conceptual framework for the FFW intervention is guided by
   self-efficacy theory. Evidence has been provided for the efficacy of FFW
   to promote self-reported free-living physical well-being actions in
   adults who comply with the intervention. The objective of this
   manuscript is to describe the protocol for a feasibility study designed
   to address uncertainties regarding the inclusion of accelerometer-based
   assessment of free-living physical activity within the FFW online
   intervention among adults with obesity in the United States of America
   (USA). Method The study design is a prospective, double-blind, parallel
   group randomized pilot trial. Thirty participants will be randomly
   assigned to the FFW or usual care (UC) group to achieve a 1:1 group
   (i.e., FFW:UC) assignment. Recruitment of participants is scheduled to
   begin on 29 April 2019 at a local bariatric services center within a
   major healthcare organization in the Midwest of the USA. There are five
   eligibility criteria for participation in this study: (1) between 18 and
   64 years old, (2) a body mass index >= 25.00 kg/m(2), (3) ability to
   access the online intervention, (4) the absence of simultaneous
   enrollment in another intervention program promoting physical activity,
   and (5) willingness to comply with instructions for physical activity
   monitoring. Eligibility verification and data collection will be
   conducted online. Three waves of data will be collected over a 13-week
   period. Instruments designed to measure demographic information,
   anthropometric characteristics, acceptability and feasibility of
   accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity, self-efficacy, and
   well-being will be included in the study. Data will be analyzed using
   descriptive statistics (e.g., recruitment rates), Pearson's correlation
   coefficient, Bland-Altman analyses, and inferential statistical models
   under both an intent to treat approach and a complier average causal
   effect approach. Discussion Results are intended to inform the
   preparation of a future definitive randomized controlled trial. Trial

Abstract = {The conceptual basis of early childhood feeding interventions for
   obesity prevention is poorly understood. The aim of this systematic
   review is to characterise these interventions' use of behaviour change
   techniques (BCTs) and psychological theory, focusing on interventions
   delivered by healthcare professionals for children <= 2 years. We
   searched seven electronic databases from inception to January 2019 and
   identified 12 trials. BCTs and theory use were identified using the
   Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1 and the Theory Coding Scheme
   respectively. Interventions used 19 BCTs, most commonly `Instruction on
   how to perform the behaviour' (12 of 12 studies) and `Social support
   (unspecified)' (8 of 12 studies). The mean number of BCTs used was 5.1.
   Six trials explicitly stated basing interventions on theory, most
   commonly social cognitive theory and responsive feeding (4 of 6 studies
   each). Links between theory use and BCTs were poor. Early childhood
   feeding interventions have insufficiently integrated psychological
   theories into their development and evaluation. We recommend greater
   consideration of psychological theory incorporating family and systems
   approaches and responsive feeding in future intervention development.
   Moreover, these theories should explicitly link with BCTs. These
   theories and BCTs should also be included in the evaluation phase.},

Abstract = {Background: While people who are homeless often experience poor mental
   and physical health and problem substance use, getting access to
   appropriate services can be challenging. The development of trusting
   relationships with non-judgemental staff can facilitate initial and
   sustained engagement with health and wider support services.
   Peer-delivered approaches seem to have particular promise, but there is
   limited evidence regarding peer interventions that are both acceptable
   to, and effective for, people who are homeless and using drugs and/or
   alcohol. In the proposed study, we will develop and test the use of a
   peer-to-peer relational intervention with people experiencing
   homelessness. Drawing on the concept of psychologically informed
   environments, it will focus on building trusting and supportive
   relationships and providing practical elements of support such as access
   to primary care, treatment and housing options.
   Methods: A mixed-method feasibility study with concurrent process
   evaluation will be conducted to explore the feasibility and
   acceptability of a peer-delivered, relational intervention for people
   with problem substance use who are homeless. Peer Navigators will be
   based in homelessness outreach and residential services in Scotland and
   England. Peer Navigators will work with a small number of participants
   for up to 12 months providing both practical and emotional support. The
   sample size for the intervention is 60. Those receiving the intervention
   must be currently homeless or at risk of homelessness, over the age of
   18 years and self-report alcohol/drug problems. A holistic health check
   will be conducted in the first few months of the intervention and
   repeated towards the end. Health checks will be conducted by a
   researcher in the service where the Peer Navigator is based.
   Semi-structured qualitative interviews with intervention participants
   and staff in both intervention and standard care settings, and all Peer
   Navigators, will be conducted to explore their experiences with the
   intervention. Non-participant observation will be conducted in
   intervention and standard care sites to document similarities and
   differences between care pathways.
   Discussion: The SHARPS study will provide evidence regarding whether a
   peer-delivered harm reduction intervention is feasible and acceptable to
   people experiencing homelessness and problem substance use in order to
   develop a definitive trial.},

Abstract = {Background Families applying for asylum have often experienced multiple
   potentially traumatic events and continue to face stressors during their
   resettlement. Studies have indicated that traumatic events can
   negatively impact parenting behaviour and child development. A secondary
   preventive multi-family intervention programme, called Family
   Empowerment, was developed. Family Empowerment aims to strengthen
   parenting skills and prevent exacerbation of emotional problems in
   asylum-seeker families. This study protocol aims to evaluate the
   feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of Family
   Empowerment to reduce parental mental health problems and improve family
   functioning. Methods An uncontrolled pre-test-post-test design will be
   conducted, using a mixed-methods approach. Approximately 60 families
   living at asylum centres and family locations with children aged 0-18
   will be included. All participants will be invited to take part in seven
   sessions of Family Empowerment. Measurements take place at baseline,
   during implementation of Family Empowerment and 1 week post-Family
   Empowerment. Demographic data, the quality of the parent-child
   interaction, family functioning, parental symptoms of depression and
   anxiety, and participants' feedback on progress and the therapeutic
   alliance will be assessed. A programme integrity list will be filled out
   during each session. Semi-structured interviews at baseline and
   post-Family Empowerment will be used to evaluate Family Empowerment.
   Discussion This is the first study to provide a pilot implementation and
   evaluation of Family Empowerment. The current study will inform us on
   how to improve programme elements and the implementation of Family
   Empowerment. Limitations are discussed.},

Title = {A web-based carepartner-integrated rehabilitation program for persons
   with stroke: study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Background Family carepartner management and support can improve stroke
   survivor recovery, yet research has placed little emphasis on how to
   integrate families into the rehabilitation process without increasing
   negative carepartner outcomes. Our group has developed creative
   approaches for engaging family carepartners in rehabilitation activities
   to improve physical and psychosocial health for both the carepartner and
   stroke survivor. The purpose of this study is to explore a novel,
   web-based intervention (Carepartner and Constraint-Induced Therapy;
   CARE-CITE) designed to facilitate positive carepartner involvement
   during a home-based application of constraint-induced movement therapy
   (CIMT) for the upper extremity. Methods The primary aim of the study is
   to determine feasibility of CARE-CITE for both stroke survivors and
   their carepartners. Carepartner mental health, family conflict
   surrounding stroke recovery, and stroke survivor upper extremity
   function will be evaluated using an evaluator blinded, two-group
   experimental design (blocked randomization protocol according to a 2:1
   randomization schema) with 32 intervention dyads and 16 control dyads
   (who will receive CIMT without structured carepartner involvement).
   CARE-CITE consists of online education modules for the carepartner to
   review in parallel to the 30-h CIMT that the stroke survivor receives.
   The intent of CARE-CITE is to enhance the home-based intervention of
   CIMT, by helping the carepartner support the therapy and create a
   therapeutic home environment encouraging practice of the weaker arm in
   functional tasks. Discussion The CARE-CITE study is testing the
   feasibility of a family-integrated rehabilitation approach applied in
   the home environment, and results will provide the foundation for larger
   clinical studies. The overall significance of this research plan is to
   increase the understanding and further development of interventions that
   may serve as models to promote family involvement in the rehabilitation
   process.},

Abstract = {Objective: There is powerful evidence that changing people's
   health-related behavior can impact the leading causes of mortality and
   morbidity. However, despite the significant potential to improve health
   and clinical outcomes, behavior change interventions frequently fall
   short of expected reach or impact. Method: Stakeholder engagement, which
   refers to the active involvement of public, patients, health
   professionals, and other decision makers throughout the research
   process, has been proposed as a strategy to improve the quality, reach,
   and impact of research. A user-centered ``reverse translation{''}
   approach makes it more likely that behavior change interventions are
   relevant to users' needs, better designed, more likely to be
   implemented, and, ultimately, more effective. Results: In this article,
   the key concepts of stakeholder engagement are introduced and critically
   evaluated. Three studies, providing examples of stakeholder engagement,
   are described and critically evaluated. These include (1) a research
   prioritization project that sought the views of people with diabetes,
   services providers, and policy makers to identify research priorities in
   behavioral diabetes research; (2) a ``core outcome set{''} study, in
   which consensus methods were used to identify outcomes considered
   important by patients and health professionals for trials of
   interventions targeting self-management among young adults with Type 1
   diabetes; and (3) an intervention development study, where the
   intervention targeting self-management among young adults with Type 1
   diabetes was coproduced with input from members of a ``young adult
   panel.{''} Conclusions: While stakeholder engagement appears promising
   as a strategy to increase the impact of behavior change research,
   evidence is sparse and more guidance, tools, and training are needed.},

Title = {Using implementation facilitation to implement primary care mental
   health integration via clinical video telehealth in rural clinics:

Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {BackgroundIntegrating mental health providers into primary care clinics
   improves access to and outcomes of mental health care. In the Veterans
   Health Administration (VA) Primary Care Mental Health Integration
   (PCMHI) program, mental health providers are co-located in primary care
   clinics, but the implementation of this model is challenging outside
   large VA medical centers, especially for rural clinics without full
   mental health staffing. Long wait times for mental health care, little
   collaboration between mental health and primary care providers, and
   sub-optimal outcomes for rural veterans could result. Telehealth could
   be used to provide PCMHI to rural clinics; however, the clinical
   effectiveness of the tele-PCMHI model has not been tested. Based on
   evidence that implementation facilitation is an effective implementation
   strategy to increase uptake of PCMHI when delivered on-site at larger VA
   clinics, it is hypothesized that this strategy may also be effective
   with regard to ensuring adequate uptake of the tele-PCMHI model at rural
   VA clinics.MethodsThis study is a hybrid type 2 pragmatic
   effectiveness-implementation trial of tele-PCMHI in six sites over
   24months. Tele-PCMHI, which will be delivered by clinical staff
   available in routine care settings, will be compared to usual care.
   Fidelity to the care model will be monitored but not controlled. We will
   use the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM)
   framework to evaluate the patient-level clinical effectiveness of
   tele-PCMHI in rural VA clinics and also to evaluate the fidelity to and
   outcomes of the implementation strategy, implementation facilitation.
   The proposed study will employ a stepped-wedge design in which study
   sites sequentially begin implementation in three steps at 6-month
   intervals. Each step will include (1) a 6-month period of implementation
   planning, followed by (2) a 6-month period of active implementation, and
   (3) a final period of stepped-down implementation
   facilitation.DiscussionThis study will evaluate the effectiveness of
   PCMHI in a novel setting and via a novel method (clinical video
   telehealth). We will test the feasibility of using implementation
   facilitation as an implementation strategy to deploy tele-PCMHI in rural
   VA clinics.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov registration number

Title = {An active play intervention to improve physical activity and fundamental
   movement skills in children of low socio-economic status: feasibility
   cluster randomised controlled trial},

Abstract = {Introduction Active play is a novel approach to addressing low physical
   activity levels and fundamental movement skills (FMS) in childhood and
   new interventions must be developed and evaluated. Aim This study aimed
   to determine the feasibility of a 10-week school-based `active play'
   intervention, and present preliminary findings on four outcomes:
   physical activity levels, FMS, inhibition, and maths fluency. Methods
   This was a feasibility cluster RCT in which eight schools (one primary
   three class per school) were paired and randomly allocated to either the
   10-week intervention (n = 4) or waiting-list control (n = 4). The active
   play intervention consisted of a 1-h outdoor physical activity session
   per week, incorporating 30 min of facilitated games and 30 min of free
   play. Feasibility measures were gathered using appropriate methods and
   physical activity was measured using an ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer,
   FMS were assessed using the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 (TGMD-2),
   inhibition was measured using a Flanker Test and maths fluency was
   assessed using the One Minute Basic Number Facts Test. Results Sixty-six
   percent of eligible children (n = 137) agreed to participate in the
   research. No schools withdrew from the study and three participants were
   lost to follow-up. Compliance to the intervention was high-none of the
   participants missed more than two of the ten scheduled active play
   sessions. Data lost to follow-up were minimal; most were lost (14\%) for
   school day physical activity. Active play sessions were shorter than
   planned on average by 10 min, and participants spent a mean of 39.4\%
   (14.2) of the session time in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical
   activity (MVPA). There was preliminary evidence of a small intervention
   effect on MVPA (d = 0.3), FMS score (d = 0.4), inhibition (fish trial: d
   = 0.1, arrow trial d = 0.1) and maths fluency (addition: d = 0.3,
   subtraction: d = 0.1). Conclusion The active play intervention was
   feasible and benefitted from a relatively high MVPA content; however,
   preliminary findings suggest the intervention had a small effect on the
   outcomes. Having more active play sessions per week and/or extending the
   duration of the intervention may increase the effects and these should
   be tested before a future definitive cluster RCT is undertaken.},

Abstract = {BackgroundAlignment across levels of leadership within an organization
   is needed for successful implementation of evidence-based practice. The
   leadership and organizational change for implementation (LOCI)
   intervention is a multi-faceted multilevel implementation strategy
   focusing on enhancing first-level general and implementation leadership
   while also engaging with organization upper management to develop an
   organizational climate for implementation. The aim of the project is to
   evaluate the effectiveness of LOCI in supporting the implementation of
   evidence-based treatment for PTSD in child- and adult-specialized mental
   health clinics in health trusts in Norway.MethodsThe study design is a
   stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial with enrollment of clinics in
   three cohorts. Executives, clinic leaders, and therapists will be asked
   to complete surveys assessing leadership and implementation climate.
   Surveys will be completed at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20months.
   Results from surveys will be shared with executives and clinic leaders
   to inform the subsequent creation of tailored leadership and climate
   development plans for enhanced implementation. Patients will complete
   surveys measuring traumatic events and post-traumatic stress symptoms
   during the therapy process. Therapy sessions will be audio or video
   recorded and scored for fidelity as part of training.DiscussionThis
   study aims to provide knowledge on how to improve leadership and
   organizational climate to enhance effective implementation of
   evidence-based treatments in mental health services.Trial

Abstract = {Background Interventions need to be developed prior to the feasibility
   and piloting phase of a study. There are a variety of published
   approaches to developing interventions, programmes or innovations to
   improve health. Identifying different types of approach, and
   synthesising the range of actions taken within this endeavour, can
   inform future intervention development. Methods This study is a
   systematic methods overview of approaches to intervention development.
   Approaches were considered for inclusion if they described how to
   develop or adapt an intervention in a book, website or journal article
   published after 2007, or were cited in a primary research study
   reporting the development of a specific intervention published in 2015
   or 2016. Approaches were read, a taxonomy of approaches was developed
   and the range of actions taken across different approaches were
   synthesised. Results Eight categories of approach to intervention
   development were identified. (1) Partnership, where people who will use
   the intervention participate equally with the research team in
   decision-making about the intervention throughout the development
   process. (2) Target population-centred, where the intervention is based
   on the views and actions of the people who will use it. (3) Evidence and
   theory-based, where the intervention is based on published research
   evidence and existing theories. (4) Implementation-based, where the
   intervention is developed with attention to ensuring it will be used in
   the real world. (5) Efficiency-based, where components of an
   intervention are tested using experimental designs to select components
   which will optimise efficiency. (6) Stepped or phased, where
   interventions are developed with an emphasis on following a systematic
   set of processes. (7) Intervention-specific, where an approach is
   constructed for a specific type of intervention. (8) Combination, where
   existing approaches to intervention development are formally combined.
   The actions from approaches in all eight categories were synthesised to
   identify 18 actions to consider when developing interventions.
   Conclusions This overview of approaches to intervention development can
   help researchers to understand the variety of existing approaches, and
   to understand the range of possible actions involved in intervention
   development, prior to assessing feasibility or piloting the
   intervention. Findings from this overview will contribute to future
   guidance on intervention development.},

Abstract = {Background: While it is recommended that childcare services implement
   policies and practices to support obesity prevention, there remains
   limited evidence to inform policy and practice. The aim of this study is
   to examine the effectiveness of performance review and facilitated
   feedback in increasing the implementation of healthy eating and physical
   activity-promoting policies and practices in childcare services.
   Methods: The study was conducted with childcare services in the Hunter
   New England region of New South Wales, Australia. Eligible services were
   randomised to a wait-list control group or to receive the implementation
   strategy. The strategy targeted the implementation of written nutrition,
   physical activity, and small screen recreation policies; providing
   information to families regarding healthy eating, physical activity, and
   small screen time; providing twice weekly healthy eating learning
   experiences to children; providing water and plain milk only to
   children; providing fundamental movement skills activities for children
   every day; and limiting the use of electronic screen time for
   educational purposes and learning experiences. Intervention services
   received a performance review and facilitated feedback process five
   times over the 10 months that included an assessment of current
   practices, goal setting, identification of barriers to implementation,
   problem-solving, and resource provision. The primary outcome was the
   proportion of services implementing all six policies and practices,
   assessed by nominated supervisor completion of a computer-assisted
   telephone interview at baseline and 12-month follow-up.
   Results: One hundred and eight services took part. There were no
   significant differences in the proportion of services implementing all
   six practices at 12 months (mean difference 0.51; 95\% CI 0.16 to 1.58;
   p = 0.24). There were also no differences between groups in the mean
   number of policies and practices implemented (mean difference 0.1; 95\%
   CI -0.4 to 0.6; p = 0.71), or the proportion implementing each of the
   six individual policies and practices at 12 months (OR range 0.57 to
   1.85; p > 0.05).
   Conclusions: Further support may be required to assist childcare
   services to make recommended changes to their policies and practices.},

Abstract = {Background There is a need for high-quality research aiming to increase
   physical activity in families. This study assessed the feasibility and
   acceptability of FRESH (Families Reporting Every Step to Health), a
   child-led family-based physical activity intervention delivered online.
   Methods In a two-armed randomised feasibility study, 12 families (with
   an 8-10-year-old index child) were allocated to a `child-only' (CO) or
   `family' arm (FAM) of the theory-based FRESH intervention. Both received
   access to the FRESH website, allowing participants to select step
   challenges to `travel' to target cities around the world, log their
   steps, and track their progress as they virtually globetrot. Only index
   children wore pedometers in CO; in FAM, all family members wore
   pedometers and worked towards collective goals. All family members were
   eligible to participate in the evaluation. Mixed-methods process
   evaluation (questionnaires and family focus groups) at 6-week follow-up
   consisted of completing questionnaires assessing acceptability of the
   intervention and accompanying effectiveness evaluation, focussed on
   physical (e.g. fitness, blood pressure), psychosocial (e.g. social
   support), and behavioural (e.g. objectively-measured family physical
   activity) measures. Results All families were retained (32
   participants). Parents enjoyed FRESH and all children found it fun. More
   FAM children wanted to continue with FRESH, found the website easy to
   use, and enjoyed wearing pedometers. FAM children also found it easier
   to reach goals. Most CO families would have preferred whole family
   participation. Compared to CO, FAM exhibited greater website engagement
   as they travelled to more cities (36 +/- 11 vs. 13 +/- 8) and failed
   fewer challenges (1.5 +/- 1 vs. 3 +/- 1). Focus groups also revealed
   that most families wanted elements of competition. All children enjoyed
   being part of the evaluation, and adults disagreed that there were too
   many intervention measures (overall, 2.4 +/- 1.3) or that data
   collection took too long (overall, 2.2 +/- 1.1). Conclusion FRESH was
   feasible and acceptable to participating families; however, findings
   favoured the FAM group. Recruitment, intervention fidelity and delivery
   and some measurement procedures are particular areas that require
   further attention for optimisation. Testing the preliminary
   effectiveness of FRESH on family physical activity is a necessary next
   step.},

Abstract = {Background Studies have shown that supporting parents in pediatric
   oncology reduces family distress following a cancer diagnosis.
   Manualized programs for parents have therefore been developed to reduce
   family distress. However, these programs have limitations that need to
   be improved, such as better defining programs' procedures, developing
   interventions focusing on parents' conjugal relationship, conducting
   rigorous evaluations of implementation, and proposing adaptations to
   various cultural dimensions. According to the Obesity-Related Behavioral
   Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model for the development of behavioral
   intervention, we improved these limitations and developed TAKING BACK
   CONTROL TOGETHER, a six in-person intervention sessions to support
   parents of children with cancer by taking the active components of two
   programs: Bright IDEAS and SCCIP. Referring to the redesign phase of the
   ORBIT model, this study aims to refine the definition of this program's
   design by interviewing parents and healthcare professionals. Methods In
   order to refine the program, we used a sequential mixed-methods study.
   Parents and healthcare professionals first completed questionnaires
   assessing the program, and then discussed its limitations, benefits, and
   areas for improvement in group and/or individual interviews. We
   performed a descriptive thematic content analysis of the qualitative
   data from the open-ended questions (questionnaires and interviews) with
   NVivo 11 to categorize recommendations for the program refinement.
   Results The results showed that components seemed pertinent to final
   users. The main areas needing improvement were the level of complexity
   and understandability of the parent manual, the possibility to choose
   the place and time of the intervention, and the lack of ethnic/cultural
   diversity. Changes to the program were made accordingly. Conclusions It
   is necessary to include end-users when developing complex intervention
   programs designed for vulnerable populations and sensitive clinical
   contexts. Following the present refinement, we now have a treatment
   package, which is safe and acceptable for the target population and has
   a better chance of yielding a clinically significant benefit for users
   in a future pilot study.},

Abstract = {Background Psychoeducation is included in the Norwegian national
   guidelines for treatment of adult ADHD. Despite some promising results
   for the treatment of other conditions and ADHD, little is known about
   the efficacy of such interventions. This paper presents a protocol for a
   pilot randomized controlled trial featuring a psychoeducational group
   program for patients with ADHD. The main objective of this pilot trial
   is to investigate adherence, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a
   ten-session psychoeducational group designed to address specific
   challenges faced by adults diagnosed with ADHD. Methods This pilot study
   will evaluate patient satisfaction and preliminary efficacy of a
   psychoeducational group treatment using a randomized waitlist-controlled
   trial at two different outpatient clinics in mid-Norway. All
   participants will receive treatment as usual, concomitant with the
   intervention and waitlist period. Client satisfaction (CSQ 8), general
   self-efficacy (GSE-6), ADHD-related quality of life (AAQoL), symptoms of
   ADHD (SCL-9; ASRS), and work participation will be assessed at the time
   of recruitment prior to randomization (T0), pre-intervention (T1),
   post-intervention (T2), and at 10 weeks follow-up (T3). Recruitment and
   dropout rates along with treatment adherence will also be evaluated.
   Discussion This study offers valuable insight into the preliminary
   efficacy of educational programs implemented in outpatient clinics. The
   aim of the trial is to evaluate adherence, feasibility, patient
   satisfaction, and the preliminary efficacy of a psychoeducational group
   intervention for patients with adult ADHD and provide further insight
   into the design and construction of a large-scale trial. The results
   also offer preliminary empirical evidence to inform the development of
   larger and more complex studies.},

Abstract = {Background: Dating and relationship violence (DRV)-intimate partner
   violence during adolescence-encompasses physical, sexual and emotional
   abuse. DRV is associated with a range of adverse health outcomes
   including injuries, sexually transmitted infections, adolescent
   pregnancy and mental health issues. Experiencing DRV also predicts both
   victimisation and perpetration of partner violence in adulthood.
   Prevention targeting early adolescence is important because this is when
   dating behaviours begin, behavioural norms become established and DRV
   starts to manifest. Despite high rates of DRV victimisation in England,
   from 22 to 48\% among girls and 12 to 27\% among boys ages 14-17 who
   report intimate relationships, no RCTs of DRV prevention programmes have
   taken place in the UK. Informed by two school-based interventions that
   have shown promising results in RCTs in the USA-Safe Dates and Shifting
   Boundaries-Project Respect aims to optimise and pilot a DRV prevention
   programme for secondary schools in England.
   Methods: Design: optimisation and pilot cluster RCT. Trial will include
   a process evaluation and assess the feasibility of conducting a phase
   III RCT with embedded economic evaluation. Cognitive interviewing will
   inform survey development. Participants: optimisation involves four
   schools and pilot RCT involves six (four intervention, two control). All
   are secondary schools in England. Baseline surveys conducted with
   students in years 8 and 9 (ages 12-14). Follow-up surveys conducted with
   the same cohort, 16 months post-baseline. Optimisation sessions to
   inform intervention and research methods will involve consultations with
   stakeholders, including young people. Intervention: school staff
   training, including guidance on reviewing school policies and addressing
   `hotspots' for DRV and gender-based harassment; information for parents;
   informing students of a help-seeking app; and a classroom curriculum for
   students in years 9 and 10, including a student-led campaign. Primary
   outcome: the primary outcome of the pilot RCT will be whether
   progression to a phase III RCT is justified. Testing within the pilot
   will also determine which of two existing scales is optimal for
   assessing DRV victimisation and perpetration in a phase III RCT.
   Discussion: This will be the first RCT of an intervention to prevent DRV
   in the UK. If findings indicate feasibility and acceptability, we will
   undertake planning for a phase III RCT of effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Background: People with serious mental illness (SMI) have poorer
   physical health and reduced lifespans compared to the general
   population. Reasons for this are complex, but one important area is the
   identification and treatment of physical health conditions. In England,
   services are structured into primary and secondary care; physical and
   mental secondary health services are separate. This often leads to a
   lack of co-ordination of care, with people missing the screening and
   treatment they need. People with SMI may find accessing physical health
   services more difficult due to the impact of their symptoms and/or a
   lack of social support. When they do access physical care, there may be
   `diagnostic overshadowing' where physical health concerns are put down
   to a mental health diagnosis. Creating tools to support people with SMI
   to assume more control of their physical health may help to ameliorate
   some of these problems. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of
   a service user-held Physical health plan (PHP) for secondary mental
   health service users to determine whether its use increases uptake of
   physical health services.
   Methods: We will undertake a pilot quality improvement (QI) study to
   test the use of the PHP. The development of the PHP is described. A
   Theory of Change (ToC) has been developed which we will test to
   understand how the PHP is used, using focus groups at the beginning of
   the study. We will then pilot the use of the PHP for 6 months in two
   community mental health teams to find out how people use it, what
   actions are taken, and if it increases uptake of physical health care.
   We will use the RE-AIM implementation framework to guide the evaluation.
   After the pilot, we will undertake interviews with service users and
   clinical staff to elicit their views on using the PHP.
   Discussion: This study uses QI methodology and an implementation
   framework to test a novel intervention for people with SMI. If
   successful, the intervention will support people with SMI to access
   physical health services. The study will inform the design of a
   larger-scale definitive RCT.},

Title = {Intermediary/purveyor organizations for evidence-based interventions in

Abstract = {BackgroundMany psychosocial interventions are disseminated and supported
   by organizations, termed Intermediary/Purveyor Organizations (IPOs).
   Because IPOs remain largely unstudied, we lack understanding of their
   scale and the strategies they utilize. The role and function of
   organizations that link resource systems with user systems, such as
   IPOs, have been identified as an important but understudied issue in
   implementation science. The objectives of this paper are to describe
   features of IPOs that disseminate evidence-based interventions (EBIs)
   for child behavioral health and identify the strategies they use to
   support their implementation.MethodsThe Substance Abuse and Mental
   Health Services (SAMHSA) National Registry of Evidence-based Programs
   and Practices (NREPP) listed 119 unique IPOs for the 127 child
   behavioral health EBIs listed on its website. Data characterizing each
   organization were drawn from NREPP and GuideStar profiles. From 119
   unique IPOs identified, we found contact information for 108. We sent an
   electronic survey to capture additional organizational information and
   implementation strategies the IPOs employed in spreading the EBIs;
   response rate was 50\%. Data are presented descriptively and analyzed
   using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and Latent Class Analysis
   (LCA).ResultsVirtually all identified EBIs had an IPO. IPOs train
   individuals, organizations, and communities and provide supervision for
   the use of EBIs. About 20\% of IPOs trained at large scale, some
   training 500-1000+ providers annually. IPOs reported using an average of
   32 distinct strategies to implement their EBIs, with most using
   educational, planning, and quality improvement strategies. However,
   there was little convergence around strategy helpfulness. The only
   significant predictor of number of strategies used by an IPO was the
   NREPP-posted implementation readiness score of the intervention. LCA
   revealed that IPOs either used several implementation strategies or used
   very few.ConclusionsFindings add significantly to knowledge about IPO
   structure, scale, and function. They use numerous and varying
   implementation strategies but report little consensus in what works. The
   study advances methods for measuring and characterizing real-world
   implementation by demonstrating the feasibility of using a common
   nomenclature, per a published compilation and of LCA for data reduction
   in characterizing profiles of implementation approaches.},

Abstract = {A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of the techniques
   used to promote psychological need satisfaction and motivation within
   health interventions based on self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan \&
   Deci, 2017. Self-determination theory: Basic psychological needs in
   motivation, development, and wellness. New York, NY: Guilford Press).
   Eight databases were searched from 1970 to 2017. Studies including a
   control group and reporting pre- and post-intervention ratings of
   SDT-related psychosocial mediators (namely perceived autonomy support,
   need satisfaction and motivation) with children or adults were included.
   Risk of bias was assessed using items from the Cochrane risk of bias
   tool. 2496 articles were identified of which 74 met inclusion criteria;
   80\% were RCTs or cluster RCTs. Techniques to promote need supportive
   environments were coded according to two established taxonomies (BCTv1
   and MIT), and 21 SDT-specific techniques, and grouped into 18 SDT based
   strategies. Weighted mean effect sizes were computed using a random
   effects model; perceived autonomy support g = 0.84, autonomy g = 0.81,
   competence g = 0.63, relatedness g = 0.28, and motivation g = 0.41.
   One-to-one interventions resulted in greater competence satisfaction
   than group-based (g = 0.96 vs. 0.28), and competence satisfaction was
   greater for adults (g = 0.95) than children (g = 0.11). Meta-regression
   analysis showed that individual strategies had limited independent
   impact on outcomes, endorsing the suggestion that a need supportive
   environment requires the combination of multiple co-acting techniques.},

Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of
   physical activity (in both descriptive and intervention studies) on
   health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents from
   both healthy and chronic illness populations. Method: A systematic
   review of PubMed, PsycINFO, and ProQuest identified 33 studies of
   physical activity and HRQOL in youth, including descriptive and prepost
   intervention designs. Results: In descriptive studies (N = 14), there
   was a small, positive association between physical activity and HRQOL
   based on child-reports (Hedges' g = .302, p < .001, 95\% confidence
   interval, CI {[}.178, .426]) and a negligible association based on
   parent-proxy reports (Hedges' g = .115, p = .101, 95\% CI {[}-.023,
   .253]). Intervention studies (N = 19) yielded a small, positive effect
   of physical activity intervention on HRQOL based on child-reports
   (Hedges' g = .279, p = .014, 95\% CI {[}.057, .500]) and a medium,
   positive effect based on parent-proxy reports (Hedges' g = .522, p =
   .012, 95\% CI {[}.117, .928]). Intervention effects were attenuated by
   removal of a single study. Hypothesized and exploratory moderators did
   not moderate the relationship between physical activity and HRQOL.
   Conclusions: Findings supported the primary hypothesis that physical
   activity was related to better HRQOL in youth, although the magnitude of
   these effects did not represent a minimal clinically important
   difference (MCID) in most studies. Future studies are needed to assess
   HRQOL in youth before and after exercise interventions to quantify the
   type, frequency, duration, and intensity of physical activity needed to
   change HRQOL.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim was to describe the early phases of the progressive
   development of a lifestyle treatment for sustained remission of the
   metabolic syndrome (MetS) using the Obesity-Related Behavioral
   Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model for behavioral treatment development
   as a guide. Methods: Early discovery and design phases produced a
   3-component (diet, physical activity, stress), group-based lifestyle
   treatment with an intensive 6-month phase followed by monthly,
   participant-led maintenance meetings. In the proof-of-concept phase, 26
   participants with the MetS (age 53 +/- 7 years, 77\% female, and 65\%
   ethnic minority) were recruited in a quasi-experimental design to
   determine if treatment could achieve the prespecified benchmark of MetS
   remission in >= 50\% at 2.5 years. Exploratory outcomes focused on MetS
   components, weight, and patient-centered benefits on energy/vitality and
   psychosocial status. Results: MetS remission was achieved in 53.8\%
   after a median of 2.5 years. At 2.5 years, an increase of + 15.4\%
   reported eating >= 3 servings of vegetables/day, + 7.7\% engaged in >=
   150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity/week; and + 11.5\%
   reported experiencing no depression in the past 2 weeks. Weight loss >=
   5\% was achieved by 38.5\%, and energy/vitality, negative affect, and
   social support improved. Median group attendance over 2.5 years was
   73.8\%. Conclusions: It is plausible that this lifestyle program can
   produce a remission in the MetS, sustained through 2.5 years. After
   refinements to enhance precision and strength, progression to
   feasibility pilot testing and a randomized clinical trial will determine
   its efficacy as a cost-effective lifestyle option for managing the MetS
   in the current health care system.},

Title = {Developing an evidence-based program sustainability training curriculum:
   a group randomized, multi-phase approach},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Background: The emergence of dissemination and implementation (D\&I)
   science has driven a rapid increase in studies of how new scientific
   discoveries are translated and developed into evidence-based programs
   and policies. However, D\&I science has paid much less attention to what
   happens to programs once they have been implemented. Public health
   programs can only deliver benefits if they reach maturity and sustain
   activities over time. In order to achieve the full benefits of
   significant investment in public health research and program
   development, there must be an understanding of the factors that relate
   to sustainability to inform development of tools and trainings to
   support strategic long-term program sustainability. Tobacco control
   programs, specifically, vary in their abilities to support and sustain
   themselves over time. As of 2018, most states still do not meet the
   CDC-recommended level for funding their TC program, allowing tobacco use
   to remain the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the USA.
   The purpose of this study is to empirically develop, test, and
   disseminate training programs to improve the sustainability of
   evidence-based state tobacco control programs and thus, tobacco-related
   health outcomes.
   Methods: This paper describes the methods of a group randomized,
   multi-phase study that evaluates the empirically developed ``Program
   Sustainability Action Planning Training{''} and technical assistance in
   US state-level tobacco control programs. Phase 1 includes developing the
   sustainability action planning training curriculum and technical
   assistance protocol and developing measures to assess long-term program
   sustainability. Phase 2 includes a group randomized trial to test the
   effectiveness of the training and technical assistance in improving
   sustainability outcomes in 24 state tobacco control programs (12
   intervention, 12 comparison). Phase 3 includes the active dissemination
   of final training curricula materials to a broader public health
   audience.
   Discussion: Empirical evidence has established that program
   sustainability can improve through training and technical assistance;
   however, to our knowledge, no evidence-based sustainability training
   curriculum program exists. Therefore, systematic methods are needed to
   develop, test, and disseminate a training that improves the
   sustainability of evidence-based programs.},

Title = {Protocol for the ROSE sustainment (ROSES) study, a sequential multiple
   assignment randomized trial to determine the minimum necessary
   intervention to maintain a postpartum depression prevention program in
   prenatal clinics serving low-income women},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Background: More research on sustainment of interventions is needed,
   especially return on investment (ROI) studies to determine cost-benefit
   trade-offs for effort required to sustain and how much is gained when
   effective programs are sustained. The ROSE sustainment (ROSES) study
   uses a sequential multiple assignment randomized (SMART) design to
   evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a stepwise approach
   to sustainment of the ROSE postpartum depression prevention program in
   90 outpatient clinics providing prenatal care to pregnant women on
   public assistance. Postpartum depression (PPD) is common and can have
   lasting consequences. Outpatient clinics offering prenatal care are an
   opportune place to provide PPD prevention because most women visit while
   pregnant The ROSE (Reach Out Stay Strong, Essentials for mothers of
   newborns) program is a group educational intervention to prevent PPD,
   delivered during pregnancy. ROSE has been found to reduce cases of PPD
   in community prenatal settings serving low-income pregnant women.
   Methods: All 90 prenatal clinics will receive enhanced implementation as
   usual (EIAU; initial training + tools for sustainment). At the first
   time at which a clinic is determined to be at risk for failure to
   sustain (i.e., at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months), that clinic will be
   randomized to receive either (1) no additional implementation support
   (i.e., EIAU only), or (2) low-intensity coaching and feedback (LICF). If
   clinics receiving LICF are still at risk at subsequent assessments, they
   will be randomized to either (1) EIAU + LICF only, or (2) high-intensity
   coaching and feedback (HICF). Additional follow-up interviews will occur
   at 18, 24, and 30 months, but no implementation intervention will occur
   after 18 months. Outcomes include (1) percent sustainment of core
   program elements at each time point (2) health impact (PPD rates over
   time at each clinic) and reach, and (3) ROI (costs and
   cost-effectiveness) of each sustainment step. Hypothesized mechanisms
   include sustainment of capacity to deliver core elements and
   engagement/ownership.
   Discussion: This study is the first randomized trial evaluating the ROI
   of a stepped approach to sustainment a critical unanswered question in
   implementation science. It will also a dvance knowledge of
   implementation mechanisms and clinical care for an at-risk population.},

Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Background: Despite clinical guideline recommendations, implementation
   of antenatal care addressing alcohol consumption by pregnant women is
   limited. Implementation strategies addressing barriers to such care may
   be effective in increasing care provision. The aim of this study is to
   examine the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of a
   multi-strategy practice change intervention in increasing antenatal care
   addressing the consumption of alcohol by pregnant women.
   Methods: The study will be a randomised, stepped-wedge controlled trial
   conducted in three sectors in a health district in New South Wales,
   Australia. Stepped implementation of a practice change intervention will
   be delivered to sectors in a random order to support the introduction of
   a model of care for addressing alcohol consumption by pregnant women. A
   staged process was undertaken to develop the implementation strategies,
   which comprise of: leadership support, local clinical practice
   guidelines, electronic prompts and reminders, opinion leaders, academic
   detailing (audit and feedback), educational meetings and educational
   materials, and performance monitoring. Repeated cross-sectional outcome
   data will be gathered weekly across all sectors for the study duration.
   The primary outcome measures are the proportion of antenatal
   appointments at `booking in', 27-28 weeks gestation and 35-36 weeks
   gestation for which women report (1) being assessed for alcohol
   consumption, (2) being provided with brief advice related to alcohol
   consumption during pregnancy, (3) receiving relevant care for addressing
   alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and (4) being assessed for alcohol
   consumption and receiving relevant care. Data on resources expended
   during intervention development and implementation will be collected.
   The proportion of women who report consuming alcohol since knowing they
   were pregnant will be measured as a secondary outcome.
   Discussion: This will be the first randomised controlled trial to
   evaluate the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of
   implementation strategies in improving antenatal care that addresses
   alcohol consumption by pregnant women. If positive changes in clinical
   practice are found, this evidence will support health service adoption
   of implementation strategies to support improved antenatal care for this
   recognised risk to the health and wellbeing of the mother and child.},

Title = {Exercise-Specific Volition and Motivation for Weight Loss Maintenance
   Following an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention},

Abstract = {Objective: The present study investigated the influence of
   exercise-specific motivation and volition on weight loss maintenance
   following an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI). Method: The study
   participants were 164 individuals with obesity (body mass index {[}BMI]
   > 30 kg/m(2)) that participated in an ILI. Participants'
   exercise-specific volition and motivation were assessed before and after
   the intervention as well as 3 and 12 months after completion. Volition
   was measured with the Volition in Exercise Questionnaire and motivation
   was measured with the context translated Sport Motivation Scale.
   Results: Mixed model analysis revealed that when adjusting for gender,
   age, and education, the 6 volitional scales and intrinsic motivation
   predicted BMI across the 4 time points, whereas 6 volitional scales and
   2 extrinsic regulation scales showed a time interaction. Backward
   elimination multiple mixed model analysis revealed that Volitional
   Inhibition - Postponing Training and Volitional Facilitation -
   Self-Confidence predicted BMI development, whereas Volitional Inhibition
   - Unrelated Thoughts, Identified Regulation. and Introjected Regulation
   showed a time interaction above and beyond the other scales. Conclusion:
   Exercise-specific volition and motivation influence weight loss
   maintenance following an ILI. Volitional self-confidence and the
   tendency to postpone training are of importance above and beyond the
   previously identified predictor of autonomous exercise motivation.
   Results of the study also indicate that extrinsic motivation can be
   either facilitating or counterproductive depending on the level of
   self-determination.},

Title = {Using Normalization Process Theory in feasibility studies and process
   evaluations of complex healthcare interventions: a systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Background: Normalization Process Theory (NPT) identifies, characterises
   and explains key mechanisms that promote and inhibit the implementation,
   embedding and integration of new health techniques, technologies and
   other complex interventions. A large body of literature that employs NPT
   to inform feasibility studies and process evaluations of complex
   healthcare interventions has now emerged. The aims of this review were
   to review this literature; to identify and characterise the uses and
   limits of NPT in research on the implementation and integration of
   healthcare interventions; and to explore NPT's contribution to
   understanding the dynamics of these processes.
   Methods: A qualitative systematic review was conducted. We searched Web
   of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar for articles with empirical data
   in peer-reviewed journals that cited either key papers presenting and
   developing NPT, or the NPT Online Toolkit
   (www.normalizationprocess.org). We included in the review only articles
   that used NPT as the primary approach to collection, analysis or
   reporting of data in studies of the implementation of healthcare
   techniques, technologies or other interventions. A structured data
   extraction instrument was used, and data were analysed qualitatively.
   Results: Searches revealed 3322 citations. We show that after
   eliminating 2337 duplicates and broken or junk URLs, 985 were screened
   as titles and abstracts. Of these, 101 were excluded because they did
   not fit the inclusion criteria for the review. This left 884 articles
   for full-text screening. Of these, 754 did not fit the inclusion
   criteria for the review. This left 130 papers presenting results from
   108 identifiable studies to be included in the review. NPT appears to
   provide researchers and practitioners with a conceptual vocabulary for
   rigorous studies of implementation processes. It identifies,
   characterises and explains empirically identifiable mechanisms that
   motivate and shape implementation processes. Taken together, these mean
   that analyses using NPT can effectively assist in the explanation of the
   success or failure of specific implementation projects. Ten percent of
   papers included critiques of some aspect of NPT, with those that did
   mainly focusing on its terminology. However, two studies critiqued NPT
   emphasis on agency, and one study critiqued NPT for its normative focus.
   Conclusions: This review demonstrates that researchers found NPT useful
   and applied it across a wide range of interventions. It has been
   effectively used to aid intervention development and implementation
   planning as well as evaluating and understanding implementation
   processes themselves. In particular, NPT appears to have offered a
   valuable set of conceptual tools to aid understanding of implementation
   as a dynamic process.},

Title = {``I had to somehow still be flexible{''}: exploring adaptations during
   implementation of brief cognitive behavioral therapy in primary care},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Background: Primary care clinics present challenges to implementing
   evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) for depression and anxiety, and
   frontline providers infrequently adopt these treatments. The current
   study explored providers' perspectives on fidelity to a manualized brief
   cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as delivered in primary care clinics
   as part of a pragmatic randomized trial. Data from the primary study
   demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of the treatment and indicated
   that providers delivered brief CBT with high fidelity, as evaluated by
   experts using a standardized rating form. Data presented here explore
   challenges providers faced during implementation and how they adapted
   nonessential intervention components to make the protocol ``fit{''} into
   their clinical practice.
   Methods: A multiprofessional group of providers (n = 18) completed a
   one-time semi-structured interview documenting their experiences using
   brief CBT in the primary care setting. Data were analyzed via directed
   content analysis, followed by inductive sorting of interview excerpts to
   identify key themes agreed upon by consensus. The Dynamic Adaptation
   Process model provided an overarching framework to allow better
   understanding and contextualization of emergent themes.
   Results: Providers described a variety of adaptations to the brief CBT
   to better enable its implementation. Adaptations were driven by provider
   skills and abilities (i.e., using flexible content and delivery options
   to promote treatment engagement), patient-emergent issues (i.e.,
   addressing patients' broader life and clinical concerns), and
   system-level resources (i.e., maximizing the time available to provide
   treatment).
   Conclusions: The therapeutic relationship, individual patient factors,
   and system-level factors were critical drivers guiding how providers
   adapted EBP delivery to improve the ``fit{''} into their clinical
   practice. Adaptations were generally informed by tensions between the
   EBP protocol and patient and system needs and were largely not addressed
   in the EBP protocol itself. Adaptations were generally viewed as
   acceptable by study fidelity experts and helped to more clearly define
   delivery procedures to improve future implementation efforts. It is
   recommended that future EBP implementation efforts examine the concept
   of fidelity on a continuum rather than dichotomized as adherent/not
   adherent with focused efforts to understand the context of EBP delivery.},

Title = {Implementation of a community-based intervention in the most rural and
   remote districts of Zambia: a process evaluation of safe motherhood
   action groups},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Background: A community-based intervention known as Safe Motherhood
   Action Groups (SMAGs) was implemented to increase coverage of maternal
   and neonatal health (MNH) services among the poorest and most remote
   populations in Zambia. While the outcome evaluation demonstrated
   statistically significant improvement in the MNH indicators, targets for
   key indicators were not achieved, and reasons for this shortfall were
   not known This study was aimed at understanding why the targeted key
   indicators for MNH services were not achieved
   Methods: A process evaluation, in accordance with the Medical Research
   Council (MRC) framework, was conducted in two selected rural districts
   of Zambia using qualitative approaches Focus group discussions were
   conducted with SMAGs, volunteer community health workers, and mothers
   and in-depth interviews with healthcare providers. Content analysis was
   done.
   Results: We found that SMAGs implemented much of the intervention as was
   intended, particularly in the area of women's education and referral to
   health facilities for skilled MNH services. The SMAGs went beyond their
   prescribed roles to assist women with household chores and personal
   problems and used their own resources to enhance the success of the
   intervention. Deficiencies in the intervention were reported and
   included poor ongoing support, inadequate supplies and lack of effective
   transportation such as bicycles needed for the SMAGs to facilitate then
   work. Factors external to the intervention, such as inadequacy of health
   services and skilled healthcare providers in facilities where SMAGs
   referred mothers and pool geographical access, may have led SMAGs to
   engage in the unintended role of conducting deliveries, thus
   compromising the outcome of the intervention
   Conclusion: We found evidence suggesting that although SMAGs continue to
   play prvotal roles in contribution towards accelerated coverage of MNH
   services among hard to reach populations, they are unable to meet some
   of the critical sets of MNH service targeted indicators The complexities
   of the implementation mechanisms coupled with the presence of setting
   specific socio cultural and geographical contextual factors could
   partially explain this failure. This suggests a need for innovating
   existing implementation strategies so as to help SMAGs and any other
   community health system champions to effectively respond to MNH needs of
   most at risk women and promote universal health coverage targeting
   hard-to-reach groups.},

Title = {To what extent can behaviour change techniques be identified within an
   adaptable implementation package for primary care? A prospective
   directed content analysis},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Background: Interpreting evaluations of complex interventions can be
   difficult without sufficient description of key intervention content. We
   aimed to develop an implementation package for primary care which could
   be delivered using typically available resources and could be adapted to
   target determinants of behaviour for each of four quality indicators:
   diabetes control, blood pressure control, anticoagulation for atrial
   fibrillation and risky prescribing. We describe the development and
   prospective verification of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) embedded
   within the adaptable implementation packages.
   Methods: We used an over-lapping multi-staged process. We identified
   evidence-based, candidate delivery mechanisms-mainly audit and feedback,
   educational outreach and computerised prompts and reminders. We drew
   upon interviews with primary care professionals using the Theoretical
   Domains Framework to explore likely determinants of adherence to quality
   indicators. We linked determinants to candidate BCTs. With input from
   stakeholder panels, we prioritised likely determinants and intervention
   content prior to piloting the implementation packages. Our content
   analysis assessed the extent to which embedded BCTs could be identified
   within the packages and compared them across the delivery mechanisms and
   four quality indicators.
   Results: Each implementation package included at least 27 out of 30
   potentially applicable BCTs representing 15 of 16 BCT categories. Whilst
   23 BCTs were shared across all four implementation packages (e.g. BCTs
   relating to feedback and comparing behaviour), some BCTs were unique to
   certain delivery mechanisms (e.g. `graded tasks' and `problem solving'
   for educational outreach). BCTs addressing the determinants
   `environmental context' and `social and professional roles' (e.g.
   `restructuring the social and `physical environment' and `adding objects
   to the environment') were indicator specific. We found it challenging to
   operationalise BCTs targeting `environmental context', `social
   influences' and `social and professional roles' within our chosen
   delivery mechanisms.
   Conclusion: We have demonstrated a transparent process for selecting,
   operationalising and verifying the BCT content in implementation
   packages adapted to target four quality indicators in primary care.
   There was considerable overlap in BCTs identified across the four
   indicators suggesting core BCTs can be embedded and verified within
   delivery mechanisms commonly available to primary care. Whilst feedback
   reports can include a wide range of BCTs, computerised prompts can
   deliver BCTs at the time of decision making, and educational outreach
   can allow for flexibility and individual tailoring in delivery.},

Title = {Operationalizing a model to quantify implementation of a multi-component
   intervention in a stepped-wedge trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {Background: It is challenging to interpret the results of multifaceted
   interventions due to complex program theories that are difficult to
   measure in a quantifiable manner. The aims of this paper were, first, to
   develop a model for a comprehensive quantitative implementation
   evaluation and, second, to operationalize it in the process evaluation
   of the stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial: ``Prevention
   of low back pain and its consequences among nurses' aides in elderly
   care{''} to investigate if implementation differed across intervention
   components, steps, and settings (workplaces).
   Methods: Operationalization of a quantifiable measure of implementation
   requires three steps: (1) development of a program logic and
   intervention protocol, (2) description of a complete and acceptable
   delivery of the intervention, and (3) description of what determines the
   receipt of the intervention. Program logic from a previously developed
   multifaceted stepped-wedge intervention was used. The optimal delivery
   of the intervention was defined as the deliverers' full understanding
   and following of the intervention protocol and that they performed their
   best and contributed to the participants' attention and motivation
   (fidelity). The optimal receipt of the intervention was defined as
   participants being fully present at all intervention activities
   (participation), being motivated and satisfied, and having a good social
   support (responsiveness). Measurements of the fidelity, participation,
   and responsiveness were obtained from logbooks and questionnaires.
   Fidelity was multiplied by participation to measure exposure of the
   intervention to the individual. The implementation was determined from
   optimal delivery and optimal receipt on a scale from 0 (no
   implementation) to 100 (full implementation) on individual and
   organizational level.
   Results: Out of 753 sessions, 95\% were delivered. The sessions were
   delivered with 91\% success (fidelity) across the organization. Average
   participation, fidelity, exposure, and responsiveness were 50, 93, 48,
   and 89\% across all participants. The implementation of the intervention
   was uniform across steps (p = 0.252) and workplaces (p = 0.125) but not
   for intervention components (p = 0.000). However, participation,
   fidelity, exposure, and responsiveness varied between workplaces.
   Conclusions: This study developed a quantifiable implementation
   evaluation measuring participation, fidelity, exposure, and
   responsiveness. The quantifiable implementation evaluation was suitable
   for comparing implementation across steps, components, and settings and
   can be applied in the analyses on the impact of implementation of
   complex interventions.},

Title = {An individually tailored family-centered intervention for pediatric
   obesity in primary care: study protocol of a randomized type II hybrid
   effectiveness-implementation trial (Raising Healthy Children study)},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Background: Pediatric obesity is a multi-faceted public health concern
   that can lead to cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and early mortality.
   Small changes in diet, physical activity, or BMI can significantly
   reduce the possibility of developing cardiometabolic risk factors.
   Family-based behavioral interventions are an underutilized,
   evidence-based approach that have been found to significantly prevent
   excess weight gain and obesity in children and adolescents. Poor program
   availability, low participation rates, and non-adherence are noted
   barriers to positive outcomes. Effective interventions for pediatric
   obesity in primary care are hampered by low family functioning,
   motivation, and adherence to recommendations.
   Methods: This (type II) hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized
   trial tests the Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health) program, which was
   designed to target health behavior change in children by improving
   family management practices and parenting skills, with the goal of
   preventing obesity and excess weight gain. The FCU4Health is assessment
   driven to tailor services and increase parent motivation. A sample of
   350 families with children aged 6 to 12 years who are identified as
   overweight or obese (BMI >= 85th percentile for age and gender) will be
   enrolled at three primary care clinics {[}two Federally Qualified
   Healthcare Centers (FQHCs) and a children's hospital]. All clinics serve
   predominantly Medicaid patients and a large ethnic minority population,
   including Latinos, African Americans, and American Indians who face
   disparities in obesity, cardiometabolic risk, and access to care. The
   FCU4Health will be coordinated with usual care, using two different
   delivery strategies: an embedded approach for the two FQHCs and a
   referral model for the hospital-based clinic. To assess program
   effectiveness (BMI, body composition, child health behaviors, parenting,
   and utilization of support services) and implementation outcomes (such
   outcomes as acceptability, adoption, feasibility, appropriateness,
   fidelity, and cost), we use a multi-method and multi-informant
   assessment strategy including electronic health record data, behavioral
   observation, questionnaires, interviews, and cost capture methods.
   Discussion: This study has the potential to prevent excess weight gain,
   obesity, and health disparities in children by establishing the
   effectiveness of the FCU4Health and collecting information critical for
   healthcare decision makers to support sustainable implementation of
   family-based programs in primary care.},

Title = {Exploring multi-level system factors facilitating educator training and
   implementation of evidence-based practices (EBP): a study protocol},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background: This study examines how system-wide (i.e., region, district,
   and school) mechanisms such as leadership support, training
   requirements, structure, collaboration, and education affect the use of
   evidence-based practices (EBPs) in schools and how this affects the
   outcomes for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite
   growing evidence for the positive effects of EBPs for ASD, these
   practices are not consistently or effectively used in schools. Although
   special education programs are mandated to use EBPs, there are very few
   evidence-based methods for selecting, implementing, and sustaining EBPs.
   Research focuses primarily on teacher training, without attention to
   contextual factors (e.g., implementation climate, attitudes toward EBPs,
   resource allocation, and social networks) that may impact outcomes.
   Using an implementation science framework, this project will
   prospectively examine relations between system-wide factors and
   teachers' use of EBPs and student education outcomes.
   Methods/design: Survey data will be collected from approximately 85
   regional special education directors, 170 regional program specialists,
   265 district special education directors, 265 behavior specialists, 925
   school principals, 3538 special education teachers, and 2700
   paraprofessionals. Administrative data for the students with ASD served
   by participating teachers will be examined. A total of 79 regional-,
   district-, and school-level personnel will also participate in social
   network interviews. Mixed methods, including surveys, administrative
   data, and observational checklists, will be used to gather in-depth
   information about system-wide malleable factors that relate to positive
   teacher implementation of EBPs and student outcomes. Multi-level
   modeling will be used to assess system-wide malleable factors related to
   EBP implementation which will be linked to the trainer, teacher, and
   student outcomes and examined based on moderators (e.g., district size,
   Special Education Local Plan Area structure, teachers' ASD experience).
   Finally, a dynamic social network approach will be used to map
   EBP-related connectivity across all levels of the system for selected
   regions. Dynamic network analysis will be used to gauge the degree to
   which and ways that EBP trainings, resources, and interventions are
   shared (or not shared) among school staff.
   Discussion: Results are expected to inform the development of
   system-wide interventions to improve the school-based implementation of
   EBPs for students with ASD.},

Title = {Goal feedback from whom? A physical activity intervention using an
   N-of-1 RCT},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY \& HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Pages = {701-712},
Abstract = {Objective: Adolescents are not meeting the recommended guidelines for
   physical activity. Social support and self-regulatory skills are two
   factors known to impact physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The
   study sought to examine how targeting feedback as part of a
   self-regulatory process could increase physical activity, and the
   individual who should be providing the feedback.Design: The study
   utilised an aggregated N-of-1 RCT which allows for an iterative process
   of intervention development, and examines variability within
   participants to answer the question for whom did the intervention work.
   Ten adolescents (ages 13-18) set a daily physical activity goal.
   Adolescents received a SMS text message providing feedback on goal
   attainment daily from a parent, peer, behavioural health specialist; or
   no text message (control).Main Outcome Measures: A bioharness heart rate
   monitor assessed heart rate as proxy for goal attainment. Adolescents
   also self-monitored their physical activity in the Calorie Counter and
   Diet Tracker by MyFitnessPal(TM) app (commercially available).Results:
   Intervention demonstrated a significant effect for 30\% of the sample in
   increasing MVPA (M-increase=52 min), with no significant effect on
   sedentary behaviour.Conclusion: A single occasion of text messaging from
   the right person can produce changes, however, careful consideration
   should be given to who provides the feedback.},

Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-57},
Abstract = {We argue that the active ingredients of behaviour change interventions,
   often called behaviour change methods (BCMs) or techniques (BCTs), can
   usefully be placed on a dimension of psychological aggregation. We
   introduce evolutionary learning processes (ELPs) as fundamental building
   blocks that are on a lower level of psychological aggregation than
   BCMs/BCTs. A better understanding of ELPs is useful to select the
   appropriate BCMs/BCTs to target determinants of behaviour, or vice
   versa, to identify potential determinants targeted by a given BCM/BCT,
   and to optimally translate them into practical applications. Using these
   insights during intervention development may increase the likelihood of
   developing effective interventions - both in terms of behaviour change
   as well as maintenance of behaviour change.},

Abstract = {Computer-tailored interventions, which deliver health messages adjusted
   based on characteristics of the message recipient, can effectively
   improve a range of health behaviours. Typically, the content of the
   message is tailored to user demographics, health behaviours and social
   cognitive factors (e.g., intentions, attitudes, self-efficacy, perceived
   social support) to increase message relevance, and thus the extent to
   which the message is read, considered and translated into attitude and
   behaviour change. Some researchers have suggested that the efficacy of
   computer-tailored interventions may be further enhanced by adapting
   messages to suit recipients' need for cognition (NFC) - a personality
   trait describing how individuals tend to process information. However,
   the likely impact of doing so, especially when tailored in conjunction
   with other variables, requires further consideration. It is possible
   that intervention effects may be reduced in some circumstances due to
   interactions with other variables (e.g., perceived relevance) that also
   influence information processing. From a practical point of view, it is
   also necessary to consider how to optimally operationalise and measure
   NFC if it is to be a useful tailoring variable. This paper aims to
   facilitate further research in this area by critically examining these
   issues based on relevant theories and existing evidence.},

Abstract = {Implementing research findings into healthcare practice and policy is a
   complex process occurring in diverse contexts; it invariably depends on
   changing human behaviour in many parts of an intricate implementation
   system. Questions asked with the aim of improving implementation are
   multifarious variants of `What works, compared with what, how well, with
   what exposure, with what behaviours (for how long), for whom, in what
   setting and why?'. Relevant evidence is being published at a high rate,
   but its quantity, complexity and lack of shared terminologies present
   challenges. The achievement of efficient, effective and timely synthesis
   of evidence is facilitated by using `ontologies' to systematically
   structure and organise the evidence about constructs and their
   relationships, using a controlled, well-defined vocabulary.},

Title = {Implementation and dissemination of a transition of care program for
   rural veterans: a controlled before and after study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {Background: Adapting promising health care interventions to local
   settings is a critical component in the dissemination and implementation
   process. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) rural transitions
   nurse program (TNP) is a nurse-led, Veteran-centered intervention
   designed to improve transitional care for rural Veterans funded by VA
   national offices for dissemination to other VA sites serving a
   predominantly rural Veteran population. Here, we describe our novel
   approach to the implementation and evaluation = the TNP.
   Methods: This is a controlled before and after study that assesses both
   implementation and intervention outcomes. During pre-implementation, we
   assessed site context using a mixed method approach with data from
   diverse sources including facility-level quantitative data, key
   informant and Veteran interviews, observations of the discharge process,
   and a group brainstorming activity. We used the Practical Robust
   Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) to inform our inquiries,
   to integrate data from all sources, and to identify factors that may
   affect implementation. In the implementation phase, we will use internal
   and external facilitation, paired with audit and feedback, to encourage
   appropriate contextual adaptations. We will use a modified Stirman
   framework to document adaptations. During the evaluation phase, we will
   measure intervention and implementation outcomes at each site using the
   RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and
   Maintenance). We will conduct a difference-in-differences analysis with
   propensity-matched Veterans and VA facilities as a control. Our primary
   intervention outcome is 30-day readmission and Emergency Department
   visit rates. We will use our findings to develop an implementation
   toolkit that will inform the larger scale-up of the TNP across the VA.
   Discussion: The use of PRISM to inform pre-implementation evaluation and
   synthesize data from multiple sources, coupled with internal and
   external facilitation, is a novel approach to engaging sites in adapting
   interventions while promoting fidelity to the intervention. Our
   application of PRISM to pre-implementation and midline evaluation, as
   well as documentation of adaptations, provides an opportunity to
   identify and address contextual factors that may impede or enhance
   implementation and sustainability of health interventions and inform
   dissemination.},

Title = {The Human Behaviour-Change Project: harnessing the power of artificial

Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Background: Behaviour change is key to addressing both the challenges
   facing human health and wellbeing and to promoting the uptake of
   research findings in health policy and practice. We need to make better
   use of the vast amount of accumulating evidence from behaviour change
   intervention (BCI) evaluations and promote the uptake of that evidence
   into a wide range of contexts. The scale and complexity of the task of
   synthesising and interpreting this evidence, and increasing evidence
   timeliness and accessibility, will require increased computer support.
   The Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP) will use Artificial
   Intelligence and Machine Learning to (i) develop and evaluate a
   `Knowledge System' that automatically extracts, synthesises and
   interprets findings from BCI evaluation reports to generate new insights
   about behaviour change and improve prediction of intervention
   effectiveness and (ii) allow users, such as practitioners, policy makers
   and researchers, to easily and efficiently query the system to get
   answers to variants of the question `What works, compared with what, how
   well, with what exposure, with what behaviours (for how long), for whom,
   in what settings and why?'.
   Methods: The HBCP will: a) develop an ontology of BCI evaluations and
   their reports linking effect sizes for given target behaviours with
   intervention content and delivery and mechanisms of action, as moderated
   by exposure, populations and settings; b) develop and train an automated
   feature extraction system to annotate BCI evaluation reports using this
   ontology; c) develop and train machine learning and reasoning algorithms
   to use the annotated BCI evaluation reports to predict effect sizes for
   particular combinations of behaviours, interventions, populations and
   settings; d) build user and machine interfaces for interrogating and
   updating the knowledge base; and e) evaluate all the above in terms of
   performance and utility.
   Discussion: The HBCP aims to revolutionise our ability to synthesise,
   interpret and deliver evidence on behaviour change interventions that is
   up-to-date and tailored to user need and context. This will enhance the
   usefulness, and support the implementation of, that evidence.},

Title = {Designing an implementation intervention with the Behaviour Change Wheel
   for health provider smoking cessation care for Australian Indigenous
   pregnant women},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Background: Indigenous smoking rates are up to 80\% among pregnant
   women: prevalence among pregnant Australian Indigenous women was 45\% in
   2014, contributing significantly to the health gap for Indigenous
   Australians. We aimed to develop an implementation intervention to
   improve smoking cessation care (SCC) for pregnant Indigenous smokers, an
   outcome to be achieved by training health providers at Aboriginal
   Medical Services (AMS) in a culturally competent approach, developed
   collaboratively with AMS.
   Method: The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW), incorporating the COM-B model
   (capability, opportunity and motivation for behavioural interventions),
   provided a framework for the development of the Indigenous Counselling
   and Nicotine (ICAN) QUIT in Pregnancy implementation intervention at
   provider and patient levels. We identified evidence-practice gaps
   through (i) systematic literature reviews, (ii) a national survey of
   clinicians and (iii) a qualitative study of smoking and quitting with
   Aboriginal mothers. We followed the three stages recommended in Michie
   et al.'s ``Behaviour Change Wheel{''} guide.
   Results: Targets identified for health provider behaviour change
   included the following: capability (psychological capability, knowledge
   and skills) by training clinicians in pharmacotherapy to assist women to
   quit; motivation (optimism) by presenting evidence of effectiveness, and
   positive testimonials from patients and clinicians; and opportunity
   (environmental context and resources) by promoting a whole-of-service
   approach and structuring consultations using a flipchart and prompts.
   Education and training were selected as the main intervention functions.
   For health providers, the delivery mode was webinar, to accommodate time
   and location constraints, bringing the training to the services; for
   patients, face-to-face consultations were supported by a booklet
   embedded with videos to improve patients' capability, opportunity and
   motivation.
   Conclusions: The ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy was an intervention to train
   health providers at Aboriginal Medical Services in how to implement
   culturally competent evidence-based practice including counselling and
   nicotine replacement therapy for pregnant patients who smoke. The BCW
   aided in scientifically and systematically informing this targeted
   implementation intervention based on the identified gaps in SCC by
   health providers. Multiple factors impact at systemic, provider,
   community and individual levels. This process was therefore important
   for defining the design and intervention components, prior to a
   conducting a pilot feasibility trial, then leading on to a full clinical
   trial.},

Abstract = {Objective: Childhood sun exposure increases risk of skin cancer in later
   life. Parents of young children play an important role in minimizing
   childhood sun exposure. The aim of the current study was to identify the
   motivational, volitional, and implicit antecedents of parents'
   sun-protective behaviors based on an Integrated Behavior Change model.
   Method: Parents (N = 373) of 2- to 5-year-old children self-reported
   their intentions, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral
   control, autonomous and controlled motivation, action plans, habit, and
   past behaviors with respect to sun-protective behaviors for their
   children. Two weeks later (n = 273), the parents self-reported their
   participation in sun-protective behaviors for their child. Results: Data
   were analyzed using variance-based structural equation modeling. Results
   showed significant direct effects of attitudes, subjective norm,
   perceived behavioral control, and past behavior on intentions, and
   significant direct effects of autonomous motivation, perceived
   behavioral control, intentions, action planning, habit, and past
   behavior on parents' participation in sun-protective behaviors for their
   child. There were also significant total indirect effects of autonomous
   motivation on intentions mediated by attitudes and subjective norm.
   Conclusions: Current results indicate that parents' sun-protective
   behaviors toward their children are a function of motivational
   (autonomous motivation, intentions), volitional (action planning), and
   implicit (habit) factors. The findings from the current study provide
   formative data to inform the development of behavior change
   interventions to increase parents' participation in sun-protective
   behaviors for their children.},

Title = {Efficacy of a Multilevel Intervention on the Mental Health of People

Abstract = {Objective: HIV has a profound impact on infected individuals and their
   families. This study evaluated the efficacy of an intervention aimed at
   improving the mental health of people living with HIV (PLH) and their
   family members. Method: A randomized controlled trial of 475 PLH and 522
   family members was conducted in Anhui, China. The intervention comprised
   activities at individual, family, and community levels. The study
   outcomes, which included depressive symptoms and coping with illness for
   the PLH and depressive symptoms and caregiver burden for the family
   members, were assessed at baseline and at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month
   follow-up. We used a mixed-effects regression model with village-and
   participant-level random effects to assess the intervention effect on
   the improvement of outcome measures. Results: Relative to the control
   condition, the PLH and family members of the intervention group reported
   a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. The largest difference
   in depressive symptoms was observed at 6 months for the PLH and at 12
   months for family members. Decreases in perceived caregiver burden over
   time were observed for family members in both conditions; however, the
   group difference did not reach statistical significance. Significant
   intervention effect on the coping with illness was reported by the PLH.
   Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of empowering families
   affected by HIV to confront the challenges together rather than
   individually. It may be optimal for future programs to include both PLH
   and their family members to maximize intervention effects through
   strengthening interactions and support within a family.},

Title = {Quality improvement, implementation, and dissemination strategies to

   review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Background: Some outcomes for children with mental health problems
   remain suboptimal because of poor access to care and the failure of
   systems and providers to adopt established quality improvement
   strategies and interventions with proven effectiveness. This review had
   three goals: (1) assess the effectiveness of quality improvement,
   implementation, and dissemination strategies intended to improve the
   mental health care of children and adolescents; (2) examine harms
   associated with these strategies; and (3) determine whether
   effectiveness or harms differ for subgroups based on system,
   organizational, practitioner, or patient characteristics.
   Methods: Sources included MEDLINE (R), the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO,
   and CINAHL, from database inception through February 17, 2017.
   Additional sources included gray literature, additional studies from
   reference lists, and technical experts. Two reviewers selected relevant
   randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, extracted
   data, and assessed risk of bias. Dual analysis, synthesis, and grading
   of the strength of evidence for each outcome followed for studies
   meeting inclusion criteria. We also used qualitative comparative
   analysis to examine relationships between combinations of strategy
   components and improvements in outcomes.
   Results: We identified 18 strategies described in 19 studies. Eleven
   strategies significantly improved at least one measure of intermediate
   outcomes, final health outcomes, or resource use. Moderate strength of
   evidence ( from one RCT) supported using provider financial incentives
   such as pay for performance to improve the competence with which
   practitioners can implement evidence-based practices (EBPs). We found
   inconsistent evidence involving strategies with educational meetings,
   materials, and outreach; programs appeared to be successful in
   combination with reminders or providing practitioners with newly
   collected clinical information. We also found low strength of evidence
   for no benefit for initiatives that included only educational materials
   or meetings (or both), or only educational materials and outreach
   components. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions on harms and
   moderators of interventions.
   Conclusions: Several strategies can improve both intermediate and final
   health outcomes and resource use. This complex and heterogeneous body of
   evidence does not permit us to have a high degree of confidence about
   the efficacy of any one strategy because we generally found only a
   single study testing each strategy.},

Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: Implementing new practices requires changes in the behaviour
   of relevant actors, and this is facilitated by understanding of the
   determinants of current and desired behaviours. The Theoretical Domains
   Framework (TDF) was developed by a collaboration of behavioural
   scientists and implementation researchers who identified theories
   relevant to implementation and grouped constructs from these theories
   into domains. The collaboration aimed to provide a comprehensive,
   theory-informed approach to identify determinants of behaviour. The
   first version was published in 2005, and a subsequent version following
   a validation exercise was published in 2012. This guide offers practical
   guidance for those who wish to apply the TDF to assess implementation
   problems and support intervention design. It presents a brief rationale
   for using a theoretical approach to investigate and address
   implementation problems, summarises the TDF and its development, and
   describes how to apply the TDF to achieve implementation objectives.
   Examples from the implementation research literature are presented to
   illustrate relevant methods and practical considerations.
   Methods: Researchers from Canada, the UK and Australia attended a 3-day
   meeting in December 2012 to build an international collaboration among
   researchers and decision-makers interested in the advancing use of the
   TDF. The participants were experienced in using the TDF to assess
   implementation problems, design interventions, and/or understand change
   processes. This guide is an output of the meeting and also draws on the
   authors' collective experience. Examples from the implementation
   research literature judged by authors to be representative of specific
   applications of the TDF are included in this guide.
   Results: We explain and illustrate methods, with a focus on qualitative
   approaches, for selecting and specifying target behaviours key to
   implementation, selecting the study design, deciding the sampling
   strategy, developing study materials, collecting and analysing data, and
   reporting findings of TDF-based studies. Areas for development include
   methods for triangulating data, e.g. from interviews, questionnaires and
   observation and methods for designing interventions based on TDF-based
   problem analysis.
   Conclusions: We offer this guide to the implementation community to
   assist in the application of the TDF to achieve implementation
   objectives. Benefits of using the TDF include the provision of a
   theoretical basis for implementation studies, good coverage of potential
   reasons for slow diffusion of evidence into practice and a method for
   progressing from theory-based investigation to intervention.},

Title = {Organizational theory for dissemination and implementation research},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Background: Even under optimal internal organizational conditions,
   implementation can be undermined by changes in organizations' external
   environments, such as fluctuations in funding, adjustments in
   contracting practices, new technology, new legislation, changes in
   clinical practice guidelines and recommendations, or other environmental
   shifts. Internal organizational conditions are increasingly reflected in
   implementation frameworks, but nuanced explanations of how
   organizations' external environments influence implementation success
   are lacking in implementation research. Organizational theories offer
   implementation researchers a host of existing, highly relevant, and
   heretofore largely untapped explanations of the complex interaction
   between organizations and their environment. In this paper, we
   demonstrate the utility of organizational theories for implementation
   research.
   Discussion: We applied four well-known organizational theories
   (institutional theory, transaction cost economics, contingency theories,
   and resource dependency theory) to published descriptions of efforts to
   implement SafeCare, an evidence-based practice for preventing child
   abuse and neglect. Transaction cost economics theory explained how
   frequent, uncertain processes for contracting for SafeCare may have
   generated inefficiencies and thus compromised implementation among
   private child welfare organizations. Institutional theory explained how
   child welfare systems may have been motivated to implement SafeCare
   because doing so aligned with expectations of key stakeholders within
   child welfare systems' professional communities. Contingency theories
   explained how efforts such as interagency collaborative teams promoted
   SafeCare implementation by facilitating adaptation to child welfare
   agencies' internal and external contexts. Resource dependency theory
   (RDT) explained how interagency relationships, supported by contracts,
   memoranda of understanding, and negotiations, facilitated SafeCare
   implementation by balancing autonomy and dependence on funding agencies
   and SafeCare developers.
   Summary: In addition to the retrospective application of organizational
   theories demonstrated above, we advocate for the proactive use of
   organizational theories to design implementation research. For example,
   implementation strategies should be selected to minimize transaction
   costs, promote and maintain congruence between organizations' dynamic
   internal and external contexts over time, and simultaneously attend to
   organizations' financial needs while preserving their autonomy. We
   describe implications of applying organizational theory in
   implementation research for implementation strategies, the evaluation of
   implementation efforts, measurement, research design, theory, and
   practice. We also offer guidance to implementation researchers for
   applying organizational theory.},

Title = {Using media to impact health policy-making: an integrative systematic
   review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Introduction: Media interventions can potentially play a major role in
   influencing health policies. This integrative systematic review aimed to
   assess the effects of planned media interventions-including social
   media-on the health policy-making process.
   Methods: Eligible study designs included randomized and non-randomized
   designs, economic studies, process evaluation studies, stakeholder
   analyses, qualitative methods, and case studies. We electronically
   searched Medline, EMBASE, Communication and Mass Media Complete,
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the WHO Global
   Health Library. We followed standard systematic review methodology for
   study selection, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment.
   Results: Twenty-one studies met our eligibility criteria: 10 evaluation
   studies using either quantitative (n = 7) or qualitative (n = 3) designs
   and 11 case studies. None of the evaluation studies were on social
   media. The findings of the evaluation studies suggest that media
   interventions may have a positive impact when used as accountability
   tools leading to prioritizing and initiating policy discussions, as
   tools to increase policymakers' awareness, as tools to influence policy
   formulation, as awareness tools leading to policy adoption, and as
   awareness tools to improve compliance with laws and regulations. In one
   study, media-generated attention had a negative effect on policy
   advocacy as it mobilized opponents who defeated the passage of the bills
   that the media intervention advocated for. We judged the confidence in
   the available evidence as limited due to the risk of bias in the
   included studies and the indirectness of the evidence.
   Conclusion: There is currently a lack of reliable evidence to guide
   decisions on the use of media interventions to influence health
   policy-making. Additional and better-designed, conducted, and reported
   primary research is needed to better understand the effects of media
   interventions, particularly social media, on health policy-making
   processes, and the circumstances under which media interventions are
   successful.},

Title = {A Hybrid III stepped wedge cluster randomized trial testing an

   practice in VA Homeless Primary Care Treatment Programs},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: Homeless veterans often have multiple health care and
   psychosocial needs, including assistance with access to housing and
   health care, as well as support for ongoing treatment engagement. The
   Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) developed specialized Homeless
   Patient Alignment Care Teams (HPACT) with the goal of offering an
   integrated, `` one-stop program{''} to address housing and health care
   needs of homeless veterans. However, while 70\% of HPACT's veteran
   enrollees have co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders,
   HPACT does not have a uniform, embedded treatment protocol for this
   subpopulation. One wraparound intervention designed to address the needs
   of homeless veterans with co-occurring mental health and substance use
   disorders which is suitable to be integrated into HPACT clinic sites is
   the evidence-based practice called Maintaining Independence and Sobriety
   through Systems Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Veterans Edition,
   or MISSION-Vet. Despite the promise of MISSION-Vet within HPACT clinics,
   implementation of an evidence-based intervention within a busy program
   like HPACT can be difficult. The current study is being undertaken to
   identify an appropriate implementation strategy for MISSION-Vet within
   HPACT. The study will test the implementation platform called
   Facilitation and compared to implementation as usual (IU). The aims of
   this study are as follows: (1) Compare the extent to which IU or
   Facilitation strategies achieve fidelity to the MISSION-Vet intervention
   as delivered by HPACT homeless provider staff. (2) Compare the effects
   of Facilitation and IU strategies on the National HPACT Performance
   Measures. (3) Compare the effects of IU and Facilitation on the
   permanent housing status. (4) Identify and describe key stakeholders'
   (patients, providers, staff) experiences with, and perspectives on, the
   barriers to, and facilitators of implementing MISSION.
   Design: Type III Hybrid modified stepped wedge implementation comparing
   IU to Facilitation across seven HPACT teams in three sites in the
   greater Los Angeles VA system. This is a cluster randomized trial.
   Discussion: Integrating MISSION-Vet within HPACT has the potential to
   improve the health of thousands of veterans, but it is crucial to
   implement the intervention appropriately in order for it to succeed. The
   lessons learned in this protocol could assist with a larger roll-out of
   MISSION within HPACT. This protocol is registered with clinicaltrials.

Title = {Using Getting To Outcomes to facilitate the use of an evidence-based

Abstract = {Background: Incorporating evidence-based integrated treatment for dual
   disorders into typical care settings has been challenging, especially
   among those serving Veterans who are homeless. This paper presents an
   evaluation of an effort to incorporate an evidence-based, dual disorder
   treatment called Maintaining Independence and Sobriety Through Systems
   Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Veterans Edition (MISSION-Vet)
   into case management teams serving Veterans who are homeless, using an
   implementation strategy called Getting To Outcomes (GTO).
   Methods: This Hybrid Type III, cluster-randomized controlled trial
   assessed the impact of GTO over and above MISSION-Vet Implementation as
   Usual (IU). Both conditions received standard MISSION-Vet training and
   manuals. The GTO group received an implementation manual, training,
   technical assistance, and data feedback. The study occurred in teams at
   three large VA Medical Centers over 2 years. Within each team, existing
   sub-teams (case managers and Veterans they serve) were the clusters
   randomly assigned. The trial assessed MISSION-Vet services delivered and
   collected via administrative data and implementation barriers and
   facilitators, via semi-structured interview.
   Results: No case managers in the IU group initiated MISSION-Vet while
   68\% in the GTO group did. Seven percent of Veterans with case managers
   in the GTO group received at least one MISSION-Vet session. Most case
   managers appreciated the MISSION-Vet materials and felt the GTO planning
   meetings supported using MISSION-Vet. Case manager interviews also
   showed that MISSION-Vet could be confusing; there was little involvement
   from leadership after their initial agreement to participate; the data
   feedback system had a number of difficulties; and case managers did not
   have the resources to implement all aspects of MISSION-Vet.
   Conclusions: This project shows that GTO-like support can help launch
   new practices but that multiple implementation facilitators are needed
   for successful execution of a complex evidence-based program like
   MISSION-Vet.},

Title = {Methods for designing interventions to change healthcare professionals'
   behaviour: a systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Background: Systematic reviews consistently indicate that interventions
   to change healthcare professional (HCP) behaviour are haphazardly
   designed and poorly specified. Clarity about methods for designing and
   specifying interventions is needed. The objective of this review was to
   identify published methods for designing interventions to change HCP
   behaviour.
   Methods: A search of MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO was conducted from
   1996 to April 2015. Using inclusion/exclusion criteria, a broad screen
   of abstracts by one rater was followed by a strict screen of full text
   for all potentially relevant papers by three raters. An inductive
   approach was first applied to the included studies to identify
   commonalities and differences between the descriptions of methods across
   the papers. Based on this process and knowledge of related literatures,
   we developed a data extraction framework that included, e.g. level of
   change (e.g. individual versus organization); context of development; a
   brief description of the method; tasks included in the method (e.g.
   barrier identification, component selection, use of theory).
   Results: 3966 titles and abstracts and 64 full-text papers were screened
   to yield 15 papers included in the review, each outlining one design
   method. All of the papers reported methods developed within a specific
   context. Thirteen papers included barrier identification and 13 included
   linking barriers to intervention components; although not the same 13
   papers. Thirteen papers targeted individual HCPs with only one paper
   targeting change across individual, organization, and system levels. The
   use of theory and user engagement were included in 13/15 and 13/15
   papers, respectively.
   Conclusions: There is an agreement across methods of four tasks that
   need to be completed when designing individual-level interventions:
   identifying barriers, selecting intervention components, using theory,
   and engaging end-users. Methods also consist of further additional
   tasks. Examples of methods for designing the organisation and
   system-level interventions were limited. Further analysis of design
   tasks could facilitate the development of detailed guidelines for
   designing interventions.},

Title = {Multi-year school-based implementation and student outcomes of an
   evidencebased risk reduction intervention},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Background: Intervention effects observed in efficacy trials are rarely
   replicated when the interventions are broadly disseminated, underscoring
   the need for more information about factors influencing real-life
   implementation and program impact. Using data from the ongoing national
   implementation of an evidence-based HIV prevention program {[}Focus on
   Youth in The Caribbean (FOYC)] in The Bahamas, this study examines
   factors influencing teachers' patterns of implementation, the impact of
   teachers' initial implementation of FOYC, and subsequent delivery of the
   booster sessions on students' outcomes.
   Methods: Data were collected from the 80 government elementary and 34
   middle schools between 2011 and 2014, involving 208 grade 6, 75 grade 7,
   and 58 grade 8 teachers and 4411 students initially in grade 6 and
   followed for 3 years. Student outcomes include HIV/AIDS knowledge,
   reproductive health skills, self-efficacy, and intention to use
   protection. Data from teachers includes implementation and modification
   of the curriculum, attitudes towards the prevention program, comfort
   level with the curriculum, and attendance at training workshops.
   Structural equation modeling and mixed-effect modeling analyses were
   applied to examine the impact of teachers' implementation.
   Results: Teachers' attitudes towards and comfort with the intervention
   curriculum, and attendance at the curriculum training workshop had a
   direct effect on teachers' patterns of implementation, which had a
   direct effect on student outcomes. Teachers' attitudes had a direct
   positive effect on student outcomes. Teachers' training in interactive
   teaching methods and longer duration as teachers were positively
   associated with teachers' comfort with the curriculum. High-quality
   implementation in grade 6 was significantly related to student outcomes
   in grades 6 and 7 post-implementation. Level of implementation of the
   booster sessions in grades 7 and 8 were likewise significantly related
   to subsequent student outcomes in both grades.
   Conclusions: High-quality initial implementation of a prevention program
   is significantly related to better program outcomes. Poor subsequent
   delivery of booster sessions can undermine the positive effects from the
   initial implementation while strong subsequent delivery of booster
   sessions can partially overcome poor initial implementation.},

Title = {Combined use of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
   (CFIR) and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF): a systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Background: Over 60 implementation frameworks exist. Using multiple
   frameworks may help researchers to address multiple study purposes,
   levels, and degrees of theoretical heritage and operationalizability;
   however, using multiple frameworks may result in unnecessary complexity
   and redundancy if doing so does not address study needs. The
   Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the
   Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) are both well-operationalized,
   multi-level implementation determinant frameworks derived from theory.
   As such, the rationale for using the frameworks in combination (i.e.,
   CFIR + TDF) is unclear. The objective of this systematic review was to
   elucidate the rationale for using CFIR + TDF by (1) describing studies
   that have used CFIR + TDF, (2) how they used CFIR + TDF, and (2) their
   stated rationale for using CFIR + TDF.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic review to identify studies that
   mentioned both the CFIR and the TDF, were written in English, were
   peer-reviewed, and reported either a protocol or results of an empirical
   study in MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, or Google Scholar. We
   then abstracted data into a matrix and analyzed it qualitatively,
   identifying salient themes.
   Findings: We identified five protocols and seven completed studies that
   used CFIR + TDF. CFIR + TDF was applied to studies in several countries,
   to a range of healthcare interventions, and at multiple intervention
   phases; used many designs, methods, and units of analysis; and assessed
   a variety of outcomes. Three studies indicated that using CFIR + TDF
   addressed multiple study purposes. Six studies indicated that using CFIR
   + TDF addressed multiple conceptual levels. Four studies did not
   explicitly state their rationale for using CFIR + TDF.
   Conclusions: Differences in the purposes that authors of the CFIR (e.g.,
   comprehensive set of implementation determinants) and the TDF (e.g.,
   intervention development) propose help to justify the use of CFIR + TDF.
   Given that the CFIR and the TDF are both multi-level frameworks, the
   rationale that using CFIR + TDF is needed to address multiple conceptual
   levels may reflect potentially misleading conventional wisdom. On the
   other hand, using CFIR + TDF may more fully define the multi-level
   nature of implementation. To avoid concerns about unnecessary complexity
   and redundancy, scholars who use CFIR + TDF and combinations of other
   frameworks should specify how the frameworks contribute to their study.},

Abstract = {This article, in an effort to assist the selection and deployment of
   evidence-informed strategies, proposes a new conceptual framework for
   responding to community violenceamong youth. First, the phenomenon of
   community violence is understood in context using a new violence
   typology organized along a continuum. Second, the need for a new
   anti-community violence framework is established. Third, a framework is
   developed, blending concepts from the fields of public safety and public
   health. Fourth, evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses
   concerning community violence is summarized and categorized. Finally, an
   anti-violence framework populated with evidence-informed strategies is
   presented and discussed.},

Abstract = {Behaviour change interventions can be effective in helping people to
   lose weight, but weight is often regained. Effective interventions are
   required to prevent this. We conducted a systematic review and synthesis
   of qualitative research on people's experiences of weight loss
   maintenance. We searched bibliographic databases for qualitative studies
   about the experience of currently or previously overweight adults trying
   to maintain weight loss. We thematically synthesised study findings to
   develop a model of weight loss maintenance. Twenty six studies from five
   countries with 710 participants were included. The model developed
   through our synthesis proposes that making the behaviour changes
   required for weight loss maintenance generates psychological `tension'
   due to the need to override existing habits, and incompatibility of the
   new behaviours with the fulfilment of psychological needs. Successful
   maintenance involves management or resolution of this tension.
   Management of tension can be achieved through self-regulation, renewing
   of motivation and managing external influences, although this can
   require constant effort. Resolution may be achieved through changing
   habits, finding non-obesogenic methods for addressing needs, and
   potentially through change in self-concept. Implications for the
   development of weight loss maintenance interventions are explored.},

Title = {Zooming into daily life: within-person associations between physical
   activity and affect in young adults},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY \& HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {588-604},
Abstract = {Objective: Negative affect in daily life is linked to poorer mental and
   physical health. Activity could serve as an effective, low-cost
   intervention to improve affect. However, few prior studies have assessed
   physical activity and affect in everyday life, limiting the ecological
   validity of prior findings. This study investigates whether daily
   activity is associated with negative and positive evening affect in
   young adults.
   Design: Young adults (N = 189, Mdn = 23.00) participated in an intensive
   longitudinal study over 10 consecutive days.
   Main Outcome Measures: Participants wore accelerometers to objectively
   assess moderate-to-vigorous physical activity continuously throughout
   the day and reported their affect in time-stamped online evening diaries
   before going to sleep.
   Results: On days when participants engaged in more activity than usual,
   they reported not only less depressed and angry evening affect but also
   more vigour and serenity in the evening.
   Conclusion: Young adults showed both less negative and more positive
   affect on days with more activity. Physical activity is a promising
   health promotion strategy for physical and mental well-being.},

Abstract = {Most of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy targeted restoration
   and few have targeted primary prevention. The purpose of this study is
   to obtain the knowledge for further development on preventive mental
   healthcare application. We developed a personal mental healthcare
   application which aimed to give users the chance to manage their mental
   health by self-monitoring and regulating their behavior. Through the
   30-day field trial, the results showed improvement of mood score through
   conducting of suggested action, and the depressive mood of the
   participants was significantly decreased after the trial. The
   possibility of application and further problem was confirmed.},

Title = {What do we know about preventing school violence? A systematic review of
   systematic reviews},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {187-223},
Abstract = {Many children across the world are exposed to school violence, which
   undermines their right to education and adversely affects their
   development. Studies of interventions for school violence suggest that
   it can be prevented. However, this evidence base is challenging to
   navigate. We completed a systematic review of interventions to reduce
   four types of school violence: (a) peer violence; (b) corporal
   punishment; (c) student-on-teacher violence and (d) teacher-on-student
   violence. Reviewers independently searched databases and journals.
   Included studies were published between 2005 and 2015; in English;
   considered school-based interventions for children and measured violence
   as an outcome. Many systematic reviews were found, thus we completed a
   systematic review of systematic reviews. Only systematic reviews on
   interventions for intimate partner violence (IPV) and peer aggression
   were found. These reviews were generally of moderate quality. Research
   on both types of violence was largely completed in North America. Only a
   handful of programmes demonstrate promise in preventing IPV. Cognitive
   behavioral, social-emotional and peer mentoring/mediation programmes
   showed promise in reducing the levels of perpetration of peer
   aggression. Further research needs to determine the long-term effects of
   interventions, potential moderators and mediators of program effects,
   program effects across different contexts and key intervention
   components.},

Abstract = {n-of-1 studies test hypotheses within individuals based on repeated
   measurement of variables within the individual over time.
   Intraindividual effects may differ from those found in
   between-participant studies. Using examples from a systematic review of
   n-of-1 studies in health behaviour research, this article provides a
   state of the art overview of the use of n-of-1 methods, organised
   according to key methodological considerations related to n-of-1 design
   and analysis, and describes future challenges and opportunities. A
   comprehensive search strategy (PROSPERO: CRD42014007258) was used to
   identify articles published between 2000 and 2016, reporting
   observational or interventional n-of-1 studies with health behaviour
   outcomes. Thirtynine articles were identified which reported on n-of-1
   observational designs and a range of n-of-1 interventional designs,
   including AB, ABA, ABABA, alternating treatments, n-of-1 randomised
   controlled trial, multiple baseline and changing criterion designs.
   Behaviours measured included treatment adherence, physical activity,
   drug/alcohol use, sleep, smoking and eating behaviour. Descriptive,
   visual or statistical analyses were used. We identify scope and
   opportunities for using n-of-1 methods to answer key questions in health
   behaviour research. n-of-1 methods provide the tools needed to help
   advance theoretical knowledge and personalise/tailor health behaviour
   interventions to individuals.},

Title = {Development and pilot testing of a novel behavioral intervention for
   adults with type 2 diabetes using intervention mapping},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {317-336},
Abstract = {Purpose: A healthy diet and consistent physical activity (PA) form the
   foundation for effective self-management in adults with type 2 diabetes
   mellitus (T2DM). Behavioral interventions, which target diet and PA, can
   facilitate effective diabetes self-management practices. Greater clarity
   regarding the ` active ingredients' incorporated into behavioral
   interventions is needed to inform the evidence base about effective
   intervention techniques to advance behavioral theories and to improve
   clinical practice. The use of intervention mapping (IM) to develop a
   novel diabetes intervention to increase consumption of low glycemic
   index (GI) foods and to increase moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA is
   presented.
   Methods: Determinants from self-regulation and the Health Action Process
   Approach theoretical framework formed the foundation of the
   intervention. The IM taxonomy of behavior change methods and strategies
   from Hope Therapy (e. g. goal maps) were used to guide techniques for
   changing selected theoretical determinants of behavior. A pilot study of
   the intervention among adults with T2DM (n = 12) was conducted using a
   pre-/post-test design to evaluate intervention components and
   participant acceptability.
   Results: Participants attended a mean (+/- SD) of 8 (+/- 1.4) of the 10
   weekly 90-minute, group-based sessions. The magnitude of effect was
   moderate (d > 0.50) for the change in behavioral intentions, action
   control, and action and coping planning for engaging in PA and large (d
   > 0.80) for the change in action self-efficacy and action and coping
   planning for eating low GI foods postintervention.
   Conclusions: Greater emphasis on value-based decision-making, the goal
   mapping process, and successively progressive exercise goals should be
   included in future versions of the intervention. Based on pilot testing,
   a larger randomized controlled trial that incorporates these
   intervention modifications is warranted and the modified intervention
   has a greater likelihood for success.},

Abstract = {After weight loss, most individuals regain lost weight. Interventions to
   support the transition fromsuccessful loss to weight loss maintenance
   (WLM), regardless of the method of prior weight loss, are needed. The
   aims of this study were to (1) develop a face-to-face behavioural
   intervention session to support overweight and obese individuals who
   have recently lost a clinically significant amount of weight in the
   transition to WLM; (2) to assess the single-session intervention for
   acceptability and feasibility prior to its use in a larger, 12-month,
   multi-component trial; and (3) to optimise the intervention session for
   future use based on participant feedback. Participants with a Body Mass
   Index of >= 25 kg/m(2) prior to a >= 5\% weight loss in the previous 12
   months were recruited via the local government authority and
   community-based advertisements. Each attended the one-hour session with
   a trained facilitator, which focused on setting maintenance-relevant
   weight, eating, and physical activity goals. Semi-structured interviews
   were carried out immediately post-session to obtain feedback on the
   acceptability of this intervention component. Data were used to generate
   recommendations for changes to the session, which were discussed by the
   team, and used to optimise the session. Seventeen participants (13
   female; median WL = 13\%) were recruited. All participants evaluated the
   intervention session positively; 11 participants suggested improvements
   including reducing information provision in favour of greater focus on
   identifying and coping with barriers, and the inclusion of practical
   examples. The systematic refinement and optimisation process resulted in
   an acceptable and feasible face-to-face behavioural intervention session
   (described here), which will be tested as part of a multi-component
   intervention. We anticipate the session could be used to supplement
   existing support including online services, and has the potential to
   benefit people who have lost a clinically significant amount of weight
   to achieve WLM over the long term.},

Title = {Effective self-regulation change techniques to promote mental wellbeing
   among adolescents: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW},

Abstract = {Mental wellbeing is influenced by self-regulation processes. However,
   little is known on the efficacy of change techniques based on
   self-regulation to promote mental wellbeing. The aim of this
   meta-analysis is to identify effective self-regulation techniques (SRTs)
   in primary and secondary prevention interventions on mental wellbeing in
   adolescents. Forty interventions were included in the analyses.
   Techniques were coded into nine categories of SRTs. Meta-analyses were
   conducted to identify the effectiveness of SRTs, examining three
   different outcomes: internalising behaviour, externalising behaviour,
   and self-esteem. Primary interventions had a small-to-medium (g =
   0.16-0.29) on self-esteem and internalising behaviour. Secondary
   interventions had a medium-to-large short-term effect (average g = 0.56)
   on internalising behaviour and self-esteem. In secondary interventions,
   interventions including asking for social support (g = 1.55, 95\%
   confidence interval, CI = 1.11-1.98) had a great effect on internalising
   behaviour. Interventions including monitoring and evaluation had a
   greater effect on self-esteem (g = 0.39, 95\% CI = 0.21-0.57). For
   primary interventions, there was not a single SRT that was associated
   with a greater intervention effect on internalising behaviour or
   self-esteem. No effects were found for externalising behaviours.
   Self-regulation interventions are moderately effective at improving
   mental wellbeing among adolescents. Secondary interventions promoting `
   asking for social support' and promoting ` monitoring and evaluation'
   were associated with improved outcomes. More research is needed to
   identify other SRTs or combinations of SRTs that could improve
   understanding or optimise mental wellbeing interventions.},

Abstract = {Behaviour change has become a hot topic. We describe a new approach,
   Behaviour Centred Design (BCD), which encompasses a theory of change, a
   suite of behavioural determinants and a programme design process. The
   theory of change is generic, assuming that successful interventions must
   create a cascade of effects via environments, through brains, to
   behaviour and hence to the desired impact, such as improved health.
   Changes in behaviour are viewed as the consequence of a reinforcement
   learning process involving the targeting of evolved motives and changes
   to behaviour settings, and are produced by three types of behavioural
   control mechanism (automatic, motivated and executive). The implications
   are that interventions must create surprise, revalue behaviour and
   disrupt performance in target behaviour settings. We then describe a
   sequence of five steps required to design an intervention to change
   specific behaviours: Assess, Build, Create, Deliver and Evaluate. The
   BCD approach has been shown to change hygiene, nutrition and
   exercise-related behaviours and has the advantages of being applicable
   to product, service or institutional design, as well as being able to
   incorporate future developments in behaviour science. We therefore argue
   that BCD can become the foundation for an applied science of behaviour
   change.},

Abstract = {Much of the global burden of non-communicable disease is caused by
   unhealthy behaviours that individuals enact even when informed of their
   health-harming consequences. A key insight is that these behaviours are
   not predominantly driven by deliberative conscious decisions, but occur
   directly in response to environmental cues and without necessary
   representation of their consequences. Consequently, interventions that
   target non-conscious rather than conscious processes to change health
   behaviour may have significant potential, but this important premise
   remains largely untested. This is in part due to the lack of a
   practicable conceptual framework that can be applied to better describe
   and assess these interventions. We propose a framework for describing or
   categorising interventions to change health behaviour by the degree to
   which their effects may be considered non-conscious. Potential practical
   issues with applying such a framework are discussed, as are the
   implications for further research to inform the testing and development
   of interventions. A pragmatic means of conceptualising interventions
   targeted at non-conscious processes is a necessary prelude to testing
   the potency of such interventions. This can ultimately inform the
   development of interventions with the potential to shape healthier
   behaviours across populations.},

   in preventing excess weight gain in women. However, little is known
   about the implementation, reach, and sustainability of low-intensity
   prevention programs in rural settings, where risk for obesity in women
   is higher than urban settings. We aimed to evaluate a low-intensity
   healthy lifestyle program delivered to women in a rural setting to
   inform development of effective community prevention programs.
   Methods: A mixed method hybrid implementation and evaluation study,
   guided by the RE-AIM framework (addressing the Reach, Effectiveness,
   Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance), was undertaken. Data
   collection tools included anthropometric measures, program checklists,
   questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews with participants and
   local stakeholders. The RE-AIM self-audit tool was applied to assess
   evaluation rigor.
   Results: Six hundred and forty-nine women from 41 relatively
   socio-economic disadvantaged communities in Australia participated: mean
   age 39.6 years (+/- SD 6.7) and body mass index of 28.8 kg/m(2) (+/- SD
   6.9). A betweengroup weight difference of -0.92 kg (95\% CI -1.67 to
   -0.16) showed program effectiveness. Reach was broad across 41 towns
   with 62\% of participants reporting influencing some of the health
   behaviors of their families. Strong implementation fidelity was achieved
   with good retention rates at 1 year (76\%) and high participant
   satisfaction (82\% of participants willing to recommend this program).
   Over 300 multi-level community partnerships were established supporting
   high adoption. Stakeholders reported potential capacity to implement and
   sustain the prevention program in resource poor rural settings, due to
   the low-intensity design and minimal resources required.
   Conclusions: Our comprehensive RE-AIM evaluation demonstrates that an
   evidence-based obesity prevention program can be successfully
   implemented in real-world settings. The program achieved broad reach,
   effectiveness, and satisfaction at the community and stakeholder level,
   revealing potential for program sustainability. The evaluation addressed
   implementation knowledge gaps to support future obesity prevention
   program scale-up.},

Title = {Implementing international sexual counselling guidelines in hospital
   cardiac rehabilitation: development of the CHARMS intervention using the
   Behaviour Change Wheel},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Background: Decreased sexual activity and sexual problems are common
   among people with cardiovascular disease, negatively impacting
   relationship satisfaction and quality of life. International guidelines
   recommend routine delivery of sexual counselling to cardiac patients.
   The Cardiac Health and Relationship Management and Sexuality (CHARMS)
   baseline study in Ireland found, similar to international findings,
   limited implementation of sexual counselling guidelines in practice. The
   aim of the current study was to develop the CHARMS multi-level
   intervention to increase delivery of sexual counselling by healthcare
   professionals. We describe the methods used to develop the CHARMS
   intervention following the three phases of the Behaviour Change Wheel
   approach: understand the behaviour, identify intervention options, and
   identify content and implementation options. Survey (n = 60) and focus
   group (n = 14) data from two previous studies exploring why sexual
   counselling is not currently being delivered were coded by two members
   of the research team to understand staff's capability, opportunity, and
   motivation to engage in the behaviour. All potentially relevant
   intervention functions to change behaviour were identified and the
   APEASE (affordability, practicability, effectiveness, acceptability,
   side effects and equity) criteria were used to select the most
   appropriate. The APEASE criteria were then used to choose between all
   behaviour change techniques (BCTs) potentially relevant to the
   identified functions, and these BCTs were translated into intervention
   content. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication
   (TIDieR) checklist was used to specify details of the intervention
   including the who, what, how and where of proposed intervention
   delivery.
   Results: Providing sexual counselling group sessions by cardiac
   rehabilitation staff to patients during phase III cardiac rehabilitation
   was identified as the target behaviour. Education, enablement,
   modelling, persuasion and training were selected as appropriate
   intervention functions. Twelve BCTs, linked to intervention functions,
   were identified for inclusion and translated into CHARMS intervention
   content.
   Conclusions: This paper details the use of Behaviour Change Wheel
   approach to develop an implementation intervention in an
   under-researched area of healthcare provision. The systematic and
   transparent development of the CHARMS intervention will facilitate the
   evaluation of intervention effectiveness and future replication and
   contribute to the advancement of a cumulative science of implementation
   intervention design.},

Abstract = {The current aim was to examine the effectiveness of behaviour change
   techniques (BCTs), theory and other characteristics in increasing the
   effectiveness of computer-delivered interventions (CDIs) to reduce
   alcohol consumption. Included were randomised studies with a primary aim
   of reducing alcohol consumption, which compared self-directed CDIs to
   assessment-only control groups. CDIs were coded for the use of 42 BCTs
   from an alcohol-specific taxonomy, the use of theory according to a
   theory coding scheme and general characteristics such as length of the
   CDI. Effectiveness of CDIs was assessed using random-effects
   meta-analysis and the association between the moderators and effect size
   was assessed using univariate and multivariate meta-regression.
   Ninety-three CDIs were included in at least one analysis and produced
   small, significant effects on five outcomes (d(+)=0.07-0.15). Larger
   effects occurred with some personal contact, provision of normative
   information or feedback on performance, prompting commitment or goal
   review, the social norms approach and in samples with more women.
   Smaller effects occurred when information on the consequences of alcohol
   consumption was provided. These findings can be used to inform both
   intervention- and theory-development. Intervention developers should
   focus on, including specific, effective techniques, rather than many

Title = {The 1-Year Impact of an Emotion Regulation Intervention on Early

Abstract = {Objective: Sexual activity often begins in early adolescence, and
   adolescents with mental health symptoms are at greater risk for sexual
   activity and other health risks. This study aimed to evaluate a
   developmentally targeted intervention designed to enhance early
   adolescents' emotion regulation competencies as a strategy for reducing
   health risk behaviors, including sexual initiation. Method: Adolescents
   12 to 14 years old (N = 420; 53\% male) with mental health symptoms
   participated in either an emotion regulation (ER) or health promotion
   (HP) intervention consisting of 12 after-school sessions. Participants
   completed questionnaires on laptop computers at baseline, 2-, 6-, and
   12-month follow-ups. Results: Time to event analyses were used to
   compare intervention conditions on rate of initiation to vaginal sex.
   Results showed that participants in the ER condition were less likely to
   transition into vaginal sexual activity by 1-year follow-up than were
   those in the HP condition (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.58, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}0.36, 0.94], p = .01). However, those who were sexually
   active did not report differences in sexual risk behaviors (e.g.,
   condomless sex). Participants in the ER condition were significantly
   less likely to report violence behaviors and showed improvement on a
   behavioral measure of emotion identification; however, they did not
   differ from HP participants on self-reports of emotional competence.
   Conclusions: Emotion regulation strategies can be used to delay sexual
   initiation among early adolescents with mental health symptoms and may
   have an important role in health education.},

Title = {A taxonomy of behaviour change methods: an Intervention Mapping approach},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the Intervention Mapping (IM) taxonomy of
   behaviour change methods and its potential to be developed into a coding
   taxonomy. That is, although IM and its taxonomy of behaviour change
   methods are not in fact new, because IM was originally developed as a
   tool for intervention development, this potential was not immediately
   apparent. Second, in explaining the IM taxonomy and defining the
   relevant constructs, we call attention to the existence of parameters
   for effectiveness of methods, and explicate the related distinction
   between theory-based methods and practical applications and the
   probability that poor translation of methods may lead to erroneous
   conclusions as to method-effectiveness. Third, we recommend a minimal
   set of intervention characteristics that may be reported when
   intervention descriptions and evaluations are published. Specifying
   these characteristics can greatly enhance the quality of our
   meta-analyses and other literature syntheses. In conclusion, the
   dynamics of behaviour change are such that any taxonomy of methods of
   behaviour change needs to acknowledge the importance of, and provide
   instruments for dealing with, three conditions for effectiveness for
   behaviour change methods. For a behaviour change method to be effective:
   (1) it must target a determinant that predicts behaviour; (2) it must be
   able to change that determinant; (3) it must be translated into a
   practical application in a way that preserves the parameters for
   effectiveness and fits with the target population, culture, and context.
   Thus, taxonomies of methods of behaviour change must distinguish the
   specific determinants that are targeted, practical, specific
   applications, and the theory-based methods they embody. In addition,
   taxonomies should acknowledge that the lists of behaviour change methods
   will be used by, and should be used by, intervention developers.
   Ideally, the taxonomy should be readily usable for this goal; but
   alternatively, it should be clear how the information in the taxonomy
   can be used in practice. The IM taxonomy satisfies these requirements,
   and it would be beneficial if other taxonomies would be extended to also
   meet these needs.},

Abstract = {Background: Behaviour change interventions are effective in supporting
   individuals in achieving temporary behaviour change. Behaviour change
   maintenance, however, is rarely attained. The aim of this review was to
   identify and synthesise current theoretical explanations for behaviour
   change maintenance to inform future research and practice.Methods:
   Potentially relevant theories were identified through systematic
   searches of electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO). In
   addition, an existing database of 80 theories was searched, and 25
   theory experts were consulted. Theories were included if they formulated
   hypotheses about behaviour change maintenance. Included theories were
   synthesised thematically to ascertain overarching explanations for
   behaviour change maintenance. Initial theoretical themes were
   cross-validated.Findings: One hundred and seventeen behaviour theories
   were identified, of which 100 met the inclusion criteria. Five
   overarching, interconnected themes representing theoretical explanations
   for behaviour change maintenance emerged. Theoretical explanations of
   behaviour change maintenance focus on the differential nature and role
   of motives, self-regulation, resources (psychological and physical),
   habits, and environmental and social influences from initiation to
   maintenance.Discussion: There are distinct patterns of theoretical
   explanations for behaviour change and for behaviour change maintenance.
   The findings from this review can guide the development and evaluation
   of interventions promoting maintenance of health behaviours and help in
   the development of an integrated theory of behaviour change maintenance.},

Title = {Self-directed interventions to promote weight loss: a systematic review
   and meta-analysis},

Abstract = {Many self-directed weight-loss interventions have been developed using a
   variety of delivery formats (e.g., internet and smartphone) and change
   techniques. Yet, little research has examined whether self-directed
   interventions can exclusively promote weight loss. MEDLINE, Embase,
   PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were systematically reviewed
   for randomised controlled trials evaluating self-directed interventions
   in relation to weight-loss outcomes in adults. Standardised mean
   differences (SMD) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated
   using a random effects model. Twenty-seven trials incorporating 36
   comparisons met our inclusion criteria. Participants using self-directed
   interventions lost significantly more weight (MD=-1.56kg, CI -2.25,
   -0.86 ranging from 0.6 to 5.3kg) compared to those in the minimal
   intervention or no-treatment groups (3.1-month follow-up median). The
   majority of interventions were internet based (18 evaluations) and these
   were effective at 3 months (MD=-1.74kg, CI -2.65, -0.82 ranging from 0.6
   to 4.8kg) (SMD=-0.48, 95\% CI -0.72, -0.24, I-2=82\%; p<.0001; 16
   evaluations) and 6 months follow-up (MD=-2.71kg, CI -4.03, -1.39 ranging
   from 2.2 to 5.3kg) (SMD=-0.59, 95\% CI -0.99, -0.19, I-2=76\%; p=.004; 4
   evaluations). Self-directed weight-loss interventions can generate
   modest weight loss for up to 6 months but may need to be supplemented by
   other interventions to achieve sustained and clinically meaningful
   weight loss.},

Title = {A Randomized Controlled Trial of Web-Based Attentional Bias Modification
   to Help Smokers Quit},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {Objective: To assess the efficacy of a multiple-sessions Web-based
   Attentional Bias Modification (ABM) self-help intervention in 434
   smokers who made a quit-attempt. Method: Respondents were randomized to
   receive 6 sessions of ABM-or placebo-training in a period of 2 weeks.
   Smoking-related cognitions (e. g., self-efficacy and intention to quit)
   and cognitive biases (i. e., attentional and approach bias) for
   smoking-cues were assessed before training (pretest). Primary
   outcome-variable was continued abstinence, 6 months after baseline. Bias
   reduction at the posttraining assessment was the secondary outcome. A 2
   x 2 mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) and logistic regression analyses
   were conducted using the whole sample (N = 434) as well as subsamples of
   light to moderate smokers (<15 cigarettes, N = 115) and heavy smokers
   (15 or more cigarettes, N = 319). Conservative analyses (coding
   drop-outs as smokers) as well as complete case analyses were conducted.
   Results: The ABM training had no significant effect regarding bias
   reduction and no behavioral effects in the whole sample of smokers.
   Subsample analyses revealed a significant positive effect on continued
   abstinence in heavy smokers only (complete case analyses: odds ratio
   {[}OR] = 3.15; p = .02; confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.24-7.99;
   conservative analyses: OR = 2.49; p = .02; CI = 1.13-5.48). Conclusion:
   Web-based ABM training is ineffective in fostering cognitive bias
   reduction and continued smoking abstinence. However, the positive
   effects in heavy smokers-as indicated by exploratory subsample
   analyses-warrant further research into the potential of multiple
   sessions ABM training to foster continued smoking abstinence in heavy
   smokers who make a quit-attempt.},

Abstract = {Objective: This systematic review aimed to (a) identify and categorize
   techniques used to modify or manage impulsive processes associated with
   unhealthy eating behavior, (b) describe the mechanisms targeted by such
   techniques, and (c) summarize available evidence on the effectiveness of
   these techniques. Method: Searches of 5 bibliographic databases
   identified studies, published in English since 1993, that evaluated at
   least 1 technique to modify impulsive processes affecting eating in
   adults. Data were systematically extracted on study characteristics,
   population, study quality, intervention techniques, proposed mechanisms
   of action, and outcomes. Effectiveness evidence was systematically
   collated and described without meta-analysis. Results: Ninety-two
   studies evaluated 17 distinct impulse management techniques. They were
   categorized according to whether they aimed to (a) modify the strength
   of impulses or (b) engage the reflective system or other resources in
   identifying, suppressing, or otherwise managing impulses. Although
   higher quality evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions,
   promising changes in unhealthy food consumption and food cravings were
   observed for visuospatial loading, physical activity, and if-then
   planning, typically for up to 1-day follow-up. Conclusions: A wide range
   of techniques have been evaluated and some show promise for use in
   weight management interventions. However, larger-scale, more
   methodologically robust, community-based studies with longer follow-up
   times are needed to establish whether such techniques can have a
   long-term impact on eating patterns.},

Abstract = {Background: Despite substantial evidence for physical activity (PA) as a
   management option for type 2 diabetes, there remains a lack of PA
   behavioural interventions suitable for delivery in primary care. This
   paper describes the systematic development of an evidence informed PA
   behavioural intervention for use during routine primary care
   consultations.
   Methods: In accordance with the Medical Research Council Framework for
   the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions, a four-stage
   systematic development process was undertaken: (1) exploratory work
   involving interviews and workshop discussions identified training needs
   of healthcare professionals and support needs of adults with type 2
   diabetes; (2) a systematic review with meta- and moderator analyses
   identified behaviour change techniques and optimal intervention
   intensity and duration; (3) usability testing identified strategies to
   increase implementation of the intervention in primary care and (4) an
   open pilot study in two primary care practices facilitated intervention
   optimisation.
   Results: Healthcare professional training needs included knowledge about
   type, intensity and duration of PA sufficient to improve glycaemic
   control and acquisition of skills to promote PA behaviour change.
   Patients lacked knowledge about type 2 diabetes and skills to enable
   them to make sustainable changes to their level of PA. An accredited
   online training programme for healthcare professionals and a
   professional-delivered behavioural intervention for adults with type 2
   diabetes were subsequently developed. This multifaceted intervention was
   informed by the theory of planned behaviour and social cognitive theory
   and consisted of 15 behaviour change techniques. Intervention intensity
   and duration were informed by a systematic review. Usability testing
   resolved technical problems with the online training intervention that
   facilitated use on practice IT systems. An open pilot study of the
   intervention with fidelity of delivery assessment informed optimisation
   and identified mechanisms to enhance implementation of the intervention
   during routine diabetes consultations.
   Conclusions: Movement as Medicine for Type 2 diabetes represents an
   evidence-informed multifaceted behavioural intervention targeting PA for
   management of type 2 diabetes developed for delivery in primacy care.
   The structured development process undertaken enhances transparency of
   intervention content, replicability and scalability. Movement as
   Medicine for Type 2 diabetes is currently undergoing evaluation in a
   pilot RCT.},

   improvement approach to tailoring VA Patient Aligned Care Teams to the
   needs of women Veterans},

Abstract = {Background: The Veterans Health Administration (VA) has undertaken a
   major initiative to transform care through implementation of Patient
   Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). Based on the patient-centered medical home
   (PCMH) concept, PACT aims to improve access, continuity, coordination,
   and comprehensiveness using team-based care that is patient-driven and
   patient-centered. However, how VA should adapt PACT to meet the needs of
   special populations, such as women Veterans (WVs), was not considered in
   initial implementation guidance. WVs' numerical minority in VA
   healthcare settings (approximately 7-8 \% of users) creates logistical
   challenges to delivering gender-sensitive comprehensive care. The main
   goal of this study is to test an evidence-based quality improvement
   approach (EBQI) to tailoring PACT to meet the needs of WVs,
   incorporating comprehensive primary care services and gender-specific
   care in gender-sensitive environments, thereby accelerating achievement
   of PACT tenets for women (Women's Health (WH)-PACT).
   Methods/design: EBQI is a systematic approach to developing a multilevel
   research-clinical partnership that engages senior organizational leaders
   and local quality improvement (QI) teams in adapting and implementing
   new care models in the context of prior evidence and local practice
   conditions, with researchers providing technical support, formative
   feedback, and practice facilitation. In a 12-site cluster randomized
   trial, we will evaluate WH-PACT model achievement using patient,
   provider, staff, and practice surveys, in addition to analyses of
   secondary administrative and chart-based data. We will explore impacts
   of receipt of WH-PACT care on quality of chronic disease care and
   prevention, health status, patient satisfaction and experience of care,
   provider experience, utilization, and costs. Using mixed methods, we
   will assess pre-post practice contexts; document EBQI activities
   undertaken in participating facilities and their relationship to
   provider/staff and team actions/attitudes; document WH-PACT
   implementation; and examine barriers/facilitators to EBQI-supported
   WH-PACT implementation through a combination of semi-structured
   interviews and monthly formative progress narratives and administrative
   data.
   Discussion: Lack of gender-sensitive comprehensive care has demonstrated
   consequences for the technical quality and ratings of care among WVs and
   may contribute to decisions to continue use or seek care elsewhere under
   the US Affordable Care Act. We hypothesize that tailoring PACT
   implementation through EBQI may improve the experience and quality of
   care at many levels.},

Title = {Impact of primary healthcare providers' initial role security and
   therapeutic commitment on implementing brief interventions in managing
   risky alcohol consumption: a cluster randomised factorial trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},

Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Background: Brief interventions in primary healthcare are cost-effective
   in reducing drinking problems but poorly implemented in routine
   practice. Although evidence about implementing brief interventions is
   growing, knowledge is limited with regard to impact of initial role
   security and therapeutic commitment on brief intervention
   implementation.
   Methods: In a cluster randomised factorial trial, 120 primary healthcare
   units (PHCUs) were randomised to eight groups: care as usual, training
   and support, financial reimbursement, and the opportunity to refer
   patients to an internet-based brief intervention (e-BI); paired
   combinations of these three strategies, and all three strategies
   combined. To explore the impact of initial role security and therapeutic
   commitment on implementing brief interventions, we performed multilevel
   linear regression analyses adapted to the factorial design.
   Results: Data from 746 providers from 120 PHCUs were included in the
   analyses. Baseline role security and therapeutic commitment were found
   not to influence implementation of brief interventions. Furthermore,
   there were no significant interactions between these characteristics and
   allocated implementation groups.
   Conclusions: The extent to which providers changed their brief
   intervention delivery following experience of different implementation
   strategies was not determined by their initial attitudes towards alcohol
   problems. In future research, more attention is needed to unravel the
   causal relation between practitioners' attitudes, their actual behaviour
   and care improvement strategies to enhance implementation science.},

Title = {A modified theoretical framework to assess implementation fidelity of
   adaptive public health interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Background: One of the major debates in implementation research turns
   around fidelity and adaptation. Fidelity is the degree to which an
   intervention is implemented as intended by its developers. It is meant
   to ensure that the intervention maintains its intended effects.
   Adaptation is the process of implementers or users bringing changes to
   the original design of an intervention. Depending on the nature of the
   modifications brought, adaptation could either be potentially positive
   or could carry the risk of threatening the theoretical basis of the
   intervention, resulting in a negative effect on expected outcomes.
   Adaptive interventions are those for which adaptation is allowed or even
   encouraged. Classical fidelity dimensions and conceptual frameworks do
   not address the issue of how to adapt an intervention while still
   maintaining its effectiveness.
   Discussion: We support the idea that fidelity and adaptation co-exist
   and that adaptations can impact either positively or negatively on the
   intervention's effectiveness. For adaptive interventions, research
   should answer the question how an adequate fidelity-adaptation balance
   can be reached. One way to address this issue is by looking
   systematically at the aspects of an intervention that are being adapted.
   We conducted fidelity research on the implementation of an empowerment
   strategy for dengue prevention in Cuba. In view of the adaptive nature
   of the strategy, we anticipated that the classical fidelity dimensions
   would be of limited use for assessing adaptations. The typology we used
   in the assessment-implemented, not-implemented, modified, or added
   components of the strategy-also had limitations. It did not allow us to
   answer the question which of the modifications introduced in the
   strategy contributed to or distracted from outcomes. We confronted our
   empirical research with existing literature on fidelity, and as a
   result, considered that the framework for implementation fidelity
   proposed by Carroll et al. in 2007 could potentially meet our concerns.
   We propose modifications to the framework to assess both fidelity and
   adaptation.
   Summary: The modified Carroll et al.'s framework we propose may permit a
   comprehensive assessment of the implementation fidelity-adaptation
   balance required when implementing adaptive interventions, but more
   empirical research is needed to validate it.},

Title = {A Road Paved With Safe Intentions: Increasing Intentions to Use Alcohol

Abstract = {Objective: Drinking remains a problem across college campuses. Changing
   this behavior requires interventions that can be easily and widely
   dispersed. Several theories place intentions as a proximal predictor of
   behavior change. The current study examines the effects of a Web-based
   Deviance Regulation Theory (DRT) intervention on (1) intentions to use
   alcohol protective behavior strategies (PBS) and (2) associations
   between these intentions and actual behavior. Method: Participants (n =
   76) completed a 6-week, Web-based study examining drinking behaviors.
   Participants were randomly assigned to receive a positive frame about
   individuals who use PBS or a negative frame about individuals who do
   not. They also reported normative perceptions of PBS use among college
   students. They subsequently logged onto a secure server each week to
   report on alcohol involvement, use of 3 types of PBS (Manner of
   Drinking, Stopping/Limiting, and Serious Harm Reduction), and intentions
   to use these PBS the following week. Results: Consistent with DRT,
   negative frames resulted in higher PBS use intentions if individuals
   held high normative beliefs about PBS use. Positive frames resulted in
   higher Manner of Drinking PBS use intentions if individuals held low
   normative beliefs about PBS use, but only if individuals endorsed a high
   belief in the frame. In addition, there was a DRT consistent increase in
   intention-action associations, but only for Stopping/Limiting PBS.
   Discussion: A brief Web-based DRT intervention was effective at
   increasing PBS intentions and increasing PBS intention-action
   associations. DRT may provide a mechanism to additively or
   synergistically improve other Web-based interventions for college
   drinking.},

Title = {Enhancing Physical Function in HIV-Infected Older Adults: A Randomized

Abstract = {Objective: HIV-infected older adults (HOA) are at risk of functional
   decline. Interventions promoting physical activity that can attenuate
   functional decline and are easily translated into the HOA community are
   of high priority. We conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial
   to evaluate whether a physical activity counseling intervention based on
   self-determination theory (SDT) improves physical function, autonomous
   motivation, depression and the quality of life (QOL) in HOA. Method: In
   total, 67 community-dwelling HOA with mild-to-moderate functional
   limitations were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: a physical activity
   counseling group or the usual care control group. We used SDT to guide
   the development of the experimental intervention. Outcome measures that
   were collected at baseline and final study visits included a battery of
   physical function tests, levels of physical activity, autonomous
   motivation, depression, and QOL. Results: The study participants were
   similar in their demographic and clinical characteristics in both the
   treatment and control groups. Overall physical performance, gait speed,
   measures of endurance and strength, and levels of physical activity
   improved in the treatment group compared to the control group (p < .05).
   Measures of autonomous regulation such as identified regulation, and
   measures of depression and QOL improved significantly in the treatment
   group compared with the control group (p < .05). Across the groups,
   improvement in intrinsic regulation and QOL correlated with an
   improvement in physical function (p < .05). Conclusion: Our findings
   suggest that a physical activity counseling program grounded in SDT can
   improve physical function, autonomous motivation, depression, and QOL in
   HOA with functional limitations.},

Abstract = {Background: In 2009, Damschroder et al. developed the Consolidated
   Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), which provides a
   comprehensive listing of constructs thought to influence implementation.
   This systematic review assesses the extent to which the CFIR's use in
   implementation research fulfills goals set forth by Damschroder et al.
   in terms of breadth of use, depth of application, and contribution to
   implementation research.
   Methods: We searched Scopus and Web of Science for publications that
   cited the original CFIR publication by Damschroder et al. (Implement Sci
   4:50, 2009) and downloaded each unique result for review. After applying
   exclusion criteria, the final articles were empirical studies published
   in peer-review journals that used the CFIR in a meaningful way (i.e.,
   used the CFIR to guide data collection, measurement, coding, analysis,
   and/or reporting). A framework analysis approach was used to guide
   abstraction and synthesis of the included articles.
   Results: Twenty-six of 429 unique articles (6 \%) met inclusion
   criteria. We found great breadth in CFIR application; the CFIR was
   applied across a wide variety of study objectives, settings, and units
   of analysis. There was also variation in the method of included studies
   (mixed methods (n = 13); qualitative (n = 10); quantitative (n = 3)).
   Depth of CFIR application revealed some areas for improvement. Few
   studies (n = 3) reported justification for selection of CFIR constructs
   used; the majority of studies (n = 14) used the CFIR to guide data
   analysis only; and few studies investigated any outcomes (n = 11).
   Finally, reflections on the contribution of the CFIR to implementation
   research were scarce.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that the CFIR has been used across a
   wide range of studies, though more in-depth use of the CFIR may help
   advance implementation science. To harness its potential, researchers
   should consider how to most meaningfully use the CFIR. Specific
   recommendations for applying the CFIR include explicitly justifying
   selection of CFIR constructs; integrating the CFIR throughout the
   research process (in study design, data collection, and analysis); and
   appropriately using the CFIR given the phase of implementation of the
   research (e.g., if the research is post-implementation, using the CFIR
   to link determinants of implementation to outcomes).},

Title = {Using theory of change to design and evaluate public health
   interventions: a systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the increasing popularity of the theory of change
   (ToC) approach, little is known about the extent to which ToC has been
   used in the design and evaluation of public health interventions. This
   review aims to determine how ToCs have been developed and used in the
   development and evaluation of public health interventions globally.
   Methods: We searched for papers reporting the use of ``theory of
   change{''} in the development or evaluation of public health
   interventions in databases of peer-reviewed journal articles such as
   Scopus, Pubmed, PsychInfo, grey literature databases, Google and
   websites of development funders. We included papers of any date,
   language or study design. Both abstracts and full text papers were
   double screened. Data were extracted and narratively and quantitatively
   summarised.
   Results: A total of 62 papers were included in the review. Forty-nine
   (79 \%) described the development of ToC, 18 (29 \%) described the use
   of ToC in the development of the intervention and 49 (79 \%) described
   the use of ToC in the evaluation of the intervention. Although a large
   number of papers were included in the review, their descriptions of the
   ToC development and use in intervention design and evaluation lacked
   detail.
   Conclusions: The use of the ToC approach is widespread in the public
   health literature. Clear reporting of the ToC process and outputs is
   important to strengthen the body of literature on practical application
   of ToC in order to develop our understanding of the benefits and
   advantages of using ToC. We also propose a checklist for reporting on
   the use of ToC to ensure transparent reporting and recommend that our
   checklist is used and refined by authors reporting the ToC approach.},

Title = {Using intervention mapping to develop a home-based parental-supervised
   toothbrushing intervention for young children},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Background: Dental caries in young children is a major public health
   problem impacting on the child and their family in terms of pain,
   infection and substantial financial burden on healthcare funders. In the
   UK, national guidance on the prevention of dental caries advises parents
   to supervise their child's brushing with fluoride toothpaste until age
   7. However, there is a dearth of evidence-based interventions to
   encourage this practice in parents. The current study used intervention
   mapping (IM) to develop a home-based parental-supervised toothbrushing
   intervention to reduce dental caries in young children.
   Methods: The intervention was developed using the six key stages of the
   IM protocol: (1) needs assessment, including a systematic review,
   qualitative interviews, and meetings with a multi-disciplinary
   intervention development group; (2) identification of outcomes and
   change objectives following identification of the barriers to
   parental-supervised toothbrushing (PSB), mapped alongside psychological
   determinants outlined in the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF); (3)
   selection of methods and practical strategies; (4) production of a
   programme plan; (5) adoption and implementation and (6) Evaluation.
   Results: The comprehensive needs assessment highlighted key barriers to
   PSB, such as knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, routine setting and
   behaviour regulation and underlined the importance of individual, social
   and structural influences. Parenting skills (routine setting and the
   ability to manage the behaviour of a reluctant child) were emphasised as
   critical to the success of PSB. The multi-disciplinary intervention
   development group highlighted the need for both universal and targeted
   programmes, which could be implemented within current provision. Two
   intervention pathways were developed: a lower cost universal pathway
   utilising an existing national programme and an intensive targeted
   programme delivered via existing parenting programmes. A training manual
   was created to accompany each intervention to ensure knowledge and
   standardise implementation procedures.
   Conclusions: PSB is a complex behaviour and requires intervention across
   individual, social and structural levels. IM, although a time-consuming
   process, allowed us to capture this complexity and allowed us to develop
   two community-based intervention pathways covering both universal and
   targeted approaches, which can be integrated into current provision.
   Further research is needed to evaluate the acceptability and
   sustainability of these interventions.},

Title = {The 4KEEPS study: identifying predictors of sustainment of multiple
   practices fiscally mandated in children's mental health services},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Background: Research to date has largely focused on predictors of
   adoption and initial implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs),
   yet sustained implementation is crucial to deliver a return on
   investments in dissemination. Furthermore, most studies focus on single
   EBPs, limiting opportunities to study the fit between practice
   characteristics EBPs and implementation contexts.
   Methods/design: This observational study will characterize
   implementation sustainment and identify organizational and therapist
   characteristics that predict sustainment of multiple practices being
   implemented within a fiscal mandate in the largest public mental health
   system in the USA. Specific aims are to (1) characterize sustainment
   outcomes (volume/penetration, EBP concordant care); (2) use mixed
   methods to characterize inner context (agency-and therapist-level)
   factors and early implementation conditions; and (3) identify inner
   context factors and early implementation conditions that predict
   sustainment outcomes. This study will undertake original data collection
   and analysis of existing data sources to achieve its aims. Archived
   reports and documents will be used to characterize early implementation
   conditions in 102 agencies. Administrative claims data will be used to
   characterize volume and penetration outcomes over 8 years. Therapist and
   program manager surveys will be administered to characterize sustained
   EBP concordant care and inner context determinants of sustainment. An
   in-depth study in a subset of agencies will yield interview data and
   recordings of treatment sessions for validation of the EBP concordant
   care scale.
   Discussion: This project will yield new understanding of whether and how
   multiple EBPs can be sustained in public mental health systems
   undergoing a policy-driven community implementation effort. We will
   produce generalizable models for characterizing sustainment, including
   feasible and flexible measurement of practice across multiple EBPs. The
   findings will inform the development of implementation interventions to
   promote sustained delivery of EBPs to maximize their public health
   impact.},

Abstract = {Objective: Evaluations of techniques to promote physical activity
   usually adopt a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Such designs inform
   how a technique performs on average but cannot be used for treatment of
   individuals. Our objective was to conduct the first N-of-1 RCTs of
   behaviour change techniques with older people and test the effectiveness
   of the techniques for increasing walking within individuals.Design:
   Eight adults aged 60-87 were randomised to a 2 (goal-setting vs. active
   control) x 2 (self-monitoring vs. active control) factorial RCT over
   62days. The time series data were analysed for each single case using
   linear regressions.Main outcome measures: Walking was objectively
   measured using pedometers.Results: Compared to control days,
   goal-setting increased walking in 4 out of 8 individuals and
   self-monitoring increased walking in 7 out of 8 individuals. While the
   probability for self-monitoring to be effective in 7 out of 8
   participants was beyond chance (p=.03), no intervention effect was
   significant for individual participants. Two participants had a
   significant but small linear decrease in walking over time.Conclusion:
   We demonstrate the utility of N-of-1 trials for advancing scientific
   enquiry of behaviour change and in practice for increasing older
   people's physical activity.},

Title = {Implementing a social network intervention designed to enhance and
   diversify support for people with long-term conditions. A qualitative
   study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 29},
Abstract = {Background: For people with long-term conditions, social networks
   provide a potentially central means of mobilising, mediating and
   accessing support for health and well-being. Few interventions address
   the implementation of improving engagement with and through social
   networks. This paper describes the development and implementation of a
   web-based tool which comprises: network mapping, user-centred preference
   elicitation and need assessment and facilitated engagement with
   resources. The study aimed to determine whether the intervention was
   acceptable, implementable and acted to enhance support and to add to
   theory concerning social networks and engagement with resources and
   activities.
   Methods: A longitudinal design with 15 case studies used ethnographic
   methods comprising video, non-participant observation of intervention
   delivery and qualitative interviews (baseline, 6 and 12 months).
   Participants were people with type 2 diabetes living in a marginalised
   island community. Facilitators were local health trainers and care
   navigators. Analysis applied concepts concerning implementation of
   technology for self-management support to explain how new practices of
   work were operationalised and how the technology impacted on
   relationships fit with everyday life and allowed for visual feedback.
   Results: Most participants reported identifying and taking up new
   activities as a result of using the tool. Thematic analysis suggested
   that workability of the tool was predicated on disruption and
   reconstruction of networks, challenging/supportive facilitation and
   change and reflection over time concerning network support.
   Visualisation of the network enabled people to mobilise support and
   engage in new activities. The tool aligned synergistically with the
   facilitators' role of linking people to local resources.
   Conclusions: The social network tool works through a process of
   initiating positive disruption of established selfmanagement practice
   through mapping and reflection on personal network membership and
   support. This opens up possibilities for reconstructing self-management
   differently from current practice. Key facets of successful
   implementation were: the visual maps of networks and support options;
   facilitation characterised by a perceived lack of status difference
   which assisted engagement and constructive discussion of support and
   preferences for activities; and background work (a reliable database,
   tailored preferences, option reduction) for facilitator and user ease of
   use.},

Abstract = {Objectives: The home-based smoking prevention programme Smoke-free Kids'
   did not have an effect on primary outcome smoking initiation. A possible
   explanation may be that the programme has a delayed effect. The aim of
   this study was to evaluate the effects on the development of important
   precursors of smoking: smoking-related cognitions.Methods: We used a
   cluster randomised controlled trial in 9- to 11-year-old children and
   their mothers. The intervention condition received five activity
   modules, including a communication sheet for mothers, by mail at
   four-week intervals. The control condition received a fact-based
   programme. Secondary outcomes were attitudes, self-efficacy and social
   norms. Latent growth curves analyses were used to calculate the
   development of cognitions over time. Subsequently, path modelling was
   used to estimate the programme effects on the initial level and growth
   of each cognition.Results: Analyses were performed on 1398 never-smoking
   children at baseline. Results showed that for children in the
   intervention condition, perceived maternal norms increased less strongly
   as compared to the control condition (=-.10, p=.03). No effects were
   found for the other cognitions.Conclusion: Based on the limited effects,
   we do not assume that the programme will have a delayed effect on
   smoking behaviour later during adolescence.},

Abstract = {Sedentary behaviour - i.e., low energy-expending waking behaviour while
   seated or lying down - is a health risk factor, even when controlling
   for physical activity. This review sought to describe the behaviour
   change strategies used within interventions that have sought to reduce
   sedentary behaviour in adults. Studies were identified through existing
   literature reviews, a systematic database search, and hand-searches of
   eligible papers. Interventions were categorised as very promising',
   quite promising', or non-promising' according to observed behaviour
   changes. Intervention functions and behaviour change techniques were
   compared across promising and non-promising interventions. Twenty-six
   eligible studies reported thirty-eight interventions, of which twenty
   (53\%) were worksite-based. Fifteen interventions (39\%) were very
   promising, eight quite promising (21\%), and fifteen non-promising
   (39\%). Very or quite promising interventions tended to have targeted
   sedentary behaviour instead of physical activity. Interventions based on
   environmental restructuring, persuasion, or education were most
   promising. Self-monitoring, problem solving, and restructuring the
   social or physical environment were particularly promising behaviour
   change techniques. Future sedentary reduction interventions might most
   fruitfully incorporate environmental modification and self-regulatory
   skills training. The evidence base is, however, weakened by low-quality
   evaluation methods; more RCTs, employing no-treatment control groups,
   and collecting objective data are needed.},

Title = {Does inhibitory control training improve health behaviour? A
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW},

Pages = {168-186},
Abstract = {Objectives: Inhibitory control training has been hypothesised as a
   technique that will improve an individual's ability to overrule
   impulsive reactions in order to regulate behaviour consistent with
   long-term goals. Methods: A meta-analysis of 19 studies of inhibitory
   control training and health behaviours was conducted to determine the
   effect of inhibitory control training on reducing harmful behaviours.
   Theoretically driven moderation analyses were also conducted to
   determine whether extraneous variables account for heterogeneity in the
   effect; in order to facilitate the development of effective intervention
   strategies. Moderators included type of training task, behaviour
   targeted, measurement of behaviour and training duration. Results: A
   small but homogeneous effect of training on behaviour was found, d(+) =
   0.378, CI95 = {[}0.258, 0.498]. Moderation analyses revealed that the
   training paradigm adopted, and measurement type influenced the size of
   the effect such that larger effects were found for studies that employed
   go/no-go (GNG) training paradigms rather than stop-signal task
   paradigms, and objective outcome measures that were administered
   immediately yielded the largest and most consistent effects on
   behaviour. Conclusions: Results suggest that GNG inhibitory control
   training paradigms can influence health behaviour, but perhaps only in
   the short-term. Future research is required to systematically examine
   the influence of training duration, and the longevity of the training
   effect. Determining these factors could provide the basis for
   cost-effective and efficacious health-promoting interventions.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study explores whether a web-based physical activity
   (PA) intervention grounded in self-determination theory(SDT) and
   motivational interviewing (MI) is more effective and better appreciated
   than a traditional web-based PA intervention.Design: A randomized
   controlled trial was conducted, comparing (1) I Move; a web-based PA
   intervention based on SDT and MI, (2) Active Plus; a traditional
   web-based PA intervention and (3) a waiting list control condition.Main
   outcome measures: Weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous PA and weekly
   days with30 min PA were measured through self-report at baseline and at
   3 and 6months from baseline.Results: I Move achieved a small, but
   significant increase in weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous PA, while
   Active Plus did not have a significant impact on this outcome. Both
   interventions were effective in increasing weekly days with30 min PA,
   whereas Active Plus yielded a greater effect on this outcome.Conclusion:
   Overall, the web-based PA intervention grounded in SDTand MI did not
   outperform the traditional web-based PA intervention. Further research
   should reveal whether this type of intervention is profitable for
   long-term maintenance of PA levels.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the preliminary effect
   of a behavioral intervention on the use of self-regulation strategies
   and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in overweight and
   obese adults with type 2 diabetes. 23 individuals recruited from
   ResearchMatc.org and campus advertisements were randomized into an
   intervention (n=12) and control (n=11) group. The intervention group
   received a behavioral intervention that used goal setting, time
   management, and self-monitoring to target dimensions of self-regulation
   and MVPA. The control received information regarding their PA habits.
   MVPA was measured via BodyMedia Armbands at pre- and post-test. The use
   of self-regulatory strategies for MVPA was assessed at pretest and
   posttest using the Self-Regulation for Exercise Scale. Cohen's d effect
   sizes were calculated to determine the practical impact of the
   intervention. The intervention had a large effect on all dimensions of
   self-regulation across time: including total self-regulation (3.15),
   self-monitoring (4.63), goal setting (3.17), social support (1.29),
   self-reward (1.98), time management (4.41), and overcoming barriers
   (2.25). The intervention had no impact on dimensions of MVPA across
   time. This pilot study demonstrated the ability of a behavioral
   intervention to improve the use of self-regulation strategies for MVPA
   in a sample of adults with type 2 diabetes. These findings can further
   inform the development of health promotion programs to promote
   self-regulation. Future research should focus on determining ability of
   improvements in self-regulation to stimulate behavior change.},

Abstract = {Advances in wireless devices and mobile technology offer many
   opportunities for delivering just-in-time adaptive interventions
   (JITAIs)-suites of interventions that adapt over time to an individual's
   changing status and circumstances with the goal to address the
   individual's need for support, whenever this need arises. A major
   challenge confronting behavioral scientists aiming to develop a JITAI
   concerns the selection and integration of existing empirical,
   theoretical and practical evidence into a scientific model that can
   inform the construction of a JITAI and help identify scientific gaps.
   The purpose of this paper is to establish a pragmatic framework that can
   be used to organize existing evidence into a useful model for JITAI
   construction. This framework involves clarifying the conceptual purpose
   of a JITAI, namely, the provision of just-in-time support via
   adaptation, as well as describing the components of a JITAI and
   articulating a list of concrete questions to guide the establishment of
   a useful model for JITAI construction. The proposed framework includes
   an organizing scheme for translating the relatively static scientific
   models underlying many health behavior interventions into a more dynamic
   model that better incorporates the element of time. This framework will
   help to guide the next generation of empirical work to support the
   creation of effective JITAIs.},

Abstract = {Objective: Active video games (AVGs) transform the sedentary screen time
   of video gaming into active screen time and have great potential to
   serve as a ``gateway{''} tool to a more active lifestyle for the least
   active individuals. This pilot randomized trial was conducted to explore
   the potential of theory-guided active video games in increasing
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among young adults.
   Method: In this pilot 4-week intervention, participants were randomly
   assigned to 1 of the following groups: an AVG group with all the self
   determination theory (SDT)-based game features turned off, an AVG group
   with all the SDT-based game features turned on, a passive gameplay group
   with all the SDT-based game features turned on, and a control group.
   Physical activity was measured using ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers.
   Other outcomes included attendance and perceived need satisfaction of
   autonomy, competence and relatedness. Results: It was found that playing
   the self-determination theory supported AVG resulted in greater MVPA
   compared with the control group immediately postintervention. The AVG
   with the theory-supported features also resulted in greater attendance
   and psychological need satisfaction than the non-theory-supported one.
   Conclusion: An AVG designed with motivation theory informed features
   positively impacted attendance and MVPA immediately postintervention,
   suggesting that including AVG features guided with motivation theory may
   be a method of addressing common problems with adherence and increasing
   effectiveness of active gaming.},

Abstract = {Content, delivery and effects of physical activity (PA) interventions
   are heterogeneous. There is a need to identify intervention features
   (content and delivery) related to long-term effectiveness. Behaviour
   change techniques (BCTs) and modes of intervention delivery were coded
   in 19 randomised controlled trials included in a systematic review of PA
   interventions for adults aged 55-70 years, published between 2000 and
   2010, with PA outcomes 12 months after randomisation; protocol
   registration: PROSPERO CRD42011001459. Meta-analysis, moderator analyses
   and meta-regression were conducted. Meta-analysis revealed that
   interventions were effective in promoting PA compared with no/minimal
   intervention comparators {[}d = 0.29, 95\% CI = 0.19-0.40, I-2 = 79.8\%,
   Q-value = 89.16 (df = 18, p < 0.01)]. Intervention features often
   concurred and goal setting was the most commonly used BCT. Subgroup
   analyses suggested that interventions using the BCT feedback may be more
   effective, whilst interventions using printed materials or the BCTs
   information on where and when to perform the behaviour and information
   on consequences of behaviour to the individual may be less effective.
   Meta-regression revealed that neither the number of BCTs nor
   self-regulatory BCTs significantly related to effect size. Feedback
   appears to be a potentially effective candidate BCT for future
   interventions promoting long-term PA. Considering concurrence of
   intervention features alongside moderator analyses is important.},

Title = {Evaluating the QUIT-PRIMO clinical practice ePortal to increase smoker
   engagement with online cessation interventions: a national hybrid type 2
   implementation study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Background: Effective web-assisted tobacco interventions (WATIs) have
   been underutilized by smokers; moreover, despite practice guideline
   recommendations, clinical teams do not routinely refer smokers to WATIs.
   Our goal was to test a clinical practice innovation, an ePortal designed
   to change practice and patient behavior. Our hypotheses were that the
   integrated system would result in increased smoker referrals, with an
   automated follow-up system resulting in more smoker registrations and
   finally augmentations of the WATI would result in more smokers quitting
   at 6 months.
   Methods: Practice ePortal Implementation Trial: Practices (n = 174) were
   randomized to an online practice ePortal with an ``e-referral tool{''}
   to the WATI (e-referred smokers received automated email reminders from
   the practice) and with practice feedback reports with patient tracking
   and practice-to-patient secure messaging versus comparison (a paper
   ``referral prescription{''}). Implementation success was measured by the
   number of smokers referred and smokers registering.
   Clinical Effectiveness Trial: To estimate the effectiveness of the WATI
   components on 6-month smoking cessation, registered smokers were
   randomized into three groups: a state-of-the-art tailored WATI control
   {[}control], the WATI enhanced with proactive, pushed tailored email
   motivational messaging (messaging), and the WATI with messaging further
   enhanced with personal secure messaging with a tobacco treatment
   specialist and an online support group (personalized).
   Results: Practice ePortal Trial results: A total of 4789 smokers were
   referred. The mean smokers referred per practice was not statistically
   different by group (ePortal 24.89 (SD 22.29) versus comparison 30.15 (SD
   25.45), p = 0.15). The e-referral portal implementation program resulted
   in nearly triple the rate of smoker registration (31 \% of all smokers
   referred registered online) versus comparison (11 \%, p < 0.001).
   Clinical Effectiveness Trial results: Active smokers randomized to the
   personalized group had a 6-month cessation rate of 25.2 \%, compared
   with the messaging group (26.7 \%) and the control (17 \%). Next, when
   using an inverse probability weighted selection model to account for
   attrition, those randomized to the two groups that received motivational
   messaging (messaging or personalized) were more likely to quit than
   those in the control (p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: Among all smokers referred, the e-referral resulted in
   nearly threefold greater registrants (31 \%) than paper (11 \%). The
   practice ePortal smokers received multiple reminders (increasing
   registration opportunities), and the practices could track patient
   progress. The result was more smokers registering and, thus, more
   cessation opportunities. Combining the proactive referral and the WATI
   resulted in higher rates of smoking cessation.},

   usual care (n=128) to a spouse-assisted lifestyle change intervention
   (n=127) comprising nine monthly goal setting telephone calls to
   participants and support planning calls to spouses over 11months.
   Structural equation modeling was used to examine if the intervention
   influenced the putative mediators of participant self-efficacy and
   perceived spousal support at 6months (i.e. action test); if changes in
   putative mediators at 6months were associated with changes in diet and
   physical activity outcomes at 11months (i.e. conceptual test); and if
   treatment condition effects on outcomes at 11months were mediated by its
   effects on the 6-month putative mediators (i.e. indirect effects test).
   Participants were 94.9\% male, 64.9\% white and were 61.3years old on
   average. The action test showed that the intervention increased dietary
   self-efficacy (p<.001) and perceived spousal support for diet (p<.001)
   and physical activity (p<.01) at 6months. The conceptual test showed
   that increases in participant physical activity self-efficacy at 6months
   were associated with increases in physical activity frequency (p=.01)
   and duration (p=.04) at 11months; other putative mediators were not
   associated with changes in outcomes at 11months. The indirect effects
   tests did not support a mediating role for self-efficacy or perceived
   spousal support. Intervention-induced changes in spousal support and
   dietary self-efficacy did not translate into behavior change. Other
   mechanisms may be driving behavior change.},

Abstract = {Objective: Given the critical role of behavior in preventing and
   treating chronic diseases, it is important to accelerate the development
   of behavioral treatments that can improve chronic disease prevention and
   outcomes. Findings from basic behavioral and social sciences research
   hold great promise for addressing behaviorally based clinical health
   problems, yet there is currently no established pathway for translating
   fundamental behavioral science discoveries into health-related
   treatments ready for Phase III efficacy testing. This article provides a
   systematic framework for developing behavioral treatments for preventing
   and treating chronic diseases. Method: The Obesity-Related Behavioral
   Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model for behavioral treatment development
   features a flexible and progressive process, prespecified clinically
   significant milestones for forward movement, and return to earlier
   stages for refinement and optimization. Results: This article presents
   the background and rationale for the ORBIT model, a summary of key
   questions for each phase, a selection of study designs and methodologies
   well-suited to answering these questions, and prespecified milestones
   for forward or backward movement across phases. Conclusions: The ORBIT
   model provides a progressive, clinically relevant approach to increasing
   the number of evidence-based behavioral treatments available to prevent
   and treat chronic diseases.},

Title = {Using realist review to inform intervention development: methodological
   illustration and conceptual platform for collaborative care in offender
   mental health},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Background: This paper reports how we used a realist review, as part of
   a wider project to improve collaborative mental health care for
   prisoners with common mental health problems, to develop a conceptual
   platform. The importance of offenders gaining support for their mental
   health, and the need for practitioners across the health service, the
   criminal justice system, and the third sector to work together to
   achieve this is recognised internationally. However, the literature does
   not provide coherent analyses of how these ambitions can be achieved.
   This paper demonstrates how a realist review can be applied to inform
   complex intervention development that spans different locations,
   organisations, professions, and care sectors.
   Methods: We applied and developed a realist review for the purposes of
   intervention development, using a three-stage process. (1) An iterative
   database search strategy (extending beyond criminal justice and offender
   health) and groups of academics, practitioners, and people with lived
   experience were used to identify explanatory accounts (n = 347). (2)
   From these accounts, we developed consolidated explanatory accounts (n =
   75). (3) The identified interactions between practitioners and offenders
   (within their organisational, social, and cultural contexts) were
   specified in a conceptual platform. We also specify, step by step, how
   these explanatory accounts were documented, consolidated, and built into
   a conceptual platform. This addresses an important methodological gap
   for social scientists and intervention developers about how to develop
   and articulate programme and implementation theory underpinning complex
   interventions.
   Results: An integrated person-centred system is proposed to improve
   collaborative mental health care for offenders with common mental health
   problems (near to and after release) by achieving consistency between
   the goals of different sectors and practitioners, enabling practitioners
   to apply scientific and experiential knowledge in working judiciously
   and reflectively, and building systems and aligning resources that are
   centred on offenders' health and social care needs.
   Conclusions: As part of a broader programme of work, a realist review
   can make an important contribution to the specification of theoretically
   informed interventions that have the potential to improve health
   outcomes. Our conceptual platform has potential application in related
   systems of health and social care where integrated, and person-centred
   care is a goal.},

Title = {Narrative review of models and success factors for scaling up public
   health interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {Background: To maximise the impact of public health research, research
   interventions found to be effective in improving health need to be
   scaled up and delivered on a population-wide basis. Theoretical
   frameworks and approaches are useful for describing and understanding
   how effective interventions are scaled up from small trials into broader
   policy and practice and can be used as a tool to facilitate effective
   scale-up. The purpose of this literature review was to synthesise
   evidence on scaling up public health interventions into population-wide
   policy and practice, with a focus on the defining and describing
   frameworks, processes and methods of scaling up public health
   initiatives.
   Methods: The review involved keyword searches of electronic databases
   including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EBM Reviews and Google Scholar
   between August and December 2013. Keywords included `scaling up' and
   `scalability', while the search terms `intervention research',
   `translational research', `research dissemination', `health promotion'
   and `public health' were used to focus the search on public health
   approaches. Studies included in the review were published in English
   from January 1990 to December 2013 and described processes, theories or
   frameworks associated with scaling up public health and health promotion
   interventions.
   Results: There is a growing body of literature describing frameworks for
   scaling health interventions, with the review identifying eight
   frameworks, the majority of which have an explicit focus on scaling up
   health action in low and middle income country contexts. Key success
   factors for scaling up included the importance of establishing
   monitoring and evaluation systems, costing and economic modelling of
   intervention approaches, active engagement of a range of implementers
   and the target community, tailoring the scaled-up approach to the local
   context, the use of participatory approaches, the systematic use of
   evidence, infrastructure to support implementation, strong leadership
   and champions, political will, well defined scale-up strategy and strong
   advocacy.
   Conclusions: Effective scaling up requires the systematic use of
   evidence, and it is essential that data from implementation monitoring
   is linked to decision making throughout the scaling up process.
   Conceptual frameworks can assist both policy makers and researchers to
   determine the type of research that is most useful at different stages
   of scaling up processes.},

Abstract = {Interventions to change health-related behaviours typically have modest
   effects and may be more effective if grounded in appropriate theory.
   Most theories applied to public health interventions tend to emphasise
   individual capabilities and motivation, with limited reference to
   context and social factors. Intervention effectiveness may be increased
   by drawing on a wider range of theories incorporating social, cultural
   and economic factors that influence behaviour. The primary aim of this
   paper is to identify theories of behaviour and behaviour change of
   potential relevance to public health interventions across four
   scientific disciplines: psychology, sociology, anthropology and
   economics. We report in detail the methodology of our scoping review
   used to identify these theories including which involved a systematic
   search of electronic databases, consultation with a multidisciplinary
   advisory group, web searching, searching of reference lists and hand
   searching of key behavioural science journals. Of secondary interest we
   developed a list of agreed criteria for judging the quality of the
   theories. We identified 82 theories and 9 criteria for assessing theory
   quality. The potential relevance of this wide-ranging number of theories
   to public health interventions and the ease and usefulness of evaluating
   the theories in terms of the quality criteria are however yet to be
   determined.},

Abstract = {Objective: Reporting guidelines call for descriptions of control group
   support in equal detail as for interventions. However, how to assess the
   active content (behaviour change techniques (BCTs)) of
   treatment-as-usual (TAU) delivered to control groups in trials remains
   unclear. The objective of this study is to pre-test a method of
   assessing TAU in a multicentre cost-effectiveness trial of an
   HIV-treatment adherence intervention.
   Design: HIV-nurses (N=21) completed a semi-structured open-ended
   questionnaire enquiring about TAU adherence counselling. Two coders
   independently coded BCTs.
   Main outcome measures: Completeness and clarity of nurse responses,
   inter-coder reliabilities and the type of BCTs reported were examined.
   Results: The clarity and completeness of nurse responses were adequate.
   Twenty-three of the 26 identified BCTs could be reliably coded (mean
   kappa=.79; mean agreement rate=96\%) and three BCTs scored below
   kappa=.60. Total number of BCTs reported per nurse ranged between 7 and
   19 (M=13.86, SD=3.35).
   Conclusions: This study suggests that the TAU open-ended questionnaire
   is a feasible and reliable tool to capture active content of support
   provided to control participants in a multicentre adherence intervention
   trial. Considerable variability in the number of BCTs provided to
   control patients was observed, illustrating the importance of reliably
   collecting and accurately reporting control group support.},

Title = {What strategies are used to build practitioners' capacity to implement
   community-based interventions and are they effective?: a systematic
   review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {Background: Numerous agencies are providing training, technical
   assistance, and other support to build community-based practitioners'
   capacity to adopt and implement evidence-based prevention interventions.
   Yet, little is known about how best to design capacity-building
   interventions to optimize their effectiveness. Wandersman et al. (Am J
   Community Psychol. 50: 445-59, 2102) proposed the Evidence-Based System
   of Innovation Support (EBSIS) as a framework to guide research and
   thereby strengthen the evidence base for building practitioners'
   capacity. The purpose of this review was to contribute to further
   development of the EBSIS by systematically reviewing empirical studies
   of capacity-building interventions to identify (1) the range of
   strategies used, (2) variations in the way they were structured, and (3)
   evidence for their effectiveness at increasing practitioners' capacity
   to use evidence-based prevention interventions.
   Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched for English-language
   articles reporting findings of empirical studies of capacity-building
   interventions that were published between January 2000 and January 2014
   and were intended to increase use of evidence-based prevention
   interventions in non-clinical settings. To maximize review data, studies
   were not excluded a priori based on design or methodological quality.
   Using the EBSIS as a guide, two researchers independently extracted data
   from included studies. Vote counting and meta-summary methods were used
   to summarize findings.
   Results: The review included 42 publications reporting findings from 29
   studies. In addition to confirming the strategies and structures
   described in the EBSIS, the review identified two new strategies and two
   variations in structure. Capacity-building interventions were found to
   be effective at increasing practitioners' adoption (n = 10 of 12
   studies) and implementation (n = 9 of 10 studies) of evidence-based
   interventions. Findings were mixed for interventions' effects on
   practitioners' capacity or intervention planning behaviors. Both the
   type and structure of capacity-building strategies may have influenced
   effectiveness. The review also identified contextual factors that may
   require variations in the ways capacity-building interventions are
   designed.
   Conclusions: Based on review findings, refinements are suggested to the
   EBSIS. The refined framework moves the field towards a more
   comprehensive and standardized approach to conceptualizing the types and
   structures of capacity-building strategies. This standardization will
   assist with synthesizing findings across studies and guide
   capacity-building practice and research.},

Title = {A cluster randomized Hybrid Type III trial testing an implementation
   support strategy to facilitate the use of an evidence-based practice in
   VA homeless programs},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: The Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs
   Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program is one of the largest initiatives
   to end Veteran homelessness. However, mental health and substance use
   disorders continue to reduce client stability and impede program
   success. HUD-VASH programs do not consistently employ evidence-based
   practices that address co-occurring mental health and substance use
   disorders. This paper presents a study protocol to evaluate the
   implementation of an evidence-based, co-occurring disorder treatment
   called Maintaining Independence and Sobriety Through Systems
   Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Veterans Edition (MISSION-Vet) in
   HUD-VASH using an implementation strategy called Getting To Outcomes
   (GTO).
   Methods/design: In three large VA Medical Centers, this Hybrid Type III
   trial will randomize case managers and their clients by HUD-VASH
   sub-teams to receive either MISSION-Vet Implementation as Usual
   (IU-standard training and access to the MISSION-Vet treatment manuals)
   or MISSION-Vet implementation augmented by GTO. In addition to testing
   GTO, effectiveness of the treatment (MISSION-Vet) will be assessed using
   existing Veteran-level data from the HUD-VASH data monitoring system.
   This project will compare GTO and IU case managers and their clients on
   the following variables: (1) fidelity to the MISSION-Vet intervention;
   (2) proportion of time the Veteran is housed; (3) mental health,
   substance use, and functional outcomes among Veterans; and (4) factors
   key to the successful deployment of a new treatment as specified by the
   Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM)
   model.
   Discussion: This project is an important step for developing an
   implementation strategy to increase adoption of evidence-based practice
   use in VA homeless programs, and to further examine efficacy of
   MISSION-Vet in HUD-VASH. This project has important implications for
   program managers, policy makers, and researchers within the homelessness
   field. VA Central IRB approval for this study was granted in October
   2011. The three sites were trained on MISSION-Vet and GTO in the first
   half of 2013. The first GTO planning meetings began after training
   occurred, between January 2013 and November 2013, across the three
   sites. The data collection-via a fidelity measure embedded into the VA
   Computerized Patient Record System-began as each site initiated
   MISSION-Vet, between April 2013 and January 2014.},

Abstract = {A sequential intervention to facilitate the adoption and maintenance of
   dental flossing was conducted among 205 students in India, aged
   18-26years. Two experimental groups received different treatment
   sequences and were observed at three assessment points, 34days apart.
   One group received first a motivational intervention (intention, outcome
   expectancies, and risk perception, followed by a self-regulatory
   intervention (planning, self-efficacy, and action control). The second
   group received the same intervention in the opposite order. Both
   intervention sequences yielded gains in terms of flossing, planning,
   self-efficacy, and action control. However, at Time 2, those who had
   received the self-regulatory intervention first, were superior to their
   counterparts who had received the motivational intervention first. At
   Time 3, differences vanished as everyone had then received both
   interventions. Thus, findings highlight the benefits of a
   self-regulatory compared to a mere motivational intervention.},

Title = {I-RREACH: an engagement and assessment tool for improving implementation
   readiness of researchers, organizations and communities in complex
   interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Background: Non-communicable chronic diseases are the leading causes of
   mortality globally, and nearly 80\% of these deaths occur in low-and
   middle-income countries (LMICs). In high-income countries (HICs),
   inequitable distribution of resources affects poorer and otherwise
   disadvantaged groups including Aboriginal peoples. Cardiovascular
   mortality in high-income countries has recently begun to fall; however,
   these improvements are not realized among citizens in LMICs or those
   subgroups in high-income countries who are disadvantaged in the social
   determinants of health including Aboriginal people. It is critical to
   develop multi-faceted, affordable and realistic health interventions in
   collaboration with groups who experience health inequalities. Based on
   community-based participatory research (CBPR), we aimed to develop
   implementation tools to guide complex interventions to ensure that
   health gains can be realized in low-resource environments.
   Methods: We developed the I-RREACH (Intervention and Research Readiness
   Engagement and Assessment of Community Health Care) tool to guide
   implementation of interventions in low-resource environments. We
   employed CBPR and a consensus methodology to (1) develop the theoretical
   basis of the tool and (2) to identify key implementation factor domains;
   then, we (3) collected participant evaluation data to validate the tool
   during implementation.
   Results: The I-RREACH tool was successfully developed using a
   community-based consensus method and is rooted in participatory
   principles, equalizing the importance of the knowledge and perspectives
   of researchers and community stakeholders while encouraging respectful
   dialogue. The I-RREACH tool consists of three phases: fact finding,
   stakeholder dialogue and community member/patient dialogue. The
   evaluation for our first implementation of I-RREACH by participants was
   overwhelmingly positive, with 95\% or more of participants indicating
   comfort with and support for the process and the dialogue it creates.
   Conclusions: The I-RREACH tool was designed to (1) pinpoint key domains
   required for dialogue between the community and the research team to
   facilitate implementation of complex health interventions and research
   projects and (2) to identify existing strengths and areas requiring
   further development for effective implementation. I-RREACH has been
   found to be easily adaptable to diverse geographical and cultural
   settings and can be further adapted to other complex interventions.
   Further research should include the potential use of the I-RREACH tool
   in the development of blue prints for scale-up of successful
   interventions, particularly in low-resource environments.},

Title = {Using Qualitative Methods Within a Mixed-Methods Approach to Developing

Abstract = {Objective: This article illustrates how qualitative methods can be used
   in the development and evaluation of behavior change interventions.
   Although many campaigns advise young people to drink responsibly, few
   clarify how to convert this general advice into specific behavioral
   strategies. Resilience-based approaches argue that treating young
   non-drinkers and moderate drinkers as ``experts{''} in responsible
   alcohol use may facilitate co-creation of acceptable interventions that
   focus on how to change behavior. Method: Four distinct phases of
   intervention development were linked to past research and future
   developments. Results: First, analysis of correlates of alcohol use
   using data from a survey of 1,412 people aged 16-21 indicated that
   alcohol harm-reduction interventions should help young people to develop
   skills and strategies to resist alcohol. Second, interpretative
   phenomenological analysis of 25 interviews with people purposively
   selected from among the survey sample identified general strategies and
   specific tactics used by young people to manage opportunities to drink.
   Third, insights from the first 2 phases and past qualitative research
   guided development of video resources to be use in school-based alcohol
   education to illustrate strategies and tactics for moderate or non-use
   of alcohol. Fourth, 18 focus groups with students and teachers were used
   to evaluate the video: structured thematic analysis indicated that after
   revision the video would be a valuable addition to school-based alcohol
   education. Conclusions: Findings from the 4 phases highlight the value
   of using different qualitative and quantitative methods as part of a
   program of work designed to inform the development, refinement, and
   evaluation of health psychology interventions.},

Title = {Development of a behaviour change intervention to increase upper limb
   exercise in stroke rehabilitation},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {Background: Two thirds of survivors will achieve independent ambulation
   after a stroke, but less than half will recover upper limb function.
   There is strong evidence to support intensive repetitive task-oriented
   training for recovery after stroke. The number of repetitions needed is
   suggested to be in the order of hundreds, but this is not currently
   being achieved in clinical practice. In an effort to bridge this
   evidence-practice gap, we have developed a behaviour change intervention
   that aims to increase provision of upper limb repetitive task-oriented
   training in stroke rehabilitation. This paper aims to describe the
   systematic processes that took place in collaboratively developing the
   behaviour change intervention.
   Methods: The methods used in this study were not defined a priori but
   were guided by the Behaviour Change Wheel. The process was collaborative
   and iterative with four stages of development emerging (i) establishing
   an intervention development group; (ii) structured discussions to
   understand the problem, prioritise target behaviours and analyse target
   behaviours; (iii) collaborative design of theoretically underpinned
   intervention components and (iv) piloting and refining of intervention
   components.
   Results: The intervention development group consisted of the research
   team and stroke therapy team at a local stroke rehabilitation unit. The
   group prioritised four target behaviours at the therapist level: (i)
   identifying suitable patients for exercises, (ii) provision of
   exercises, (iii) communicating exercises to family/visitors and (iv)
   monitoring and reviewing exercises. It also provides a method for
   self-monitoring performance in order to measure fidelity. The developed
   intervention, PRACTISE (Promoting Recovery of the Arm: Clinical Tools
   for Intensive Stroke Exercise), consists of team meetings and the
   PRACTISE Toolkit (screening tool and upper limb exercise plan, PRACTISE
   exercise pack and an audit tool).
   Conclusions: This paper provides an example of how the Behaviour Change
   Wheel may be applied in the collaborative development of a behaviour
   change intervention for health professionals. The process involved was
   resource-intensive, and the iterative process was difficult to capture.
   The use of a published behaviour change framework and taxonomy will
   assist replication in future research and clinical use. The feasibility
   and acceptability of PRACTISE is currently being explored in two other
   stroke rehabilitation units.},

Title = {Effectiveness of a tailored implementation programme to improve
   recognition, diagnosis and treatment of anxiety and depression in
   general practice: a cluster randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {Background: Anxiety and depression are not always diagnosed and treated
   in primary care as has been recommended. A tailored implementation
   programme, which addresses key barriers for change by targeted
   interventions, may help to remedy this.
   Methods: The effectiveness of an individually tailored implementation
   programme, additional to standardised training and feedback on the
   recognition and treatment of patients with anxiety or depression in
   general practice, was examined in a cluster randomised controlled trial.
   Participants were 46 general practitioners (GPs) from 23 general
   practices (12 intervention, 11 control) and 444 patients aged 18 years
   or older (198 intervention, 246 control) who screened positive on the
   extended Kessler 10. In the control group, GPs received a 1-day training
   in guidelines for recognition and stepped treatment for anxiety and
   depression. Ten months after the training session, GPs received feedback
   on their performance over the preceding 6 months. In the intervention
   group, GPs received the same training and feedback as those in the
   control condition; in addition, they were offered support, tailored to
   perceived local barriers to change. The support was delivered in the
   format of peer group supervisions and personalised telephone
   consultations. Data were based on an audit of patient records and
   patient surveys at baseline and after 3 and 6 months.
   Results: The tailored implementation programme led to recognition of a
   higher proportion of patients presenting with anxiety and depression
   (42\% versus 31\%; odds ratio (OR) = 1.60; 95\% CI: 1.01-2.53), more
   consultations after recognition (IRR = 1.78; 95\% CI: 1.14-2.78) and did
   not lead to more prescription of antidepressants (OR = 1.07; 95\% CI:
   0.52-2.19) or referral to specialist mental health services (OR = 1.62;
   95\% CI: 0.72-3.64). Patients in the intervention group reported better
   accessibility of care (effect size (ES) = 0.4; p < 0.05) and provision
   of information and advice (ES = 0.5; p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: A tailored implementation programme may enhance the
   recognition and treatment of patients with anxiety or depression.
   Further development and evaluation of the programme is warranted to
   determine its cost-effectiveness.},

Title = {A refined compilation of implementation strategies: results from the
   Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) project},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Background: Identifying, developing, and testing implementation
   strategies are important goals of implementation science. However, these
   efforts have been complicated by the use of inconsistent language and
   inadequate descriptions of implementation strategies in the literature.
   The Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) study aimed to
   refine a published compilation of implementation strategy terms and
   definitions by systematically gathering input from a wide range of
   stakeholders with expertise in implementation science and clinical
   practice.
   Methods: Purposive sampling was used to recruit a panel of experts in
   implementation and clinical practice who engaged in three rounds of a
   modified Delphi process to generate consensus on implementation
   strategies and definitions. The first and second rounds involved
   Web-based surveys soliciting comments on implementation strategy terms
   and definitions. After each round, iterative refinements were made based
   upon participant feedback. The third round involved a live polling and
   consensus process via a Web-based platform and conference call.
   Results: Participants identified substantial concerns with 31\% of the
   terms and/or definitions and suggested five additional strategies.
   Seventy-five percent of definitions from the originally published
   compilation of strategies were retained after voting. Ultimately, the
   expert panel reached consensus on a final compilation of 73
   implementation strategies.
   Conclusions: This research advances the field by improving the
   conceptual clarity, relevance, and comprehensiveness of implementation
   strategies that can be used in isolation or combination in
   implementation research and practice. Future phases of ERIC will focus
   on developing conceptually distinct categories of strategies as well as
   ratings for each strategy's importance and feasibility. Next, the expert
   panel will recommend multifaceted strategies for hypothetical yet
   real-world scenarios that vary by sites' endorsement of evidence-based
   programs and practices and the strength of contextual supports that
   surround the effort.},

Abstract = {The increasing prevalence of childhood overweight makes children an
   important target for health promotion programmes. An intervention was
   designed for mothers to provide more vegetables to their daughters'
   diet. A randomized controlled trial compared a self-regulation condition
   with a control condition in 155 mothers aged 25-50 years. Dependent
   variable was children's (aged 6-11 years) vegetable consumption which
   was reported by their mothers at three points in time. After baseline
   (Time 1), the intervention group received theory-based instructional
   leaflets to promote self-regulatory skills for providing a healthy
   nutrition for children. Changes were assessed after two weeks (Time 2)
   and at three-month follow-up (Time 3). The self-regulation intervention
   in mothers led to an increase in vegetable intake among their daughters
   at Time 2 but not at Time 3. However, maintenance of vegetable
   consumption at Time 3 was mediated by the amount of vegetable intake at
   Time 2. Engaging mothers in self-regulatory health promotion programmes
   may be a feasible strategy to facilitate more vegetable intake among
   their daughters.},

Title = {Early identification and intervention services for children with autism
   in Vietnam},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   In high income countries in Europe and North America, early
   identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have
   been linked to improved long-term outcomes. However, in most low and
   middle income countries (LMIC) little is known about the use or
   availability of such services, which limits the ability of policy and
   development planning. The purpose of the present study was to assess the
   use of ASD services in a number of cities in Vietnam, an Asian LMIC, in
   order to identify areas within the field that should be specifically
   targeted to improve ASD services in Vietnam.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   Surveys were conducted in six different cities across Vietnam with 90
   parents/caregivers of children with ASD, 115 professionals working with
   children with ASD, and 10 directors of agencies providing ASD services.
   The parents/caregivers' survey assessed demographics and information
   regarding their child's symptoms and services the child received. The
   professionals' survey assessed their demographic and professional
   background, the ASD services they provide, and their perspective on the
   quality of ASD services at their agency. The directors' survey included
   these same questions as well as additional questions regarding the
   operation of the agency.
   RESULTS
   Early identification and intervention ASD services are available in
   Vietnam, at least in major cities. However, there is a lack of
   well-trained professionals, the tools used for evaluation and diagnosis
   are limited, outdated and unstandardized, and the quality of services is
   questionable. Most importantly, a scientific evidence base for services
   is absent, and the country lacks an official governmental policy for
   supporting children with ASD.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Research directly assessing the quality of ASD services in Vietnam is
   needed. Most importantly, efforts at facilitating governmental policy
   and support advocacy are needed to increase the likelihood that families
   and children with ASD will receive appropriate and effective services.},

Abstract = {There is a need to consolidate the evidence base underlying our toolbox
   of methods of behaviour change. Recent efforts to this effect have
   conducted meta-regressions on evaluations of behaviour change
   interventions, deriving each method's effectiveness from its association
   to intervention effect size. However, there are a range of issues that
   raise concern about whether this approach is actually furthering or
   instead obstructing the advancement of health psychology theories and
   the quality of health behaviour change interventions. Using examples
   from theory, the literature and data from previous meta-analyses, these
   concerns and their implications are explained and illustrated. An
   iterative protocol for evidence base accumulation is proposed that
   integrates evidence derived from both experimental and applied behaviour
   change research, and combines theory development in experimental
   settings with theory testing in applied real-life settings. As evidence
   gathered in this manner accumulates, a cumulative science of behaviour
   change can develop.},

Title = {A study to examine the uses of personal strength in relation to mental
   health recovery in adults with serious mental illnesses: a research

Abstract = {This study will explore the relationships among strengths self-efficacy,
   resourcefulness, stigma experience and mental health recovery in
   community-dwelling adults with serious mental illnesses. Mental health
   practices have focued on psychopathphysiology. Stigma heavily plagued
   clients with mental illnesses and is one of the greatest barriers to
   mental health recovery. Personal strengths like strengths self-efficacy,
   people's confidence in using their personal strengths, and
   resourcefulness, the ability to carry out daily activities, have been
   linked to positive mental health. However, the linkage between strengths
   self-efficacy, resourcefulness and mental health recovery remains
   uncharted. A cross-sectional, descriptive, mixed methods study will be
   conducted. A funded study by the Sigma Theta Tau, Upsilon Eta Chapter,
   August 2013, involving a convenience sample of 100 participants is
   planned. Included are community dwelling adults between 21 to 65 years
   old having been diagnosed with serious mental illnesses. Clients with
   current co-occurring substance abuse will be excluded. Participants
   complete questionnaires and undergo an interview. Correlations among the
   study variables will be examined. Regression analysis will determine if
   recovery can be predicted by strengths self-efficacy, resourcefulness
   and stigma experience. Interview data will be transcribed and analyzed
   by thematic analysis. This study will look beyond clients' disability to
   focus on their recovery and healing capacities such as strengths
   self-efficacy and resourcefulness. Findings will expand our knowledge
   about mental health recovery. Knowledge gained from this study may pave
   the way for future nursing strategies to aid recovery and inform the
   development of positive, strengths-based interventions.},

Title = {Enhancing outreach for persons with serious mental illness: 12-month
   results from a cluster randomized trial of an adaptive implementation
   strategy},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Background: Few implementation strategies have been empirically tested
   for their effectiveness in improving uptake of evidence-based treatments
   or programs. This study compared the effectiveness of an immediate
   versus delayed enhanced implementation strategy (Enhanced Replicating
   Effective Programs (REP)) for providers at Veterans Health
   Administration (VA) outpatient facilities (sites) on improved uptake of
   an outreach program (Re-Engage) among sites not initially responding to
   a standard implementation strategy.
   Methods: One mental health provider from each U.S. VA site (N = 158) was
   initially given a REP-based package and training program in Re-Engage.
   The Re-Engage program involved giving each site provider a list of
   patients with serious mental illness who had not been seen at their
   facility for at least a year, requesting that providers contact these
   patients, assessing patient clinical status, and where appropriate,
   facilitating appointments to VA health services. At month 6, sites
   considered non-responsive (N = 89, total of 3,075 patients), defined as
   providers updating documentation for less than <80\% of patients on
   their list, were randomized to two adaptive implementation
   interventions: Enhanced REP (provider coaching; N = 40 sites) for 6
   months followed by Standard REP for 6 months; versus continued Standard
   REP (N = 49 sites) for 6 months followed by 6 months of Enhanced REP for
   sites still not responding. Outcomes included patient-level Re-Engage
   implementation and utilization.
   Results: Patients from sites that were randomized to receive Enhanced
   REP immediately compared to Standard REP were more likely to have a
   completed contact (adjusted OR = 2.13; 95\% CI: 1.09-4.19, P = 0.02).
   There were no differences in patient-level utilization between Enhanced
   and Standard REP sites.
   Conclusions: Enhanced REP was associated with greater Re-Engage program
   uptake (completed contacts) among sites not responding to a standard
   implementation strategy. Further research is needed to determine whether
   national implementation of Facilitation results in tangible changes in
   patient-level outcomes.},

Title = {Using realist evaluation to open the black box of knowledge translation:
   a state-of-the-art review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Background: In knowledge translation, complex interventions may be
   implemented in the attempt to improve uptake of research-based knowledge
   in practice. Traditional evaluation efforts that focus on aggregate
   effectiveness represent an oversimplification of both the environment
   and the interventions themselves. However, theory-based approaches to
   evaluation, such as realist evaluation (RE), may be better-suited to
   examination of complex knowledge translation interventions with a view
   to understanding what works, for whom, and under what conditions. It is
   the aim of the present state-of-the-art review to examine current
   literature with regard to the use of RE in the assessment of knowledge
   translation interventions implemented within healthcare environments.
   Methods: Multiple online databases were searched from 1997 through June
   2013. Primary studies examining the application or implementation of
   knowledge translation interventions within healthcare settings and using
   RE were selected for inclusion. Varying applications of RE across
   studies were examined in terms of a) reporting of core elements of RE,
   and b) potential feasibility of this evaluation method.
   Results: A total of 14 studies (6 study protocols), published between
   2007 and 2013, were identified for inclusion. Projects were initiated in
   a variety of healthcare settings and represented a range of
   interventions. While a majority of authors mentioned context (C),
   mechanism (M) and outcome (O), a minority reported the development of
   C-M-O configurations or testable hypotheses based on these
   configurations. Four completed studies reported results that included
   refinement of proposed C-M-O configurations and offered explanations
   within the RE framework. In the few studies offering insight regarding
   challenges associated with the use of RE, difficulties were expressed
   regarding the definition of both mechanisms and contextual factors.
   Overall, RE was perceived as time-consuming and resource intensive.
   Conclusions: The use of RE in knowledge translation is relatively new;
   however, theory-building approaches to the examination of complex
   interventions in this area may be increasing as researchers attempt to
   identify what works, for whom and under what circumstances. Completion
   of the RE cycle may be challenging, particularly in the development of
   C-M-O configurations; however, as researchers approach challenges and
   explore innovations in its application, rich and detailed accounts may
   improve feasibility.},

Title = {Implementing an outreaching, preference-led stepped care intervention
   programme to reduce late life depressive symptoms: results of a
   mixed-methods study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Background: Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in old age, but
   they remain mostly untreated. Several clinical trials have shown
   promising results in preventing or reducing depressive symptoms.
   However, it is not clear how robust these effects are in the real world
   of day-to-day care. Therefore, we have implemented the `Lust for Life'
   programme, which significantly reduced depressive symptoms in
   community-dwelling older adults in the first three months after
   implementation. This mixed-methods study was conducted alongside the
   trial to develop a contextualised understanding of factors affecting the
   implementation.
   Methods: A total of 263 persons of 65 years and older with depressive
   symptoms were recruited from 18 general practices and home care
   organizations in the Netherlands. We used qualitative data (in-depth
   interviews and focus group discussions with participants with depressive
   symptoms and healthcare professionals) as well as quantitative data
   (longitudinal data on the severity of depressive symptoms) to explore
   hindering and facilitating factors to the implementation of the `Lust
   for Life' programme.
   Results: The uptake of the routine screening was poor and imposed
   significant burdens on participants and healthcare professionals, and
   drop-out rates were high. Participants' perceived mental problems and
   need for care played a key role in their decision to participate in the
   programme and to step up to consequent interventions. Older people
   preferred interventions that focused on interpersonal contact. The
   programme was only effective when delivered by mental healthcare nurses,
   compared to home care nurses with limited experience in providing mental
   healthcare.
   Conclusions: The intervention programme was effective in reducing
   depressive symptoms, and valuable lessons can be learned from this
   implementation trial. Given the low uptake and high investment, we
   advise against routine screening for depressive symptoms in general
   healthcare. Further, agreement between the participant and healthcare
   professional on perceived need for care and intervention is vital.
   Rather than providing a stepped care intervention programme, we showed
   that offering only one single preference-led intervention is effective.
   Lastly, since the provision of the interventions seems to ask for
   specific skills and experiences, it might require mental healthcare
   nurses to offer the programme.},

Title = {GRAIDs: a framework for closing the gap in the availability of health
   promotion programs and interventions for people with disabilities},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {Background: Evidence-based health promotion programs developed and
   tested in the general population typically exclude people with
   disabilities. To address this gap, a set of methods and criteria were
   created to adapt evidence-based health promotion programs for people
   with disabilities. In this first study, we describe a framework for
   adapting evidence-based obesity prevention strategies for people with
   disabilities. We illustrate how the framework has been used to adapt the
   U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) obesity
   prevention strategies for individuals with physical and developmental
   disabilities.
   Methods: The development of inclusion guidelines, recommendations and
   adaptations for obesity prevention (referred to as GRAIDs - Guidelines,
   Recommendations, Adaptations Including Disability) consists of five
   components: (i) a scoping review of the published and grey literature;
   (ii) an expert workgroup composed of nationally recognized leaders in
   disability and health promotion who review, discuss and modify the
   scoping review materials and develop the content into draft GRAIDs;
   (iii) focus groups with individuals with disabilities and their family
   members (conducted separately) who provide input on the potential
   applicability of the proposed GRAIDs in real world settings; (iv) a
   national consensus meeting with 21 expert panel members who review and
   vote on a final set of GRAIDs; and (v) an independent peer review of
   GRAIDs by national leaders from key disability organizations and
   professional groups through an online web portal.
   Results: This is an ongoing project, and to date, the process has been
   used to develop 11 GRAIDs to coincide with 11 of the 24 CDC obesity
   prevention strategies.
   Conclusion: A set of methods and criteria have been developed to allow
   researchers, practitioners and government agencies to promote inclusive
   health promotion guidelines, strategies and practices for people with
   disabilities. Evidence-based programs developed for people without
   disabilities can now be adapted for people with disabilities using the
   GRAIDs framework.},

Abstract = {Objective: Child pedestrian injury is a global public health challenge.
   This randomized, controlled trial considered comparative efficacy of
   individualized streetside training, training in a virtual pedestrian
   environment, training using videos and Web sites, plus no-training
   control, to improve children's street-crossing ability. Methods:
   Pedestrian safety was evaluated among 231 7- and 8-year-olds using both
   streetside (field) and laboratory-based (virtual environment) trials
   before intervention group assignment, immediately posttraining, and 6
   months posttraining. All training groups received 6 30-min sessions.
   Four outcomes assessed pedestrian safety: start delay (temporal lag
   before initiating crossing), hits/close calls (collisions/near-misses
   with vehicles in simulated crossings), attention to traffic (looks left
   and right, controlled for time), and missed opportunities (safe crossing
   opportunities that were missed). Results: Results showed training in the
   virtual pedestrian environment and especially individualized streetside
   training resulted in safer pedestrian behavior postintervention and at
   follow-up. As examples, children trained streetside entered safe traffic
   gaps more quickly posttraining than control group children and children
   trained streetside or in the virtual environment had somewhat fewer
   hits/close calls in postintervention VR trials. Children showed minimal
   change in attention to traffic posttraining. Children trained with
   videos/websites showed minimal learning. Conclusion: Both individualized
   streetside training and training within virtual pedestrian environments
   may improve 7- and 8-year-olds' street-crossing safety. Individualized
   training has limitations of adult time and labor. Virtual environment
   training has limitations of accessibility and cost. Given the public
   health burden of child pedestrian injuries, future research should
   explore innovative strategies for effective training that can be broadly
   disseminated.},

Title = {Barriers and enablers to delivery of the Healthy Kids Check: an analysis
   informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework and COM-B model},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {Background: More than a fifth of Australian children arrive at school
   developmentally vulnerable. To counteract this, the Healthy Kids Check
   (HKC), a one-off health assessment aimed at preschool children, was
   introduced in 2008 into Australian general practice. Delivery of
   services has, however, remained low. The Theoretical Domains Framework,
   which provides a method to understand behaviours theoretically, can be
   condensed into three core components: capability, opportunity and
   motivation, and the COM-B model. Utilising this system, this study aimed
   to determine the barriers and enablers to delivery of the HKC, to inform
   the design of an intervention to promote provision of HKC services in
   Australian general practice.
   Methods: Data from 6 focus group discussions with 40 practitioners from
   general practices in socio-culturally diverse areas of Melbourne,
   Victoria, were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Many practitioners expressed uncertainty regarding their
   capabilities and the practicalities of delivering HKCs, but in some
   cases HKCs had acted as a catalyst for professional development. Key
   connections between immunisation services and delivery of HKCs prompted
   practices to have systems of recall and reminder in place.
   Standardisation of methods for developmental assessment and streamlined
   referral pathways affected practitioners' confidence and motivation to
   perform HKCs.
   Conclusion: Application of a systematic framework effectively
   demonstrated how a number of behaviours could be targeted to increase

Title = {Coaction in Multiple Behavior Change Interventions: Consistency Across
   Multiple Studies on Weight Management and Obesity Prevention},

Abstract = {Objective: Coaction refers to the extent to which taking action on one
   behavior increases the odds of taking action on a second behavior. This
   integrative study examines the generalization of coaction in three
   studies on weight-related behaviors. Method: Data from three randomized
   trials of tailored interventions (n = 1,277, n = 1,800, and n = 6,000)
   were examined to determine if coaction of behavior change occurred
   differentially in treatment and control groups. In each analysis, the
   likelihood of progressing to the Action or Maintenance stages for the
   target behaviors was evaluated using logistic regression. Results:
   Despite differences in populations, targeted behaviors, levels of
   tailoring in interventions, and timing of follow-up assessments, 17 out
   of 24 (70.8\%) logistic regressions revealed significant coaction in the
   treatment group as opposed to only three out of 24 (12.5\%) in the
   control condition. In 23/24 analyses, coaction of behavior change was
   larger on an absolute basis in the treatment group. Individuals in the
   treatment group progressing to Action/ Maintenance for one behavior were
   1.4-5 times more likely to make progress on another behavior compared to
   those in the treatment group who did not make such progress on the first
   behavior. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that despite considerable
   variability in study design, coaction reliably occurs more in the
   presence of Transtheoretical-Model based multiple behavior change
   interventions. Additional studies are needed to replicate these results
   in other behavioral areas and to examine the predictors of differential
   coaction. The ability to consistently create coaction within multiple
   behavior interventions can increase the efficacy and cost-effectiveness
   of multiple behavior change interventions.},

Abstract = {Objective: To systematically investigate the extent and type of theory
   use in physical activity and dietary interventions, as well as
   associations between extent and type of theory use with intervention
   effectiveness. Methods: An in-depth analysis of studies included in two
   systematic reviews of physical activity and healthy eating interventions
   (k = 190). Extent and type of theory use was assessed using the Theory
   Coding Scheme (TCS) and intervention effectiveness was calculated using
   Hedges's g. Metaregressions assessed the relationships between these
   measures. Results: Fifty-six percent of interventions reported a theory
   base. Of these, 90\% did not report links between all of their behavior
   change techniques (BCTs) with specific theoretical constructs and 91\%
   did not report links between all the specified constructs with BCTs. The
   associations between a composite score or specific items on the TCS and
   intervention effectiveness were inconsistent. Interventions based on
   Social Cognitive Theory or the Transtheoretical Model were similarly
   effective and no more effective than interventions not reporting a
   theory base. Conclusions: The coding of theory in these studies
   suggested that theory was not often used extensively in the development
   of interventions. Moreover, the relationships between type of theory
   used and the extent of theory use with effectiveness were generally
   weak. The findings suggest that attempts to apply the two theories
   commonly used in this review more extensively are unlikely to increase
   intervention effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Research on the usefulness of mindfulness and self-compassion for
   dieting has focused on meditative practices. However, meditation can be
   difficult to maintain, especially while dieting. Thus, the present
   research attempted to induce mindfulness and self-compassion by using
   food diaries that required the participant to either focus on concrete
   (i.e. how they are eating) construals or abstract (i.e. why they are
   eating) construals. The concrete construals were expected to increase
   mindfulness and self-compassion, as well as decrease avoidance and
   negative thoughts (which would further aid the development of
   mindfulness and self-compassion). Study 1 found that mindfulness and
   self-compassion mediated the inverse relationship of avoidance and
   negative thoughts with weight loss. Study 2 showed that concrete
   construal diaries increased mindfulness and self-compassion, decreased
   avoidance and negative thoughts, and supported weight loss significantly
   more than the abstract construal diaries. Study 3, then, compared the
   concrete construal diaries with a mindful self-compassionate meditation
   programme. There was no difference in weight loss at the end of the
   intervention, but at a three-month follow-up, the diaries performed
   better at weight maintenance. Thus, the concrete construal diaries may
   promote mindfulness and self-compassion and potentially promote
   long-term weight loss.},

Title = {Development of a behaviour change intervention: a case study on the
   practical application of theory},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Background: Use of theory in implementation of complex interventions is
   widely recommended. A complex trial intervention, to enhance
   self-management support for people with osteoarthritis (OA) in primary
   care, needed to be implemented in the Managing Osteoarthritis in
   Consultations (MOSAICS) trial. One component of the trial intervention
   was delivery by general practitioners (GPs) of an enhanced consultation
   for patients with OA. The aim of our case study is to describe the
   systematic selection and use of theory to develop a behaviour change
   intervention to implement GP delivery of the enhanced consultation.
   Methods: The development of the behaviour change intervention was guided
   by four theoretical models/frameworks: i) an implementation of change
   model to guide overall approach, ii) the Theoretical Domains Framework
   (TDF) to identify relevant determinants of change, iii) a model for the
   selection of behaviour change techniques to address identified
   determinants of behaviour change, and iv) the principles of adult
   learning. Methods and measures to evaluate impact of the behaviour
   change intervention were identified.
   Results: The behaviour change intervention presented the GPs with a
   well-defined proposal for change; addressed seven of the TDF domains (e.
   g., knowledge, skills, motivation and goals); incorporated ten behaviour
   change techniques (e. g., information provision, skills rehearsal,
   persuasive communication); and was delivered in workshops that valued
   the expertise and professional values of GPs. The workshops used a
   mixture of interactive and didactic sessions, were facilitated by
   opinion leaders, and utilised `context-bound communication skills
   training.' Methods and measures selected to evaluate the behaviour
   change intervention included: appraisal of satisfaction with workshops,
   GP report of intention to practise and an assessment of video-recorded
   consultations of GPs with patients with OA.
   Conclusions: A stepped approach to the development of a behaviour change
   intervention, with the utilisation of theoretical frameworks to identify
   determinants of change matched with behaviour change techniques, has
   enabled a systematic and theory-driven development of an intervention
   designed to enhance consultations by GPs for patients with OA. The
   success of the behaviour change intervention in practice will be
   evaluated in the context of the MOSAICS trial as a whole, and will
   inform understanding of practice level and patient outcomes in the
   trial.},

Title = {Health on Impulse: When Low Self-Control Promotes Healthy Food Choices},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {103-109},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objective: Food choices are often made mindlessly, when individuals are
   not able or willing to exert self-control. Under low self-control,
   individuals have difficulties to resist palatable but unhealthy food
   products. In contrast to previous research aiming to foster healthy
   choices by promoting high self-control, this study exploits situations
   of low self-control, by strategically using the tendency under these
   conditions to rely on heuristics (simple decision rules) as quick guides
   to action. More specifically, the authors associated healthy food
   products with the social proof heuristic (i.e., normative cues that
   convey majority endorsement for those products). Method: One hundred
   seventy-seven students (119 men), with an average age of 20.47 years (SD
   = 2.25) participated in the experiment. This study used a 2 (low vs.
   high self-control) x 2 (social proof vs. no heuristic) x 2 (trade-off
   vs. control choice) design, with the latter as within-subjects factor.
   The dependent variable was the number of healthy food choices in a
   food-choice task. Results: In line with previous studies, people made
   fewer healthy food choices under low self-control. However, this
   negative effect of low self-control on food choice was reversed when the
   healthy option was associated with the social proof heuristic. In that
   case, people made more healthy choices under conditions of low
   self-control. Conclusion: Low self-control may be even more beneficial
   for healthy food choices than high self-control in the presence of a
   heuristic. Exploiting situations of low self-control is a new and
   promising method to promote health on impulse.},

Title = {A cluster randomized trial to evaluate external support for the
   implementation of positive behavioral interventions and supports by
   school personnel},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: Urban schools lag behind non-urban schools in attending to
   the behavioral health needs of their students. This is especially
   evident with regard to the level of use of evidence-based interventions
   with school children. Increased used of evidence-based interventions in
   urban schools would contribute to reducing mental health services
   disparities in low-income communities. School-wide positive behavioral
   interventions and supports (SWPBIS) is a service delivery framework that
   can be used to deliver universal preventive interventions and
   evidence-based behavioral health treatments, such as group cognitive
   behavioral therapy. In this article, we describe our ongoing research on
   creating internal capacity for program implementation. We also examine
   the cost-effectiveness and resulting school climate when two different
   levels of external support are provided to personnel as they implement a
   two-tier SWPBIS program.
   Methods/ Design: The study follows six K - 8 schools in the School
   District of Philadelphia randomly assigned to consultation support or
   consultation-plus-coaching support. Participants are: approximately 48
   leadership team members, 180 school staff and 3,900 students in Tier 1,
   and 12 counselors, and 306 child participants in Tier 2. Children who
   meet inclusion criteria for Tier 2 will participate in group cognitive
   behavioral therapy for externalizing or anxiety disorders. The study has
   three phases, baseline/training, implementation, and sustainability. We
   will measure implementation outcomes, service outcomes, child outcomes,
   and cost.
   Discussion: Findings from this study will provide evidence as to the
   appropriateness of school-wide prevention and treatment service delivery
   models for addressing services disparities in schools. The effectiveness
   and cost-effectiveness analyses of the two levels of training and
   consultation should help urban school districts and policymakers with
   the planning and deployment of cost-effective strategies for the
   implementation of evidence-based interventions for some of the most
   common behavioral health problems in school children.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the question: what are barriers to health behaviour
   theory development and modification, and what potential solutions can be
   proposed? Using the reasoned action approach (RAA) as a case study, four
   areas of theory development were examined: (1) the theoretical domain of
   a theory; (2) tension between generalisability and utility, (3) criteria
   for adding/removing variables in a theory, and (4) organisational
   tracking of theoretical developments and formal changes to theory. Based
   on a discussion of these four issues, recommendations for theory
   development are presented, including: (1) the theoretical domain for
   theories such as RAA should be clarified; (2) when there is tension
   between generalisability and utility, utility should be given preference
   given the applied nature of the health behaviour field; (3) variables
   should be formally removed/amended/added to a theory based on their
   performance across multiple studies and (4) organisations and
   researchers with a stake in particular health areas may be best suited
   for tracking the literature on behaviour-specific theories and making
   refinements to theory, based on a consensus approach. Overall, enhancing
   research in this area can provide important insights for more accurately
   understanding health behaviours and thus producing work that leads to
   more effective health behaviour change interventions.},

Abstract = {Objective: The study's aim was to investigate psychological, behavioral
   and medical long-term outcomes of an existing self-management
   intervention targeting the development of proactive coping skills (e.g.
   goal setting and identifying barriers) in type 2 diabetes patients. The
   study aimed to replicate prior research showing the intervention's
   effectiveness, and to extend it by (a) adding booster sessions and (b)
   prolonging the period of follow-up measurement to capture long-term
   effects.Design/outcome measures: A total of 141 type 2 diabetes patients
   were included in the intervention. The intervention employed a 5-step
   approach to target proactive coping skills. Psychological (e.g.
   proactive coping and self-efficacy) and behavioural variables (e.g.
   self-care, diet and physical activity) were assessed at baseline (T1),
   after the initial phase of the intervention (T2), after the booster
   phase (T3) and at follow-up (T4), comprising a total period of 15months.
   Medical variables were assessed at T1 and T4.Results: Employing
   piecewise Latent Growth Curve Modelling, results showed that
   participants improved on all psychological and behavioural variables
   during the initial phase and maintained these improvements over
   12months. The booster phase yielded no further improvements. Mixed
   findings were obtained on medical outcomes.Conclusion: The original
   intervention is effective, but the added value of the booster sessions
   is uncertain.},

Title = {A qualitative systematic review of studies using the normalization
   process theory to research implementation processes},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Background: There is a well-recognized need for greater use of theory to
   address research translational gaps. Normalization Process Theory (NPT)
   provides a set of sociological tools to understand and explain the
   social processes through which new or modified practices of thinking,
   enacting, and organizing work are implemented, embedded, and integrated
   in healthcare and other organizational settings. This review of NPT
   offers readers the opportunity to observe how, and in what areas, a
   particular theoretical approach to implementation is being used. In this
   article we review the literature on NPT in order to understand what
   interventions NPT is being used to analyze, how NPT is being
   operationalized, and the reported benefits, if any, of using NPT.
   Methods: Using a framework analysis approach, we conducted a qualitative
   systematic review of peer-reviewed literature using NPT. We searched 12
   electronic databases and all citations linked to six key NPT development
   papers. Grey literature/unpublished studies were not sought. Limitations
   of English language, healthcare setting and year of publication 2006 to
   June 2012 were set.
   Results: Twenty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria; in the main,
   NPT is being applied to qualitatively analyze a diverse range of complex
   interventions, many beyond its original field of e-health and
   telehealth. The NPT constructs have high stability across settings and,
   notwithstanding challenges in applying NPT in terms of managing overlaps
   between constructs, there is evidence that it is a beneficial heuristic
   device to explain and guide implementation processes.
   Conclusions: NPT offers a generalizable framework that can be applied
   across contexts with opportunities for incremental knowledge gain over
   time and an explicit framework for analysis, which can explain and
   potentially shape implementation processes. This is the first review of
   NPT in use and it generates an impetus for further and extended use of
   NPT. We recommend that in future NPT research, authors should explicate
   their rationale for choosing NPT as their theoretical framework and,
   where possible, involve multiple stakeholders including service users to
   enable analysis of implementation from a range of perspectives.},

Abstract = {Researchers in the field of health psychology have increasingly been
   involved in translating a body of knowledge about psychological factors
   associated with health-relevant behaviours, into the development and
   evaluation of interventions that seek to apply that knowledge. In this
   paper we argue that a changing economic and political climate, and the
   strong behavioural contribution to disease morbidity and mortality in
   developed nations, requires health psychologists to plan more rigorously
   for, and communicate more effectively, about how health promotion,
   social cognition and behaviour change interventions will have impact and
   be increasingly embedded into health services or health promotion
   activity. We explain academic and wider socio-economic uses of impact'
   in health services research. We describe the relationship between impact
   and dissemination, and impact as distinct from, but often used
   interchangeably with the terms implementation', knowledge transfer' and
   knowledge translation' (KT). The evidence for establishing impact is
   emergent. We therefore draw on a number of impact planning and KT
   frameworks, with reference to two self- management interventions, to
   describe a framework that we hope will support health psychologists in
   embedding impact planning and execution in research. We illustrate this
   further in an on-line annexe with reference to one of our own
   interventions, Mums-and-MS (see Supplemental Material).},

Title = {A quarter-century of HIV prevention intervention efforts among children
   and adolescents across the globe},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {231-251},
Abstract = {In 1988 a group of pediatricians, developmental, clinical, child and
   social psychologists, anthropologists and health educators began
   researching in Baltimore, Maryland, on an Human Immunodefiency Virus
   (HIV) prevention intervention, Focus on Youth (FOY). Over the next 25
   years, the questions being addressed by FOY reflected those of the
   global HIV research experience. During the first phase, the questions
   being addressed by the broader research community included: Can HIV risk
   behaviors be purposefully impacted by behavioral interventions? If so,
   how do successful interventions differ from those that are not
   effective? Are theory-based interventions more likely to be effective
   than information-onlybased interventions? Can theories be translated
   into culturally and developmentally appropriate interventions including
   those that are appropriate for children and adolescents? Should parents
   be involved -and if so, how? During its next phase, the FOY team
   increasingly became concerned with a disturbing reality. A large number
   of interventions had been developed and some had been shown to have
   evidence of impact. But virtually all of these interventions had been
   conducted in the USA or Europe. The questions facing researchers
   included: With the global burden of HIV disproportionately impacting
   low-and middle-income countries (LMIC), especially those in southern
   Africa, the Caribbean and parts of Asia, what is known about the
   effectiveness of western-based interventions in these culturally,
   racially and economically disparate settings? With the exciting
   proliferation of interventions, federal agencies in the USA and
   international agencies including Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/
   AIDS realized the importance of assessing the research portfolio and
   developing metrics of effectiveness. The questions during this phase
   included: What is an ``effective{''} intervention? How are effective
   interventions implemented in a new setting? This phase merged with the
   next phase as researchers and public health workers realized that the
   dissemination to a new community of an intervention developed and found
   to be effective in one community requires change. The central questions
   during this time included: What changes or kinds of changes can be made
   to an intervention without undermining its effectiveness? What aspects
   of an intervention cannot be changed without potentially undermining its
   effectiveness? What constitutes a `` change{''}? Who should be involved
   in this decision-making? These efforts culminated in our current phase,
   one focused on implementation. We must learn more about the factors that
   allow an intervention to survive and thrive and selectively target these
   critical factors. The main objective of this paper is to review our
   experiences and lessons learned in developing, implementing and
   evaluating FOY in a wide range of socio-cultural settings over the past
   quarter of century.},

Abstract = {Objective: To reanalyse a web-based intervention for physically
   untrained office workers with sub-acute non-specific low back pain in
   low back pain-related exercise behaviour terms. Design: Reanalysis of a
   randomized controlled trial. Setting: Occupational Preventive Medicine

   group (proposed intervention plus standard care) or a control group
   (usual care only). The intervention exercise and education materials
   were developed as an online resource, and included video demonstrations
   recorded in a laboratory. Resources were loaded onto a dedicated section

   included stretching, and exercises to improve postural stability
   (abdominal, lumbar, hip and thigh muscles) strength, flexibility and
   mobility. Outcome measures were self-reported health status (visual
   analogue scale (VAS) of the Euroquol-5D questionnaire); functional
   health status (Oswestry disability questionnaire); and the stage of
   change questionnaire. At ninemonths, outcomes in the intervention group
   were analysed and compared with baseline and outcomes in controls.
   Results: In the intervention group, significant positive effects were
   observed at nine-month follow up for stage of change in the behavioural
   domain as related with low back pain for all phases except for the
   contemplation phase. The positive change in the stage of change
   questionnaire correlated with the improvement observed in Oswestry
   (r=.388) and VAS (r=-.612). Conclusions: The reanalysis of the trial
   suggests that exercise behaviour related to low back pain improve after
   the intervention period. This improvement correlates with changes in
   clinical low back pain-related outcomes.},

Title = {Cluster randomized adaptive implementation trial comparing a standard
   versus enhanced implementation intervention to improve uptake of an
   effective re-engagement program for patients with serious mental illness},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},

Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Background: Persons with serious mental illness (SMI) are
   disproportionately burdened by premature mortality. This disparity is
   exacerbated by poor continuity of care with the health system. The
   Veterans Health Administration (VA) developed Re-Engage, an effective
   population-based outreach program to identify veterans with SMI lost to
   care and to reconnect them with VA services. However, such programs
   often encounter barriers getting implemented into routine care. Adaptive
   designs are needed when the implementation intervention requires
   augmentation within sites that do not initially respond to an initial
   implementation intervention. This protocol describes the methods used in
   an adaptive implementation design study that aims to compare the
   effectiveness of a standard implementation strategy (Replicating
   Effective Programs, or REP) with REP enhanced with External Facilitation
   (enhanced REP) to promote the uptake of Re-Engage.
   Methods/Design: This study employs a four-phase, two-arm, longitudinal,
   clustered randomized trial design. VA sites (n = 158) across the United
   States with a designated Re-Engage provider, at least one Veteran with
   SMI lost to care, and who received standard REP during a six-month
   run-in phase. Subsequently, 88 sites with inadequate uptake were
   stratified at the cluster level by geographic region (n = 4) and VA
   regional service network (n = 20) and randomized to REP (n = 49) vs.
   enhanced REP (n = 39) in phase two. The primary outcome was the
   percentage of veterans on each facility outreach list documented on an
   electronic web registry. The intervention was at the site and network
   level and consisted of standard REP versus REP enhanced by external
   phone facilitation consults. At 12 months, enhanced REP sites returned
   to standard REP and 36 sites with inadequate participation received
   enhanced REP for six months in phase three. Secondary implementation
   outcomes included the percentage of veterans contacted directly by site
   providers and the percentage re-engaged in VA health services.
   Discussion: Adaptive implementation designs consisting of a sequence of
   decision rules that are tailored based on a site's uptake of an
   effective program may produce more relevant, rapid, and generalizable
   results by more quickly validating or rejecting new implementation
   strategies, thus enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of
   implementation research and potentially leading to the rollout of more
   cost-efficient implementation strategies.},

Title = {Immediate versus sustained effects: interrupted time series analysis of
   a tailored intervention},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Background: Detailed intervention descriptions and robust evaluations
   that test intervention impact-and explore reasons for impact-are an
   essential part of progressing implementation science. Time series
   designs enable the impact and sustainability of intervention effects to
   be tested. When combined with time series designs, qualitative methods
   can provide insight into intervention effectiveness and help identify
   areas for improvement for future interventions. This paper describes the
   development, delivery, and evaluation of a tailored intervention
   designed to increase primary health care professionals' adoption of a
   national recommendation that women with mild to moderate postnatal
   depression (PND) are referred for psychological therapy as a first stage
   treatment.
   Methods: Three factors influencing referral for psychological treatment
   were targeted using three related intervention components: a tailored
   educational meeting, a tailored educational leaflet, and changes to an
   electronic system data template used by health professionals during
   consultations for PND. Evaluation comprised time series analysis of
   monthly audit data on percentage referral rates and monthly first
   prescription rates for antidepressants. Interviews were conducted with a
   sample of health professionals to explore their perceptions of the
   intervention components and to identify possible factors influencing
   intervention effectiveness.
   Results: The intervention was associated with a significant, immediate,
   positive effect upon percentage referral rates for psychological
   treatments. This effect was not sustained over the ten month follow-on
   period. Monthly rates of anti-depressant prescriptions remained
   consistently high after the intervention. Qualitative interview findings
   suggest key messages received from the intervention concerned what
   appropriate antidepressant prescribing is, suggesting this to underlie
   the lack of impact upon prescribing rates. However, an understanding
   that psychological treatment can have long-term benefits was also cited.
   Barriers to referral identified before intervention were cited again
   after the intervention, suggesting the intervention had not successfully
   tackled the barriers targeted.
   Conclusion: A time series design allowed the initial and sustained
   impact of our intervention to be tested. Combined with qualitative
   interviews, this provided insight into intervention effectiveness.
   Future research should test factors influencing intervention
   sustainability, and promote adoption of the targeted behavior and dis
   adoption of competing behaviors where appropriate.},

Title = {Knowledge translation strategies to improve the use of evidence in
   public health decision making in local government: intervention design
   and implementation plan},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {Background: Knowledge translation strategies are an approach to increase
   the use of evidence within policy and practice decision-making contexts.
   In clinical and health service contexts, knowledge translation
   strategies have focused on individual behavior change, however the
   multi-system context of public health requires a multi-level,
   multi-strategy approach. This paper describes the design of and
   implementation plan for a knowledge translation intervention for public
   health decision making in local government.
   Methods: Four preliminary research studies contributed findings to the
   design of the intervention: a systematic review of knowledge translation
   intervention effectiveness research, a scoping study of knowledge
   translation perspectives and relevant theory literature, a survey of the
   local government public health workforce, and a study of the use of
   evidence-informed decision-making for public health in local government.
   A logic model was then developed to represent the putative pathways
   between intervention inputs, processes, and outcomes operating between
   individual-, organizational-, and system-level strategies. This formed
   the basis of the intervention plan.
   Results: The systematic and scoping reviews identified that effective
   and promising strategies to increase access to research evidence require
   an integrated intervention of skill development, access to a knowledge
   broker, resources and tools for evidence-informed decision making, and
   networking for information sharing. Interviews and survey analysis
   suggested that the intervention needs to operate at individual and
   organizational levels, comprising workforce development, access to
   evidence, and regular contact with a knowledge broker to increase access
   to intervention evidence; develop skills in appraisal and integration of
   evidence; strengthen networks; and explore organizational factors to
   build organizational cultures receptive to embedding evidence in
   practice. The logic model incorporated these inputs and strategies with
   a set of outcomes to measure the intervention's effectiveness based on
   the theoretical frameworks, evaluation studies, and decision-maker
   experiences.
   Conclusion: Documenting the design of and implementation plan for this
   knowledge translation intervention provides a transparent, theoretical,
   and practical approach to a complex intervention. It provides
   significant insights into how practitioners might engage with evidence
   in public health decision making. While this intervention model was
   designed for the local government context, it is likely to be applicable
   and generalizable across sectors and settings.},

Title = {The dynamic sustainability framework: addressing the paradox of
   sustainment amid ongoing change},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Background: Despite growth in implementation research, limited
   scientific attention has focused on understanding and improving
   sustainability of health interventions. Models of sustainability have
   been evolving to reflect challenges in the fit between intervention and
   context.
   Discussion: We examine the development of concepts of sustainability,
   and respond to two frequent assumptions - `voltage drop,' whereby
   interventions are expected to yield lower benefits as they move from
   efficacy to effectiveness to implementation and sustainability, and
   `program drift,' whereby deviation from manualized protocols is assumed
   to decrease benefit. We posit that these assumptions limit opportunities
   to improve care, and instead argue for understanding the changing
   context of healthcare to continuously refine and improve interventions
   as they are sustained. Sustainability has evolved from being considered
   as the endgame of a translational research process to a suggested
   `adaptation phase' that integrates and institutionalizes interventions
   within local organizational and cultural contexts. These recent
   approaches locate sustainability in the implementation phase of
   knowledge transfer, but still do not address intervention improvement as
   a central theme. We propose a Dynamic Sustainability Framework that
   involves: continued learning and problem solving, ongoing adaptation of
   interventions with a primary focus on fit between interventions and
   multi-level contexts, and expectations for ongoing improvement as
   opposed to diminishing outcomes over time.
   Summary: A Dynamic Sustainability Framework provides a foundation for
   research, policy and practice that supports development and testing of
   falsifiable hypotheses and continued learning to advance the
   implementation, transportability and impact of health services research.},

Title = {Protocol for CONSORT-SPI: an extension for social and psychological
   interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Background: Determining the effectiveness of social and psychological
   interventions is important for improving individual and population
   health. Such interventions are complex and, where possible, are best
   evaluated by randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The use of research
   findings in policy and practice decision making is hindered by poor
   reporting of RCTs. Poor reporting limits the ability to replicate
   interventions, synthesise evidence in systematic reviews, and utilise
   findings for evidence-based policy and practice. The lack of guidance
   for reporting the specific methodological features of complex
   intervention RCTs contributes to poor reporting. We aim to develop an
   extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement
   for Social and Psychological Interventions (CONSORT-SPI).
   Methods/design: This research project will be conducted in five phases.
   The first phase was the project launch, which consisted of the
   establishment of a Project Executive and International Advisory Group,
   and recruitment of journal editors and the CONSORT Group. The second
   phase involves a Delphi process that will generate a list of possible
   items to include in the CONSORT Extension. Next, there will be a formal
   consensus meeting to select the reporting items to add to, or modify
   for, the CONSORT-SPI Extension. Fourth, guideline documents will be
   written, including an explanation and elaboration (E\&E) document that
   will provide detailed advice for each item and examples of good
   reporting. The final phase will comprise guideline dissemination, with
   simultaneous publication and endorsement of the guideline in multiple
   journals, endorsement by funding agencies, presentations at conferences
   and other meetings, and a dedicated website that will facilitate
   feedback about the guideline.
   Conclusion: As demonstrated by previous CONSORT guidelines, the
   development of an evidence-based reporting guideline for social and
   psychological intervention RCTs should improve the accuracy,
   comprehensiveness, and transparency of study reports. This, in turn,
   promises to improve the critical appraisal of research and its use in
   policy and practice decision making. We invite readers to participate in
   the project by visiting our website (http://tinyurl.com/CONSORT-study).},

Title = {A study protocol for applying the co-creating knowledge translation
   framework to a population health study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {Background: Population health research can generate significant outcomes
   for communities, while Knowledge Translation (KT) aims to expressly
   maximize the outcomes of knowledge producing activity. Yet the two
   approaches are seldom explicitly combined as part of the research
   process. A population health study in Port Lincoln, South Australia
   offered the opportunity to develop and apply the co-KT Framework to the
   entire research process. This is a new framework to facilitate knowledge
   formation collaboratively between researchers and communities throughout
   a research to intervention implementation process.
   Design: This study employs a five step framework (the co-KT Framework)
   that is formulated from engaged scholarship and action research
   principles. By following the steps a knowledge base will be cumulatively
   co-created with the study population that is useful to the research
   aims. Step 1 is the initiating of contact between the researcher and the
   study contexts, and the framing of the research issue, achieved through
   a systematic data collection tool. Step 2 refines the research issue and
   the knowledge base by building into it context specific details and
   conducting knowledge exchange events. Step 3 involves interpreting and
   analysing the knowledge base, and integrating evidence to inform
   intervention development. In Step 4 the intervention will be piloted and
   evaluated. Step 5 is the completion of the research process where
   outcomes for improvement will be instituted as regular practice with the
   facilitation of the community.
   In summary, the model uses an iterative knowledge construction mechanism
   that is complemented by external evidence to design interventions to
   address health priorities within the community.
   Discussion: This is a systematic approach that operationalises the
   translational cycle using a framework for KT practice. It begins with
   the local context as its foundation for knowledge creation and ends with
   the development of contextually applicable interventions. It will be of
   interest to those involved in KT research, participatory action
   research, population health research and health care systems studies.
   The co-KT Framework is a method for embedding the principles of KT into
   all stages of a community-based research process, in which research
   questions are framed by emergent data from each previous stage.},

Title = {Development of a framework and coding system for modifications and
   adaptations of evidence-based interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Background: Evidence-based interventions are frequently modified or
   adapted during the implementation process. Changes may be made to
   protocols to meet the needs of the target population or address
   differences between the context in which the intervention was originally
   designed and the one into which it is implemented {[}Addict Behav 2011,
   36(6):630-635]. However, whether modification compromises or enhances
   the desired benefits of the intervention is not well understood. A
   challenge to understanding the impact of specific types of modifications
   is a lack of attention to characterizing the different types of changes
   that may occur. A system for classifying the types of modifications that
   are made when interventions and programs are implemented can facilitate
   efforts to understand the nature of modifications that are made in
   particular contexts as well as the impact of these modifications on
   outcomes of interest.
   Methods: We developed a system for classifying modifications made to
   interventions and programs across a variety of fields and settings. We
   then coded 258 modifications identified in 32 published articles that
   described interventions implemented in routine care or community
   settings.
   Results: We identified modifications made to the content of
   interventions, as well as to the context in which interventions are
   delivered. We identified 12 different types of content modifications,
   and our coding scheme also included ratings for the level at which these
   modifications were made (ranging from the individual patient level up to
   a hospital network or community). We identified five types of contextual
   modifications (changes to the format, setting, or patient population
   that do not in and of themselves alter the actual content of the
   intervention). We also developed codes to indicate who made the
   modifications and identified a smaller subset of modifications made to
   the ways that training or evaluations occur when evidence-based
   interventions are implemented. Rater agreement analyses indicated that
   the coding scheme can be used to reliably classify modifications
   described in research articles without overly burdensome training.
   Conclusions: This coding system can complement research on fidelity and
   may advance research with the goal of understanding the impact of
   modifications made when evidence-based interventions are implemented.
   Such findings can further inform efforts to implement such interventions
   while preserving desired levels of program or intervention
   effectiveness.},

Title = {Development of a checklist to assess the quality of reporting of
   knowledge translation interventions using the Workgroup for Intervention
   Development and Evaluation Research (WIDER) recommendations},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Background: Influenced by an important paper by Michie et al., outlining
   the rationale and requirements for detailed reporting of behavior change
   interventions now required by Implementation Science, we created and
   refined a checklist to operationalize the Workgroup for Intervention
   Development and Evaluation Research (WIDER) recommendations in
   systematic reviews. The WIDER recommendations provide a framework to
   identify and provide detailed reporting of the essential components of
   behavior change interventions in order to facilitate replication,
   further development, and scale-up of the interventions.
   Findings: The checklist was developed, applied, and improved over the
   course of four systematic reviews of knowledge translation (KT)
   strategies in a variety of healthcare settings conducted by Scott and
   associates. The checklist was created as one method of operationalizing
   the work of the WIDER in order to facilitate comparison across
   heterogeneous studies included in these systematic reviews. Numerous
   challenges were encountered in the process of creating and applying the
   checklist across four stages of development. The resulting improvements
   have produced a `user-friendly' and replicable checklist to assess the
   quality of reporting of KT interventions in systematic reviews using the
   WIDER recommendations.
   Conclusions: With journals, such as Implementation Science, using the
   WIDER recommendations as publication requirements for evaluation reports
   of behavior change intervention studies, it is crucial to find methods
   of examining, measuring, and reporting the quality of reporting. This
   checklist is one approach to operationalize the WIDER recommendations in
   systematic review methodology.},

Abstract = {As this special issue shows, much research in social and personality
   psychology is directly relevant to health psychology. In this brief
   commentary, we discuss three topics in research methodology that may be
   of interest to investigators involved in health-related psychological
   research. The first topic is statistical analysis of mediated and
   moderated effects. The second is measurement of latent constructs. The
   third is the Multiphase Optimization Strategy, a framework for
   translation of innovations from social and personality psychology into
   behavioral interventions.},

Abstract = {Basic social psychological theories have much to contribute to our
   understanding of health problems and health-related behaviors and may
   provide potential avenues for intervention development. However, for
   these theories to have broader reach and applicability to the field of
   health psychology, more work needs to be done in integrating contexts
   into these theories and addressing more specifically their application
   across settings, behaviors, and populations. We argue that integration
   of these theories into a broader multidisciplinary and multilevel
   ecological framework is needed to enhance their translation into
   real-world applications. To enhance this translation, we make several
   recommendations, including breaking down silos between disciplinary
   perspectives and enhancing bidirectional communication and translation;
   analyzing boundary conditions of theories; expanding research approaches
   to move outside the laboratory and maintain a focus on external
   validity; and conducting efficacy testing of theories with meaningful,
   relevant endpoints.},

Abstract = {Progressive advancement of interventions in health psychology requires
   improvements in underlying theory. The theoretical advances described in
   this special issue offer a number of possibilities for intervention
   development. These include advances in understanding the role of
   cognitive biases, priming effects, effective planning, the role of
   specific affective states, and the influence of attachment style on
   response to interventions. For these advances to translate into
   progressive improvements in interventions and realized gains in public
   health, we propose that the theories should: (a) be explicitly linked to
   the major theories from which they draw; (b) reflect the context
   sensitivity and dynamic nature of the intervention target; (c) show
   convincing evidence of improved effectiveness of interventions they
   spawn according to rigorous criteria; and (d) address the full
   translation process, including implementation by health care providers
   and engagement by the target population.},

Title = {Proposing a conceptual framework for integrated local public health
   policy, applied to childhood obesity - the behavior change ball},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: Childhood obesity is a `wicked' public health problem that
   is best tackled by an integrated approach, which is enabled by
   integrated public health policies. The development and implementation of
   such policies have in practice proven to be difficult, however, and
   studying why this is the case requires a tool that may assist local
   policy-makers and those assisting them. A comprehensive framework that
   can help to identify options for improvement and to systematically
   develop solutions may be used to support local policy-makers.
   Discussion: We propose the `Behavior Change Ball' as a tool to study the
   development and implementation of integrated public health policies
   within local government. Based on the tenets of the `Behavior Change
   Wheel' by Michie and colleagues (2011), the proposed conceptual
   framework distinguishes organizational behaviors of local policy-makers
   at the strategic, tactical and operational levels, as well as the
   determinants (motivation, capability, opportunity) required for these
   behaviors, and interventions and policy categories that can influence
   them. To illustrate the difficulty of achieving sustained integrated
   approaches, we use the metaphor of a ball in our framework: the
   mountainous landscapes surrounding the ball reflect the system's
   resistance to change (by making it difficult for the ball to roll). We
   apply this framework to the problem of childhood obesity prevention. The
   added value provided by the framework lies in its comprehensiveness,
   theoretical basis, diagnostic and heuristic nature and face validity.
   Summary: Since integrated public health policies have not been widely
   developed and implemented in practice, organizational behaviors relevant
   to the development of these policies remain to be investigated. A
   conceptual framework that can assist in systematically studying the
   policy process may facilitate this. Our Behavior Change Ball adds
   significant value to existing public health policy frameworks by
   incorporating multiple theoretical perspectives, specifying a set of
   organizational behaviors and linking the analysis of these behaviors to
   interventions and policies. We would encourage examination by others of
   our framework as a tool to explain and guide the development of
   integrated policies for the prevention of wicked public health problems.},

Title = {Policy to implementation: evidence-based practice in community mental
   health - study protocol},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Background: Evidence-based treatments (EBTs) are not widely available in
   community mental health settings. In response to the call for
   implementation of evidence-based treatments in the United States, states
   and counties have mandated behavioral health reform through policies and
   other initiatives. Evaluations of the impact of these policies on
   implementation are rare. A systems transformation about to occur in
   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, offers an important opportunity to
   prospectively study implementation in response to a policy mandate.
   Methods/design: Using a prospective sequential mixed-methods design,
   with observations at multiple points in time, we will investigate the
   responses of staff from 30 community mental health clinics to a policy
   from the Department of Behavioral Health encouraging and incentivizing
   providers to implement evidence-based treatments to treat youth with
   mental health problems. Study participants will be 30 executive
   directors, 30 clinical directors, and 240 therapists. Data will be
   collected prior to the policy implementation, and then at two and four
   years following policy implementation. Quantitative data will include
   measures of intervention implementation and potential moderators of
   implementation (i.e., organizational-and leader-level variables) and
   will be collected from executive directors, clinical directors, and
   therapists. Measures include self-reported therapist fidelity to
   evidence-based treatment techniques as measured by the Therapist
   Procedures Checklist-Revised, organizational variables as measured by
   the Organizational Social Context Measurement System and the
   Implementation Climate Assessment, leader variables as measured by the
   Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, attitudes towards EBTs as measured
   by the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale, and knowledge of EBTs as
   measured by the Knowledge of Evidence-Based Services Questionnaire.
   Qualitative data will include semi-structured interviews with a subset
   of the sample to assess the implementation experience of high-,
   average-, and low-performing agencies. Mixed methods will be integrated
   through comparing and contrasting results from the two methods for each
   of the primary hypotheses in this study.
   Discussion: Findings from the proposed research will inform both future
   policy mandates around implementation and the support required for the
   success of these policies, with the ultimate goal of improving the
   quality of treatment provided to youth in the public sector.},

Abstract = {Obesity and related chronic illnesses are leading causes of death and
   excessive health care costs, necessitating identification of factors
   that can help patients achieve and maintain healthy weight. Greater
   self-efficacy and perceived spousal support in patients have been
   associated with successful weight management. The current study also
   assesses self-efficacy and perceived support in spouses and whether
   these factors are related to patient weight. At baseline of a spousal
   support trial, patients and spouses (N=255 couples) each completed
   measures of self-efficacy and spousal support for their own exercise and
   healthy eating behaviors. We fit a multivariable regression model to
   examine the relationship between these factors and patient weight.
   Patients were 95\% males and 65\% Whites, with average age of 61 years
   (SD=12) and weight of 212 lbs (SD=42). Spouses were 64\% Whites, with
   average age of 59 years (SD=12). Factors associated with lower patient
   weight were older patient age (estimate=0.8 lbs, p<.01), normal blood
   pressure (estimate=17.6 lbs, p<.01), higher patient self-efficacy for
   eating healthy (estimate=3.8 lbs, p=.02), and spouse greater perceived
   support for eating healthy (estimate=10.0 lbs, p=.03). Future research
   should explore the causal pathways between perceived support and health
   outcomes to establish whether patient support behaviors could be a point
   of intervention for weight management.},

Abstract = {We describe the development process and completed structure, of a
   self-help online intervention for bipolar disorder, known as MoodSwings
   (. The MoodSwings program was adapted as an Internet intervention from
   an efficacious and validated face-to-face, group-based psychosocial
   intervention. The adaptation was created by a psychologist, who had
   previously been involved with the validation of the face-to-face
   program, in collaboration with website designers. The project was
   conducted under the supervision of a team of clinician researchers. The
   website is available at no cost to registered participants. Self-help
   modules are accessed sequentially. Other features include a mood diary
   and a moderated discussion board. There has been an average of 1,475,135
   hits on the site annually (2008 and 2009), with some 7400 unique
   visitors each year. A randomised controlled trial based on this program
   has been completed. Many people with bipolar disorder are accepting of
   the Internet as a source of treatment and, once engaged, show acceptable
   retention rates. The Internet appears to be a viable means of delivering
   psychosocial self-help strategies.},

Abstract = {This review presents a case study of Government policy in relation to
   behaviour change and suggests ways of strengthening it by drawing on
   theoretical and empirical approaches from health psychology. It aims to
   inform policy-makers and politicians about the value of behavioural
   science, and to provide psychologists with an example of engagement with
   Government. It is based on two Health Psychology submissions to the 2010
   UK House of Lords' Science and Technology Select Committee inquiry into
   Behaviour Change. The Inquiry examined current knowledge about what
   interventions can effectively influence behaviour, how behaviour change
   interventions can be used to achieve policy goals and what factors
   should be taken into account by government in determining whether a
   particular behaviour change intervention is appropriate. The review
   critiques current UK Government thinking about behaviour change and
   presents a number of linked frameworks for determining which behaviour
   change interventions and policies it would be sensible to research and
   implement. These include the COM-B system, a systems approach to
   understanding behaviour in context; the PRIME Theory of motivation; the
   Behaviour Change Wheel, including a comprehensive listing of
   intervention functions and policy levers; and behaviour change
   techniques. We end with considerations of intervention development,
   effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.},

Title = {How hard can it be to include research evidence and evaluation in local
   health policy implementation? Results from a mixed methods study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Background: Although an evidence-based approach is the ideal model for
   planning and delivering healthcare, barriers exist to using research
   evidence to implement and evaluate service change. This paper aims to
   inform policy implementation and evaluation by understanding the role of
   research evidence at the local level through implementation of a
   national chronic conditions management policy.
   Methods: We conducted a national email survey of health service
   commissioners at the most devolved level of decision-making in Wales
   (Local Health Boards - LHBs) followed by in-depth interviews with
   representatives of LHBs, purposively selecting five to reflect
   geographic and economic characteristics. Survey data were analysed
   descriptively; we used thematic analysis for interview data.
   Results: All LHBs (n = 22) completed questionnaires. All reported they
   routinely assessed the research literature before implementing
   interventions, but free-text answers revealed wide variation in
   approach. Most commonly reported information sources included personal
   contacts, needs assessments, information or research databases. No
   consistent approach to evaluation was reported. Frequently reported
   challenges were: insufficient staff capacity (17/22); limited skills,
   cost, limited time, competing priorities (16/22); availability and
   quality of routine data (15/22). Respondents reported they would value
   central guidance on evaluation. Five interviews were held with managers
   from the five LHBs contacted. Service delivery decisions were informed
   by Welsh Government initiatives and priorities, budgets, perceived good
   practice, personal knowledge, and local needs, but did not include
   formal research evidence, they reported. Decision making was a
   collaborative process including clinical staff, patient representatives,
   and partner organization managers with varying levels of research
   experience. Robust evaluation data were required, but they were
   constrained by a lack of skills, time, and resources. They viewed
   evaluation as a means of demonstrating that targets had been met.
   Conclusions: There is a gap between evidence-based aims of national
   health policy and how health services are commissioned, implemented, and
   evaluated at local level. Commissioners and managers are unable to
   routinely incorporate research evidence. If health services research is
   to identify most effective ways to implement high quality care, it
   should be incorporated into commissioning and service delivery. Local
   commissioners and managers need to build the critical use of research
   evidence and evaluation into health policy implementation at local level
   in order to provide consistent and effective healthcare services.},

Title = {Implementing training and support, financial reimbursement, and referral
   to an internet-based brief advice program to improve the early
   identification of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption in primary
   care (ODHIN): study protocol for a cluster randomized factorial trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Background: The European level of alcohol consumption, and the
   subsequent burden of disease, is high compared to the rest of the world.
   While screening and brief interventions in primary healthcare are
   cost-effective, in most countries they have hardly been implemented in
   routine primary healthcare. In this study, we aim to examine the
   effectiveness and efficiency of three implementation interventions that
   have been chosen to address key barriers for improvement: training and
   support to address lack of knowledge and motivation in healthcare
   providers; financial reimbursement to compensate the time investment;
   and internet-based counselling to reduce workload for primary care
   providers.
   Methods/design: In a cluster randomized factorial trial, data from
   Catalan, English, Netherlands, Polish, and Swedish primary healthcare
   units will be collected on screening and brief advice rates for
   hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption. The three implementation
   strategies will be provided separately and in combination in a total of
   seven intervention groups and compared with a treatment as usual control
   group. Screening and brief intervention activities will be measured at
   baseline, during 12 weeks and after six months. Process measures include
   health professionals' role security and therapeutic commitment of the
   participating providers (SAAPPQ questionnaire). A total of 120 primary
   healthcare units will be included, equally distributed over the five
   countries. Both intention to treat and per protocol analyses are planned
   to determine intervention effectiveness, using random coefficient
   regression modelling.
   Discussion: Effective interventions to implement screening and brief
   interventions for hazardous alcohol use are urgently required. This
   international multi-centre trial will provide evidence to guide decision
   makers.},

Title = {``You've Got to Walk Before You Run{''}: Positive Evaluations of a
   Walking Program as Part of a Gender-Sensitized, Weight-Management
   Program Delivered to Men Through Professional Football Clubs},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {Objective: To explore men's views of a pedometer-based walking program,
   part of a weight-management intervention delivered through Scottish
   Premier League football clubs, and the congruence or challenge this
   poses to masculine identities. Methods: Semistructured telephone
   interviews with a sample of participants in a gender-sensitized, group
   weight-management program. Interviewing continued until data saturation
   was reached (n = 29). Results: All men were positive about the context,
   style of delivery, and content of the broader intervention. These things
   encouraged men to increase their physical activity (and adopt other
   behavioral changes) that they may not otherwise have found appealing.
   The success and acceptability of the walking program resided in three
   interrelated factors: (a) the utility of pedometers as a technology for
   motivation, self-monitoring and surveillance, and target setting; (b)
   the speed with which fitness was regained and weight reduced (enabling
   men to begin to do more desired forms of physical activity, and so
   regain visceral, experiential, and pragmatic masculine capital); and (c)
   bolstering their masculine identities through the receipt of the program
   in a valued, masculinised context. Conclusions: These data suggest that
   men will enthusiastically embrace a graduated walking program when the
   presentation is gender sensitive in context, content, and delivery.
   Pedometers were viewed as a valuable, reliable technological aid which
   motivated men and empowered them in self-monitoring of progress toward
   self-defined goals. Many men experienced the walking program as a means
   of regaining fitness, thereby enabling them to also regain valued
   masculine identities and activities, and a step toward regaining a more
   acceptable masculine body.},

Title = {Specifying content and mechanisms of change in interventions to change
   professionals' practice: an illustration from the Good Goals study in
   occupational therapy},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Background: It is widely agreed that interventions to change
   professionals' practice need to be clearly specified. This involves (1)
   selecting and defining the intervention techniques, (2) operationalising
   the techniques and deciding their delivery, and (3) formulating
   hypotheses about the mechanisms through which the techniques are thought
   to result in change. Descriptions of methods to achieve these objectives
   are limited. This paper reports methods and illustrates outputs from a
   study to meet these objectives, specifically from the Good Goals study
   to improve occupational therapists' caseload management practice.
   Methods: (1) Behaviour change techniques were identified and selected
   from an existing matrix that maps techniques to determinants. An
   existing coding manual was used to define the techniques. (2) A team of
   occupational therapists generated context-relevant, acceptable modes of
   delivery for the techniques; these data were compared and contrasted
   with previously collected data, literature on caseload management, and
   the aims of the intervention. (3) Hypotheses about the mechanisms of
   change were formulated by drawing on the matrix and on theories of
   behaviour change.
   Results: (1) Eight behaviour change techniques were selected: goal
   specified; self-monitoring; contract; graded tasks; increasing skills
   (problem solving, decision making, goal setting); coping skills;
   rehearsal of relevant skills; social processes of encouragement,
   support, and pressure; demonstration by others; and feedback. (2) A
   range of modes of delivery were generated (e. g., graded tasks'
   consisting of series of clinical cases and situations that become
   increasingly difficult). Conditions for acceptable delivery were
   identified (e. g., `self-monitoring' was acceptable only if delivered at
   team level). The modes of delivery were specified as face-to-face
   training, task sheets, group tasks, DVDs, and team-based weekly
   meetings. (3) The eight techniques were hypothesized to target caseload
   management practice through eleven mediating variables. Three domains
   were hypothesized to be most likely to change: beliefs about
   capabilities, motivation and goals, and behavioural regulation.
   Conclusions: The project provides an exemplar of a systematic and
   reportable development of a quality-improvement intervention, with its
   methods likely to be applicable to other projects. A subsequent study of
   the intervention has provided early indication that use of systematic
   methods to specify interventions may help to maximize acceptability and
   effectiveness.},

Title = {A systematic review of hand hygiene improvement strategies: a
   behavioural approach},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Background: Many strategies have been designed and evaluated to address
   the problem of low hand hygiene (HH) compliance. Which of these
   strategies are most effective and how they work is still unclear. Here
   we describe frequently used improvement strategies and related
   determinants of behaviour change that prompt good HH behaviour to
   provide a better overview of the choice and content of such strategies.
   Methods: Systematic searches of experimental and quasi-experimental
   research on HH improvement strategies were conducted in Medline, Embase,
   CINAHL, and Cochrane databases from January 2000 to November 2009.
   First, we extracted the study characteristics using the EPOC Data
   Collection Checklist, including study objectives, setting, study design,
   target population, outcome measures, description of the intervention,
   analysis, and results. Second, we used the Taxonomy of Behavioural
   Change Techniques to identify targeted determinants.
   Results: We reviewed 41 studies. The most frequently addressed
   determinants were knowledge, awareness, action control, and facilitation
   of behaviour. Fewer studies addressed social influence, attitude,
   self-efficacy, and intention. Thirteen studies used a controlled design
   to measure the effects of HH improvement strategies on HH behaviour. The
   effectiveness of the strategies varied substantially, but most
   controlled studies showed positive results. The median effect size of
   these strategies increased from 17.6 (relative difference) addressing
   one determinant to 49.5 for the studies that addressed five
   determinants.
   Conclusions: By focussing on determinants of behaviour change, we found
   hidden and valuable components in HH improvement strategies. Addressing
   only determinants such as knowledge, awareness, action control, and
   facilitation is not enough to change HH behaviour. Addressing
   combinations of different determinants showed better results. This
   indicates that we should be more creative in the application of
   alternative improvement activities addressing determinants such as
   social influence, attitude, self-efficacy, or intention.},

Title = {Developing the Autism Model of Implementation for Autism spectrum
   disorder community providers: study protocol},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Background: Currently, 1 out of 88 children are diagnosed with an autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD), and the estimated cost for treatment services
   is \$126 billion annually. Typically, ASD community providers (ASD-CPs)
   provide services to children with any severity of ASD symptoms using a
   combination of various treatment paradigms, some with an evidence-base
   and some without. When evidence-based practices (EBPs) are successfully
   implemented by ASD-CPs, they can result in positive outcomes. Despite
   this promise, EBPs are often implemented unsuccessfully and other
   treatments used by ASD-CPs lack supportive evidence, especially for
   school-age children with ASD. While it is not well understood why
   ASD-CPs are not implementing EBPs, organizational and individual
   characteristics likely play a role. As a response to this need and to
   improve the lives of children with ASD and their families, this study
   aims to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of the Autism
   Model of Implementation (AMI) to support the implementation of EBPs by
   ASD-CPs.
   Methods/design: An academic-community collaboration developed to partner
   with ASD-CPs will facilitate the development of the AMI, a process
   specifically for use by ASD community-based agencies. Using a mixed
   methods approach, the project will assess agency and individual factors
   likely to facilitate or hinder implementing EBPs in this context;
   develop the AMI to address identified barriers and facilitators; and
   pilot test the AMI to examine its feasibility and acceptability using a
   specific EBP to treat anxiety disorders in school-age children with ASD.
   Discussion: The AMI will represent a data-informed approach to
   facilitate implementation of EBPs by ASD-CPs by providing an
   implementation model specifically developed for this context. This study
   is designed to address the real-world implications of EBP implementation
   in ASD community-based agencies. In doing so, the AMI will help to
   provide children with ASD the best and most effective services in their
   own community. Moreover, the proposed study will positively impact the
   field of implementation science by providing an empirically supported
   and tested model of implementation to facilitate the identification,
   adoption, and use of EBPs.},

Title = {Using psychological theory to inform methods to optimize the
   implementation of a hand hygiene intervention},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Background: Careful hand hygiene (HH) is the single most important
   factor in preventing the transmission of infections to patients, but
   compliance is difficult to achieve and maintain. A lack of understanding
   of the processes involved in changing staff behaviour may contribute to
   the failure to achieve success. The purpose of this study was to
   identify nurses' and administrators' perceived barriers and facilitators
   to current HH practices and the implementation of a new electronic
   monitoring technology for HH.
   Methods: Ten key informant interviews (three administrators and seven
   nurses) were conducted to explore barriers and facilitators related to
   HH and the impact of the new technology on outcomes. The semi structured
   interviews were based on the Theoretical Domains Framework by Michie et
   al. and conducted prior to intervention implementation. Data were
   explored using an inductive qualitative analysis approach. Data between
   administrators and nurses were compared.
   Results: In 9 of the 12 domains, nurses and administrators differed in
   their responses. Administrators believed that nurses have insufficient
   knowledge and skills to perform HH, whereas the nurses were confident
   they had the required knowledge and skills. Nurses focused on immediate
   consequences, whereas administrators highlighted long-term outcomes of
   the system. Nurses concentrated foremost on their personal safety and
   their families' safety as a source of motivation to perform HH, whereas
   administrators identified professional commitment, incentives, and goal
   setting. Administrators stated that the staff do not have the decision
   processes in place to judge whether HH is necessary or not. They also
   highlighted the positive aspects of teams as a social influence, whereas
   nurses were not interested in group conformity or being compared to
   others. Nurses described the importance of individual feedback and
   self-monitoring in order to increase their performance, whereas
   administrators reported different views.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the benefits of using a structured
   approach based on psychological theory to inform an implementation plan
   for a behavior change intervention. This work is an essential step
   towards systematically identifying factors affecting nurses' behaviour
   associated with HH.},

Title = {Brief cognitive behavioral therapy in primary care: a hybrid type 2
   patient-randomized effectiveness-implementation design},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the availability of evidence-based psychotherapies
   for depression and anxiety, they are underused in non-mental health
   specialty settings such as primary care. Hybrid
   effectiveness-implementation designs have the potential to evaluate
   clinical and implementation outcomes of evidence-based psychotherapies
   to improve their translation into routine clinical care practices.
   Methods: This protocol article discusses the study methodology and
   implementation strategies employed in an ongoing, hybrid, type 2
   randomized controlled trial with two primary aims: (1) to determine
   whether a brief, manualized cognitive behavioral therapy administered by
   Veterans Affairs Primary Care Mental Health Integration program
   clinicians is effective in treating depression and anxiety in a sample
   of medically ill (chronic cardiopulmonary diseases) primary care
   patients and (2) to examine the acceptability, feasibility, and
   preliminary outcomes of a focused implementation strategy on improving
   adoption and fidelity of brief cognitive behavioral therapy at two
   Primary Care-Mental Health Integration clinics. The study uses a hybrid
   type 2 effectiveness/implementation design to simultaneously test
   clinical effectiveness and to collect pilot data on a multifaceted
   implementation strategy that includes an online training program, audit
   and feedback of session content, and internal and external facilitation.
   Additionally, the study engages the participation of an advisory council
   consisting of stakeholders from Primary Care-Mental Health Integration,
   as well as regional and national mental health leaders within the
   Veterans Administration. It targets recruitment of 320 participants
   randomized to brief cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 200) or usual care
   (n = 120). Both effectiveness and implementation outcomes are being
   assessed using mixed methods, including quantitative evaluation (e. g.,
   intent-to-treat analyses across multiple time points) and qualitative
   methods (e. g., focus interviews and surveys from patients and
   providers). Patient-effectiveness outcomes include measures of
   depression, anxiety, and physical health functioning using blinded
   independent evaluators. Implementation outcomes include patient
   engagement and adherence and clinician brief cognitive behavioral
   therapy adoption and fidelity.
   Conclusions: Hybrid designs are needed to advance clinical effectiveness
   and implementation knowledge to improve healthcare practices. The
   current article describes the rationale and challenges associated with
   the use of a hybrid design for the study of brief cognitive behavioral
   therapy in primary care. Although trade-offs exist between scientific
   control and external validity, hybrid designs are part of an emerging
   approach that has the potential to rapidly advance both science and
   practice.},

Abstract = {Objective: Although health cognitions are regarded as key determinants
   for health behavior change, they are rarely studied from a dynamic
   perspective, evaluating the impact of changes in cognitions on changes
   in behavior. In the present study, we examine how changes in
   phase-specific and generic health cognitions influence first, the
   adoption of exercise and later, the maintenance of the newly acquired
   behavior. Methods: Participants were middle-aged, Finnish adults
   participating in a lifestyle intervention to prevent Type 2 diabetes (N
   = 389). Health cognitions and exercise were measured at baseline
   (preintervention) and twice after a lifestyle intervention took place
   (at 3 months and after I year). Results: The results show that both
   phase-specific and generic health cognitions changed during the
   intervention. However, these changes were most pronounced within those
   participants who started at a lower level to begin with. Most important,
   evidence for the dynamic interplay between changes in health cognitions
   and health behavior was observed: Phase-specific health cognitions
   facilitated the adoption as well as the maintenance of behavior changes.
   Conclusions: Thus, health cognitions are amenable to change, and these
   changes are adaptive in terms of initiating and maintaining health
   behavior change. This has implications both for practical intervention
   research, as well as for theory development.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of Psychological Interventions for Adolescents and
   Young Adults Living With Chronic Illness},

Abstract = {Objective: There is increasing recognition that adolescents and young
   adults (AYAs) with chronic illnesses experience common psychological
   challenges. This article reviewed published psychological interventions
   for AYAs with cancer, diabetes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, sickle
   cell disease, and asthma. Common, efficacious intervention components
   were examined to generate clearer recommendations for future
   age-appropriate, evidence-based intervention development. Methods: Five
   databases including MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process \& Non-Indexed
   Citations, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL, were searched for studies
   involving AYAs aged 10-30 years, using quantitative two-group methods,
   published from 1979-2010. Of 1,233 abstracts, 87 were extracted for
   further analysis and a final 25 studies were eligible for inclusion.
   Thirteen of these studies included AYAs with diabetes, 7 studies
   involved AYAs with cancer, and 5 included AYAs with other illnesses.
   Results: Educational interventions showed some significant positive
   results, particularly when targeted knowledge outcomes were measured.
   Several skills-based programs, some including parents, showed positive
   results, with moderate effect sizes. Interventions which taught
   communication skills, incorporated practical components (e.g.,
   role-plays, homework), involved >= 6 sessions, and spanned at least 3
   months in length, appeared more likely to achieve positive outcomes.
   Conclusions: Skills-based interventions delivered over multiple sessions
   may yield the most positive results in AYAs with chronic illness. Given
   the few peer-support groups eligible for review, their efficacy remains
   unclear. This review points to the need for intervention development
   that teaches adaptive coping skills, is grounded in theoretical
   frameworks, and adheres to strict randomization and independent
   assessments to evaluate efficacy in assisting AYAs adjust to chronic
   illness.},

Title = {Validation of the theoretical domains framework for use in behaviour

Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Background: An integrative theoretical framework, developed for
   cross-disciplinary implementation and other behaviour change research,
   has been applied across a wide range of clinical situations. This study
   tests the validity of this framework.
   Methods: Validity was investigated by behavioural experts sorting 112
   unique theoretical constructs using closed and open sort tasks. The
   extent of replication was tested by Discriminant Content Validation and
   Fuzzy Cluster Analysis.
   Results: There was good support for a refinement of the framework
   comprising 14 domains of theoretical constructs (average silhouette
   value 0.29): `Knowledge', `Skills', `Social/Professional Role and
   Identity', `Beliefs about Capabilities', `Optimism', `Beliefs about
   Consequences', `Reinforcement', `Intentions', `Goals', `Memory,
   Attention and Decision Processes', `Environmental Context and
   Resources', `Social Influences', `Emotions', and `Behavioural
   Regulation'.
   Conclusions: The refined Theoretical Domains Framework has a
   strengthened empirical base and provides a method for theoretically
   assessing implementation problems, as well as professional and other
   health-related behaviours as a basis for intervention development.},

Title = {Theories of behaviour change synthesised into a set of theoretical
   groupings: introducing a thematic series on the theoretical domains
   framework},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Behaviour change is key to increasing the uptake of evidence into
   healthcare practice. Designing behaviour-change interventions first
   requires problem analysis, ideally informed by theory. Yet the large
   number of partly overlapping theories of behaviour makes it difficult to
   select the most appropriate theory. The need for an overarching
   theoretical framework of behaviour change was addressed in research in
   which 128 explanatory constructs from 33 theories of behaviour were
   identified and grouped. The resulting Theoretical Domains Framework
   (TDF) appears to be a helpful basis for investigating implementation
   problems. Research groups in several countries have conducted TDF-based
   studies. It seems timely to bring together the experience of these teams
   in a thematic series to demonstrate further applications and to report
   key developments. This overview article describes the TDF, provides a
   brief critique of the framework, and introduces this thematic series.
   In a brief review to assess the extent of TDF-based research, we
   identified 133 papers that cite the framework. Of these, 17 used the TDF
   as the basis for empirical studies to explore health professionals'
   behaviour. The identified papers provide evidence of the impact of the
   TDF on implementation research. Two major strengths of the framework are
   its theoretical coverage and its capacity to elicit beliefs that could
   signify key mediators of behaviour change. The TDF provides a useful
   conceptual basis for assessing implementation problems, designing
   interventions to enhance healthcare practice, and understanding
   behaviour-change processes. We discuss limitations and research
   challenges and introduce papers in this series.},

Title = {Developing theory-informed behaviour change interventions to implement
   evidence into practice: a systematic approach using the Theoretical
   Domains Framework},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Background: There is little systematic operational guidance about how
   best to develop complex interventions to reduce the gap between practice
   and evidence. This article is one in a Series of articles documenting
   the development and use of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to
   advance the science of implementation research.
   Methods: The intervention was developed considering three main
   components: theory, evidence, and practical issues. We used a four-step
   approach, consisting of guiding questions, to direct the choice of the
   most appropriate components of an implementation intervention: Who needs
   to do what, differently? Using a theoretical framework, which barriers
   and enablers need to be addressed? Which intervention components
   (behaviour change techniques and mode(s) of delivery) could overcome the
   modifiable barriers and enhance the enablers? And how can behaviour
   change be measured and understood?
   Results: A complex implementation intervention was designed that aimed
   to improve acute low back pain management in primary care. We used the
   TDF to identify the barriers and enablers to the uptake of evidence into
   practice and to guide the choice of intervention components. These
   components were then combined into a cohesive intervention. The
   intervention was delivered via two facilitated interactive small group
   workshops. We also produced a DVD to distribute to all participants in
   the intervention group. We chose outcome measures in order to assess the
   mediating mechanisms of behaviour change.
   Conclusions: We have illustrated a four-step systematic method for
   developing an intervention designed to change clinical practice based on
   a theoretical framework. The method of development provides a systematic
   framework that could be used by others developing complex implementation
   interventions. While this framework should be iteratively adjusted and
   refined to suit other contexts and settings, we believe that the
   four-step process should be maintained as the primary framework to guide

Title = {Implementation outcomes of evidence-based quality improvement for
   depression in VA community based outpatient clinics},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {Background: Collaborative-care management is an evidence-based practice
   for improving depression outcomes in primary care. The Department of
   Veterans Affairs (VA) has mandated the implementation of
   collaborative-care management in its satellite clinics, known as
   Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). However, the organizational
   characteristics of CBOCs present added challenges to implementation. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
   evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) as a strategy to facilitate
   the adoption of collaborative-care management in CBOCs.
   Methods: This nonrandomized, small-scale, multisite evaluation of EBQI
   was conducted at three VA Medical Centers and 11 of their affiliated
   CBOCs. The Plan phase of the EBQI process involved the localized
   tailoring of the collaborative-care management program to each CBOC.
   Researchers ensured that the adaptations were evidence based. Clinical
   and administrative staff were responsible for adapting the
   collaborative-care management program for local needs, priorities,
   preferences and resources. Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were used to refine
   the program over time. The evaluation was based on the RE-AIM (Reach,
   Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) Framework and used
   data from multiple sources: administrative records, web-based
   decision-support systems, surveys, and key-informant interviews.
   Results: Adoption: 69.0\% (58/84) of primary care providers referred
   patients to the program. Reach: 9.0\% (298/3,296) of primary care
   patients diagnosed with depression who were not already receiving
   specialty care were enrolled in the program. Fidelity: During baseline
   care manager encounters, education/activation was provided to 100\%
   (298/298) of patients, barriers were assessed and addressed for 100\%
   (298/298) of patients, and depression severity was monitored for 100\%
   (298/298) of patients. Less than half (42.5\%, 681/1603) of follow-up
   encounters during the acute stage were completed within the timeframe
   specified. During the acute phase of treatment for all trials, the
   Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) symptom-monitoring tool was used at
   100\% (681/681) of completed follow-up encounters, and self-management
   goals were discussed during 15.3\% (104/681) of completed follow-up
   encounters. During the acute phase of treatment for pharmacotherapy and
   combination trials, medication adherence was assessed at 99.1\%
   (575/580) of completed follow-up encounters, and side effects were
   assessed at 92.4\% (536/580) of completed follow-up encounters. During
   the acute phase of treatment for psychotherapy and combination trials,
   counseling session adherence was assessed at 83.3\% (239/287) of
   completed follow-up encounters. Effectiveness: 18.8\% (56/298) of
   enrolled patients remitted (symptom free) and another 22.1\% (66/298)
   responded to treatment (50\% reduction in symptom severity).
   Maintenance: 91.9\% (10/11) of the CBOCs chose to sustain the program
   after research funds were withdrawn.},

Abstract = {Background: The introduction of evidence-based programs and practices
   into healthcare settings has been the subject of an increasing amount of
   research in recent years. While a number of studies have examined
   initial implementation efforts, less research has been conducted to
   determine what happens beyond that point. There is increasing
   recognition that the extent to which new programs are sustained is
   influenced by many different factors and that more needs to be known
   about just what these factors are and how they interact. To understand
   the current state of the research literature on sustainability, our team
   took stock of what is currently known in this area and identified areas
   in which further research would be particularly helpful. This paper
   reviews the methods that have been used, the types of outcomes that have
   been measured and reported, findings from studies that reported
   long-term implementation outcomes, and factors that have been identified
   as potential influences on the sustained use of new practices, programs,
   or interventions. We conclude with recommendations and considerations
   for future research.
   Methods: Two coders identified 125 studies on sustainability that met
   eligibility criteria. An initial coding scheme was developed based on
   constructs identified in previous literature on implementation.
   Additional codes were generated deductively. Related constructs among
   factors were identified by consensus and collapsed under the general
   categories. Studies that described the extent to which programs or
   innovations were sustained were also categorized and summarized.
   Results: Although ``sustainability{''} was the term most commonly used
   in the literature to refer to what happened after initial
   implementation, not all the studies that were reviewed actually
   presented working definitions of the term. Most study designs were
   retrospective and naturalistic. Approximately half of the studies relied
   on self-reports to assess sustainability or elements that influence
   sustainability. Approximately half employed quantitative methodologies,
   and the remainder employed qualitative or mixed methodologies. Few
   studies that investigated sustainability outcomes employed rigorous
   methods of evaluation (e.g., objective evaluation, judgement of
   implementation quality or fidelity). Among those that did, a small
   number reported full sustainment or high fidelity. Very little research
   has examined the extent, nature, or impact of adaptations to the
   interventions or programs once implemented. Influences on sustainability
   included organizational context, capacity, processes, and factors
   related to the new program or practice themselves.
   Conclusions: Clearer definitions and research that is guided by the
   conceptual literature on sustainability are critical to the development
   of the research in the area. Further efforts to characterize the
   phenomenon and the factors that influence it will enhance the quality of
   future research. Careful consideration must also be given to
   interactions among influences at multiple levels, as well as issues such
   as fidelity, modification, and changes in implementation over time.
   While prospective and experimental designs are needed, there is also an
   important role for qualitative research in efforts to understand the
   phenomenon, refine hypotheses, and develop strategies to promote
   sustainment.},

Title = {Implementation of the CALM intervention for anxiety disorders: a
   qualitative study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Background: Investigators recently tested the effectiveness of a
   collaborative-care intervention for anxiety disorders: Coordinated
   Anxiety Learning and Management(CALM) (sic)) in 17 primary care clinics
   around the United States. Investigators also conducted a qualitative
   process evaluation. Key research questions were as follows: (1) What
   were the facilitators/barriers to implementing CALM? (2) What were the
   facilitators/barriers to sustaining CALM after the study was completed?
   Methods: Key informant interviews were conducted with 47 clinic staff
   members (18 primary care providers, 13 nurses, 8 clinic administrators,
   and 8 clinic staff) and 14 study-trained anxiety clinical specialists
   (ACSs) who coordinated the collaborative care and provided cognitive
   behavioral therapy. The interviews were semistructured and conducted by
   phone. Data were content analyzed with line-by-line analyses leading to
   the development and refinement of themes. Results: Similar themes
   emerged across stakeholders. Important facilitators to implementation
   included the perception of ``low burden{''} to implement, provider
   satisfaction with the intervention, and frequent provider interaction
   with ACSs. Barriers to implementation included variable provider
   interest in mental health, high rates of part-time providers in clinics,
   and high social stressors of lower socioeconomic-status patients
   interfering with adherence. Key sustainability facilitators were if a
   clinic had already incorporated collaborative care for another disorder
   and presence of onsite mental health staff. The main barrier to
   sustainability was funding for the ACS. Conclusions: The CALM
   intervention was relatively easy to incorporate during the effectiveness
   trial, and satisfaction was generally high. Numerous implementation and
   sustainability barriers could limit the reach and impact of widespread
   adoption. Findings should be interpreted with the knowledge that the
   ACSs in this study were provided and trained by the study. Future
   research should explore uptake of CALM and similar interventions without
   the aid of an effectiveness trial.},

Abstract = {This study tested the effect of interventions designed for people who do
   not eat yet the recommended daily fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) but
   have a positive intention to do so. Adults (N = 163) aged 20-65 were
   randomised into four groups: implementation intentions (II group),
   self-efficacy (SE group), combination of II+SE group) and a control
   group receiving written information on nutrition. Study variables were
   measured at baseline, post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up. At
   follow-up, compared to the control group, FVI increased significantly in
   the II and II+SE groups (1.5 and 1.9 servings per day, respectively).
   Most psychosocial variables significantly increased compared to the
   control group, with the exception of SE for vegetable intake (VI).
   Moreover, at 3-month follow-up, change in FVI was mediated by changes in
   fruit intake (FI) intention and VI action planning. In conclusion, II
   interventions were efficient to increase FVI, with or without
   consideration for the development of SE. Thus, future studies should
   favour the adoption of this approach to bridge the intention-behaviour
   gap for FVI.},

Abstract = {Many individuals are motivated to improve their physical activity
   levels, but often fail to act upon their intention. Interventions
   fostering volitional strategies, such as action planning, coping
   planning, and self-efficacy beliefs, can help to translate intentions
   into behavior. This study examines the effectiveness and the mechanisms
   of a combined planning and self-efficacy intervention to promote
   physical activity among motivated individuals. Participants (N = 883)
   were randomly assigned to the intervention or to a waiting-list control
   condition. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the
   intervention resulted in significantly more physical activity, higher
   levels of action planning, coping planning, and volitional self-efficacy
   beliefs (p < 0.01). In addition, multiple mediation analysis showed that
   action planning, coping planning, and volitional self-efficacy mediate
   between the intervention and physical activity. The study shows that the
   intervention successfully fostered physical activity and unfolds the
   underlying self-regulatory mechanisms of the intervention's
   effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Background: Specifying individual behaviour change techniques (BCTs) is
   crucial for better development and evaluation of behaviour change
   interventions. Classification of BCTs will help this process and can be
   informed by classification systems in the natural, medical and social
   sciences. Method: A search of the classification literature in the
   natural, medical and social sciences produced a framework within which
   to consider a systematic search of classification systems of BCTs in the
   behaviour change literature. Results: Six distinct types of
   classification system from other scientific disciplines were identified:
   nomenclatures, ordered sets, hierarchical, matrices, faceted and social
   categorisations. Eight classification systems of BCTs were identified,
   none of which had a formal, hierarchical structure. Most were developed
   for specific behaviours, although one was general. Discussion:
   Developing a hierarchical structure, similar to those used in other
   scientific disciplines, would enable better communication and
   understanding of BCTs and inform the development and evaluation of
   interventions. Hierarchical structured classification systems contain
   many of the characteristics most desirable in a classification of BCTs.},

Title = {Challenges of nurse delivery of psychological interventions for
   long-term conditions in primary care: a qualitative exploration of the
   case of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalitis},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {Background: The evidence base for a range of psychosocial and
   behavioural interventions in managing and supporting patients with
   long-term conditions (LTCs) is now well-established. With increasing
   numbers of such patients being managed in primary care, and a shortage
   of specialists in psychology and behavioural management to deliver
   interventions, therapeutic interventions are increasingly being
   delivered by general nurses with limited training in psychological
   interventions. It is unknown what issues this raises for the nurses or
   their patients. The purpose of the study was to examine the challenges
   faced by non-specialist nurses when delivering psychological
   interventions for an LTC (chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic
   encephalomyelitis {[}CFS/ME]) within a primary care setting.
   Methods: A qualitative study nested within a randomised controlled trial
   {[}ISRCTN 74156610] explored the experiences and acceptability of two
   different psychological interventions (pragmatic rehabilitation and
   supportive listening) from the perspectives of nurses, their
   supervisors, and patients. Semi structured in-depth interviews were
   conducted with three nurse therapists, three supervisors, and 46
   patients. An iterative approach was used to develop conceptual
   categories from the dataset.
   Results: Analyses identified four sets of challenges that were common to
   both interventions: (i) being a novice therapist, (ii) engaging patients
   in the therapeutic model, (iii) dealing with emotions, and (iv) the
   complexity of primary care. Each challenge had the potential to cause
   tension between therapist and patient. A number of strategies were
   developed by participants to manage the tensions.
   Conclusions: Tensions existed for nurses when attempting to deliver
   psychological interventions for patients with CFS/ME in this primary
   care trial. Such tensions should be addressed before implementing
   psychological interventions within routine clinical practice. Similar
   tensions may be found for other LTCs. Our findings have implications for
   developing therapeutic alliances and highlight the need for regular
   supervision.},

Title = {Implementing collaborative care for depression treatment in primary
   care: A cluster randomized evaluation of a quality improvement practice
   redesign},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Background: Meta-analyses show collaborative care models (CCMs) with
   nurse care management are effective for improving primary care for
   depression. This study aimed to develop CCM approaches that could be
   sustained and spread within Veterans Affairs (VA). Evidence-based
   quality improvement (EBQI) uses QI approaches within a research/clinical
   partnership to redesign care. The study used EBQI methods for CCM
   redesign, tested the effectiveness of the locally adapted model as
   implemented, and assessed the contextual factors shaping intervention
   effectiveness.
   Methods: The study intervention is EBQI as applied to CCM
   implementation. The study uses a cluster randomized design as a
   formative evaluation tool to test and improve the effectiveness of the
   redesign process, with seven intervention and three non-intervention VA
   primary care practices in five different states. The primary study
   outcome is patient antidepressant use. The context evaluation is
   descriptive and uses subgroup analysis. The primary context evaluation
   measure is naturalistic primary care clinician (PCC) predilection to
   adopt CCM. For the randomized evaluation, trained telephone research
   interviewers enrolled consecutive primary care patients with major
   depression in the evaluation, referred enrolled patients in intervention
   practices to the implemented CCM, and re-surveyed at seven months.
   Results: Interviewers enrolled 288 CCM site and 258 non-CCM site
   patients. Enrolled intervention site patients were more likely to
   receive appropriate antidepressant care (66\% versus 43\%, p = 0.01),
   but showed no significant difference in symptom improvement compared to
   usual care. In terms of context, only 40\% of enrolled patients received
   complete care management per protocol. PCC predilection to adopt CCM had
   substantial effects on patient participation, with patients belonging to
   early adopter clinicians completing adequate care manager follow-up
   significantly more often than patients of clinicians with low
   predilection to adopt CCM (74\% versus 48\%\%, p = 0.003).
   Conclusions: Depression CCM designed and implemented by primary care
   practices using EBQI improved antidepressant initiation. Combining QI
   methods with a randomized evaluation proved challenging, but enabled new
   insights into the process of translating research-based CCM into
   practice. Future research on the effects of PCC attitudes and skills on
   CCM results, as well as on enhancing the link between improved
   antidepressant use and symptom outcomes, is needed.},

Title = {Use of RE-AIM to develop a multi-media facilitation tool for the
   patient-centered medical home},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Background: Much has been written about how the medical home model can
   enhance patient-centeredness, care continuity, and follow-up, but few
   comprehensive aids or resources exist to help practices accomplish these
   aims. The complexity of primary care can overwhelm those concerned with
   quality improvement.
   Methods: The RE-AIM planning and evaluation model was used to develop a
   multimedia, multiple-health behavior tool with psychosocial assessment
   and feedback features to facilitate and guide patient-centered
   communication, care, and follow-up related to prevention and
   self-management of the most common adult chronic illnesses seen in
   primary care.
   Results: The Connection to Health Patient Self-Management System, a
   web-based patient assessment and support resource, was developed using
   the RE-AIM factors of reach (e.g., allowing input and output via choice
   of different modalities), effectiveness (e.g., using evidence-based
   intervention strategies), adoption (e.g., assistance in integrating the
   system into practice workflows and permitting customization of the
   website and feedback materials by practice teams), implementation (e.g.,
   identifying and targeting actionable priority behavioral and
   psychosocial issues for patients and teams), and
   maintenance/sustainability (e.g., integration with current National
   Committee for Quality Assurance recommendations and clinical pathways of
   care). Connection to Health can work on a variety of input and output
   platforms, and assesses and provides feedback on multiple health
   behaviors and multiple chronic conditions frequently managed in adult
   primary care. As such, it should help to make patient-healthcare team
   encounters more informed and patient-centered. Formative research with
   clinicians indicated that the program addressed a number of practical
   concerns and they appreciated the flexibility and how the Connection to
   Health program could be customized to their office.
   Conclusions: This primary care practice tool based on an implementation
   science model has the potential to guide patients to more healthful
   behaviors and improved self-management of chronic conditions, while
   fostering effective and efficient communication between patients and
   their healthcare team. RE-AIM and similar models can help clinicians and
   media developers create practical products more likely to be widely
   adopted, feasible in busy medical practices, and able to produce public
   health impact.},

Abstract = {Objective: Emotions are key predictors of sexual risk behavior but have
   been largely ignored in theory-based intervention development. The
   present study aims to evaluate whether the addition of an emotional
   education intervention component to a traditional social cognitive safer
   sex intervention increases intervention efficacy, compared with both a
   social cognitive only intervention and a no intervention control
   condition. Methods: Young adults were randomized in small groups to
   receive the social cognitive emotional (SCE) intervention, the social
   cognitive (SC) intervention, or standard of care. Results: Analyses of
   data from 176 participants indicated that intervention arms reported
   similar increased condom use compared with the no intervention control
   arm at 3 months' postintervention (beta = = .41, d = 0.08). However, at
   6 months' postintervention, individuals in the SCE intervention arm
   reported increased condom use compared with both the SC intervention
   (beta = .27, p = .04, d = 0.38) and control arms (beta =.37, p < .01; d
   = 0.56), demonstrating preliminary evidence that the addition of an
   emotional education component may facilitate sustained behavior change.
   Conclusions: An emotional education intervention module has the
   potential to facilitate sustained behavior change at delayed follow-up.
   Additional research is necessary to replicate findings in a larger
   sample and to determine the mediators of emotional education
   intervention efficacy.},

Title = {Collaborative planning approach to inform the implementation of a
   healthcare manager intervention for hispanics with serious mental
   illness: a study protocol},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {Background: This study describes a collaborative planning approach that
   blends principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR) and
   intervention mapping to modify a healthcare manager intervention to a
   new patient population and provider group and to assess the feasibility
   and acceptability of this modified intervention to improve the physical
   health of Hispanics with serious mental illness (SMI) and at risk for
   cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Methods: The proposed study uses a multiphase approach that applies CBPR
   principles and intervention-mapping steps-an intervention-planning
   approach-to move from intervention planning to pilot testing. In phase
   I, a community advisory board composed of researchers and stakeholders
   will be assembled to learn and review the intervention and make initial
   modifications. Phase II uses a combination of qualitative
   methods-patient focus groups and stakeholder interviews-to ensure that
   the modifications are acceptable to all stakeholders. Phase III uses
   results from phase II to further modify the intervention, develop an
   implementation plan, and train two care managers on the modified
   intervention. Phase IV consists of a 12-month open pilot study (N = 30)
   to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the modified intervention
   and explore its initial effects. Lastly, phase V consists of analysis of
   pilot study data and preparation for future funding to develop a more
   rigorous evaluation of the modified intervention.
   Discussion: The proposed study is one of the few projects to date to
   focus on improving the physical health of Hispanics with SMI and at risk
   for CVD by using a collaborative planning approach to enhance the
   transportability and use of a promising healthcare manager intervention.
   This study illustrates how blending health-disparities research and
   implementation science can help reduce the disproportionate burden of
   medical illness in a vulnerable population.},

Abstract = {Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders are highly prevalent
   disorders and are mostly treated in primary care. The management of
   these disorders by general practitioners is not always consistent with
   prevailing guidelines because of a variety of factors. Designing
   implementation strategies tailored to prospectively identified barriers
   could lead to more guideline-recommended care. Although tailoring of
   implementation strategies is promoted in practice, little is known about
   the effect on improving the quality of care for the early recognition,
   diagnosis, and stepped care treatment allocation in patients with
   anxiety or depressive disorders in general practice. This study examines
   whether the tailored strategy supplemented with training and feedback is
   more effective than providing training and feedback alone.
   Methods: In this cluster randomised controlled trial, a total of 22
   general practices will be assigned to one of two conditions: (1)
   training, feedback, and tailored interventions and (2) training and
   feedback. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients who
   have been recognised to have anxiety and/or depressive disorder. The
   secondary outcome measures in patients are severity of anxiety and
   depressive symptoms, level of functioning, expectation towards and
   experience with care, quality of life, and economic costs. Measures are
   taken after the start of the intervention at baseline and at three-and
   six-month follow-ups. Secondary outcome measures in general
   practitioners are adherence to guideline-recommended care in care that
   has been delivered, the proportion of antidepressant prescriptions, and
   number of referrals to specialised mental healthcare facilities. Data
   will be gathered from the electronic medical patient records from the
   patients included in the study. In a process evaluation, the
   identification of barriers to change and the relations between
   prospectively identified barriers and improvement interventions selected
   for use will be described, as well as the factors that influence the
   provision of guideline-recommended care.
   Discussion: It is hypothesised that the adherence to guideline
   recommendations will be improved by designing implementation
   interventions that are tailored to prospectively identified barriers in
   the local context of general practitioners. Currently, there is
   insufficient evidence on the most effective and efficient approaches to
   tailoring, including how barriers should be identified and how
   interventions should be selected to address the barriers.},

Title = {The Long-Term Efficacy of Two Computer-Tailored Physical Activity
   Interventions for Older Adults: Main Effects and Mediators},

Abstract = {Objective: Low-cost (e.g., computer-tailored) interventions with
   sustained effects are needed to increase and maintain physical activity
   in older adults. This study examined the long-term efficacy of 2
   computer-tailored physical activity interventions for older adults and
   its psychosocial and environmental mediators. Methods: A clustered
   randomized controlled trial (N = 1,971) was conducted that included 3
   research arms: (a) basic computer-tailored print intervention, targeting
   psychosocial mediators; (b) environmentally computer-tailored print
   intervention, targeting psychosocial and environmental mediators; and
   (c) no-intervention control group. Interventions were developed using
   the intervention mapping approach and consisted of 3 computer-tailored
   letters delivered over 4 months. Questionnaires assessed the study
   outcomes (i.e., total weekly days and total weekly minutes of physical
   activity) at baseline and 12 months. Potential mediators (i.e.,
   awareness, attitude, self-efficacy, intention, social influence,
   intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and perceived environment) were
   assessed at baseline and at 3 or 6 months. Results: Multilevel
   regression analyses revealed that both interventions significantly
   changed total weekly days of physical activity compared with the control
   group, but only the environmentally computer-tailored print intervention
   significantly changed weekly minutes of physical activity. Multiple
   mediation models showed that the effects of both interventions on weekly
   days of physical activity were mediated by changes in awareness and
   intention. Conclusions: Computer-tailored interventions were effective
   in inducing long-term behavioral changes in physical activity behavior
   of older adults. Awareness and intention were found to be important
   mediators of changing daily physical activity and should be included in
   future computer-tailored intervention studies.},

   increasing MVPA in underserved adolescents. Twenty-four middle schools
   were matched on school size, percentage minorities, percentage free or
   reduce lunch, and urban or rural setting before randomization. A total
   of 1,563 6th grade students (mean age, 11.3 years, 73\% African
   American, 71\% free or reduced lunch, 55\% female) participated in
   either a 17-week (over one academic year) intervention or comparison
   after-school program. Main Outcome Measure: The primary outcome measure
   was MVPA based on 7-day accelerometry estimates at 2-weeks
   postintervention and an intermediate outcome was MVPA at
   midintervention. Results: At midintervention students in the
   intervention condition engaged in 4.87 greater minutes of MVPA per day
   (95\% CI: 1.18 to 8.57) than control students. Students in intervention
   schools engaged in 9.11 min (95\% CI: 5.73 to 12.48) more of MVPA per
   day than those in control schools during the program time periods;
   indicating a 27 min per week increase in MVPA. No significant effect of
   the ACT intervention was found outside of school times or for MVPA at
   2-weeks postintervention. Conclusions: Motivational and behavioral
   skills programs are effective at increasing MVPA in low-income and
   minority adolescents during program hours, but further research is
   needed to address home barriers to youth MVPA.},

Title = {Strengthening evaluation and implementation by specifying components of
   behaviour change interventions: a study protocol},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Background: The importance of behaviour change in improving health is
   illustrated by the increasing investment by funding bodies in the
   development and evaluation of complex interventions to change
   population, patient, and practitioner behaviours. The development of
   effective interventions is hampered by the absence of a nomenclature to
   specify and report their content. This limits the possibility of
   replicating effective interventions, synthesising evidence, and
   understanding the causal mechanisms underlying behaviour change. In
   contrast, biomedical interventions are precisely specified (e.g., the
   pharmacological `ingredients' of prescribed drugs, their dose and
   frequency of administration). For most complex interventions, the
   precise `ingredients' are unknown; descriptions (e.g., `behavioural
   counseling') can mean different things to different researchers or
   implementers. The lack of a method for specifying complex interventions
   undermines the precision of evidence syntheses of effectiveness, posing
   a problem for secondary, as well as primary, research.
   We aim to develop a reliable method of specifying intervention
   components ('techniques') aimed at changing behaviour.
   Methods/Design: The research will be conducted in three phases. The
   first phase will develop the nomenclature. We will refine a preliminary
   list of techniques and definitions. Using a formal consensus method,
   experts will then define the key attributes of each technique and how it
   relates to, and differs from, others. They will evaluate the techniques
   and their definitions until they achieve an agreed-upon list of clearly
   defined, nonredundant techniques. The second phase will test the
   nomenclature. Trained experts (primary researchers and systematic
   reviewers), equipped with a coding manual and guidance, will use the
   nomenclature to code published descriptions of complex interventions.
   Reliability between experts, over time, and across types of users will
   be assessed. We will assess whether using the nomenclature to write
   intervention descriptions enhances the clarity and replicability of
   interventions. The third phase will develop a web-based users' resource
   of clearly specified and nonredundant techniques, which will aid the
   scientific understanding of, and development of, effective complex
   interventions. Dissemination throughout the project will be through
   stakeholder meetings, targeted multidisciplinary workshops, conference
   presentation, journal publication, and publication in an interactive
   web-based platform (a Wiki).
   Discussion: The development of a reliable method of specifying
   intervention components aimed at changing behaviour will strengthen the
   scientific basis for developing, evaluating, and reporting complex
   interventions. It will improve the precision of evidence syntheses of
   effectiveness, thus enhancing secondary, as well as primary, research.},

Title = {Improving adolescent contraceptive use: Evaluation of a theory-driven
   classroom-based intervention},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH \& MEDICINE},

Volume = {16},

Pages = {141-155},
Abstract = {The aim of the research was to evaluate the impact of intervention
   materials, designed to enhance self-efficacy and anticipated regret, on
   contraceptive behaviour and antecedents of contraceptive use in a sample
   of adolescents. It was hypothesised that materials designed to enhance
   self-efficacy and anticipated regret would lead to improvements in
   outcome measures compared with controls. A 4(intervention
   condition)x3(time) mixed design was used to assess the impact of
   intervention materials. Participants (N=414) were recruited from five
   secondary schools in the north of England. They were assigned to an
   active control group, an anticipated regret (AR) manipulation, a
   self-efficacy (SE) manipulation or both AR and SE manipulations. Outcome
   measures included psychological antecedents of contraceptive behaviour
   change, intentions and behaviour. Multivariate analysis of variance
   (MANOVA) revealed increases across several outcome measures over time
   (F{[}14,287]=8.99, P0.001, p2=0.305) including intentions, but these did
   not differ by condition (F{[}42,852]=1.35, P=0.07, p2=0.062). There was
   evidence that the questionnaires may have caused reactivity in
   participants. Amongst sexually active participants with relatively low
   levels of intention to use contraception at the outset, increases in
   several outcome measures including intention and behaviour were observed
   (F{[}3,35]=10.359, P0.001, p2=0.47). Findings support the potential for
   effective delivery of behaviour change theory-driven interventions in
   classroom settings. The possibility that the questionnaires may have
   acted as a form of intervention contributes to recent discussion of this
   issue in the literature, and the findings also strengthen the case for
   post-decisional and behavioural skills interventions to enhance
   behaviour amongst those already motivated to use contraception.},

Title = {Multiple outcome measures and mixed methods for evaluating the
   effectiveness of theory-based behaviour-change interventions: A case
   study targeting health professionals' adoption of a national suicide
   prevention guideline},

Abstract = {Interest in behaviour-change interventions targeting health
   professionals' adoption of clinical guidelines is growing.
   Recommendations have been made for interventions to have a theoretical
   base, explore the local context and to use mixed and multiple methods of
   evaluation to establish intervention effectiveness. This article
   presents a case study of a behaviour-change intervention delivered to
   community mental health professionals in one Primary Care Trust, aimed
   at raising adherence to a national suicide prevention guideline. A
   discussion of how the theory-base was selected, the local context
   explored, and how the intervention was developed and delivered is
   provided. Time series analysis, mediational analysis and qualitative
   process evaluation were used to evaluate and explore intervention
   effectiveness. The time series analysis revealed that the intervention
   was not effective at increasing adherence to the guideline. The
   mediational analysis indicates that the intervention failed to
   successfully target the key barrier to adoption of the guidance, and the
   qualitative process evaluation identified certain intervention
   components that were well received by the health professionals, and also
   identified weaknesses in the delivery of the intervention. It is
   recommended that future research should seek to further develop the
   evidence-base for linking specific intervention strategies to specific
   behavioural barriers, explore the potential of theories that take into
   account broader social and organisational factors that influence health
   professionals' practice and focus on the process of data synthesis for
   identifying key factors to target with tailored interventions. Multiple
   and mixed evaluation techniques are recommended not only to explore
   whether an intervention is effective or not but also why it is effective
   or not.},

Title = {Feasibility of telephone-based cognitive behavioral therapy targeting
   major depression among urban dwelling African-American people with

Abstract = {Given the burden of depression among those with HIV, and the impact of
   HIV on urban minority communities there is an urgent need to assess
   innovative treatment interventions that not only treat depression but do
   so in a way that allows for increased access to mental health care. This
   single site, uncontrolled, pilot study sought to determine the
   feasibility and depression outcomes of an 11-session telephone-based
   cognitive behavioral therapy intervention delivered over 14 weeks
   targeting low-income, urban-dwelling, HIV-infected African-American
   people with major depression. The diagnosis of major depression was made
   using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The primary
   outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the
   secondary outcome was the Quick Inventory of Depression
   Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR). Feasibility and satisfaction were
   also assessed. Assessments occurred at baseline, midpoint and at study
   conclusion (14 weeks). Fifteen people were screened for the study. Six
   HIV-infected, low-income, African-American people individuals (five
   females and one male) were eligible and participated in the study. All
   patients finished the study. On average, participants completed nine
   sessions. The sessions lasted for an average of 48min (SD=11.5).
   Compared to mean HAM-D score at baseline (HAM-D=22.8 (SD=3.1), the mean
   HAM-D score was significantly reduced at study conclusion (HAM-D=9.8
   (SD=7.4); (t (5)=4.6, p=0.006); (Cohen d=1.9)). Compared to the mean
   QIDS-SR score at baseline (QIDS-SR=15.5 (SD=4.2) the mean QIDS score was
   significantly reduced at study conclusion (QIDS=7.0 (SD=5.4);(t (5)=3.2,
   p=0.02); (Cohen d=1.3)).The mean satisfaction scores across all
   participants at post-treatment was 5.7 (SD=0.3) with of a maximum score
   of 6. Telephone-based CBT can be delivered to low-income, urban-dwelling
   ethnic minority HIV-infected people resulting in significant reductions
   in depression symptoms with high satisfaction. The efficacy of this
   intervention will be assessed in a planned randomized control trial.},

   risk-reduction intervention that served as the control. Interventions
   were based on social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behaviour
   and qualitative data from the target population. Data collectors, blind
   to participants' intervention, administered confidential assessments at
   baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months post-intervention. Primary outcomes were
   fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity. Participants were
   1057 grade 6 learners (mean age = 12.4 years), with 96.7\% retained at
   12-month follow-up. Generalised estimating equations revealed that
   averaged over the follow-ups, a greater percentage of health-promotion
   intervention participants than HIV/STD control participants met 5-a-Day
   fruit and vegetable and physical activity guidelines. The intervention
   also increased health-promotion knowledge, attitude and intention, but
   did not decrease substance use or substance-use attitude and intention.
   The findings suggest that theory based and contextually appropriate
   interventions may increase health behaviours among young adolescents in
   sub-Saharan Africa.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of the Positive Action (PA) programme in
   Chicago Public Schools on problem behaviours among a cohort of
   elementary school students from grade three through grade five. Using a
   matched-pair, randomised control design with 14 elementary schools,
   approximately 510 fifth-graders self-reported lifetime substance use,
   serious violence-related behaviour, and current bullying and disruptive
   behaviours. Three-level (i.e. students nested within schools within
   school pairs) overdispersed Poisson models were used to examine
   programme effects on the number of items endorsed for each of the four
   outcomes. Findings indicated that students in the intervention endorsed
   31\% fewer substance use behaviours (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] =
   0.69), 37\% fewer violence-related behaviours (IRR = 0.63) and 41\%
   fewer bullying behaviours (IRR = 0.59), respectively, compared to
   students in the control schools. Reduction in reported disruptive
   behaviours was of a similar magnitude (27\%, IRR = 0.73), but was not
   statistically significant. These results replicate findings of an
   earlier randomised trial of the PA programme and extend evidence of its
   effectiveness to youth attending large urban school systems.},

Title = {A refined taxonomy of behaviour change techniques to help people change
   their physical activity and healthy eating behaviours: The CALO-RE
   taxonomy},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY \& HEALTH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {1479-1498},
Abstract = {Background: Current reporting of intervention content in published
   research articles and protocols is generally poor, with great diversity
   of terminology, resulting in low replicability. This study aimed to
   extend the scope and improve the reliability of a 26-item taxonomy of
   behaviour change techniques developed by Abraham and Michie {[}Abraham,
   C. and Michie, S. (2008). A taxonomy of behaviour change techniques used
   in interventions. Health Psychology, 27(3), 379-387.] in order to
   optimise the reporting and scientific study of behaviour change
   interventions. Methods: Three UK study centres collaborated in applying
   this existing taxonomy to two systematic reviews of interventions to
   increase physical activity and healthy eating. The taxonomy was refined
   in iterative steps of (1) coding intervention descriptions, and
   assessing inter-rater reliability, (2) identifying gaps and problems
   across study centres and (3) refining the labels and definitions based
   on consensus discussions. Results: Labels and definitions were improved
   for all techniques, conceptual overlap between categories was resolved,
   some categories were split and 14 techniques were added, resulting in a
   40-item taxonomy. Inter-rater reliability, assessed on 50 published
   intervention descriptions, was good (kappa = 0.79). Conclusions: This
   taxonomy can be used to improve the specification of interventions in
   published reports, thus improving replication, implementation and
   evidence syntheses. This will strengthen the scientific study of
   behaviour change and intervention development.},

Title = {A critical synthesis of literature on the promoting action on research
   implementation in health services (PARIHS) framework},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {Background: The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health
   Services framework, or PARIHS, is a conceptual framework that posits
   key, interacting elements that influence successful implementation of
   evidence-based practices. It has been widely cited and used as the basis
   for empirical work; however, there has not yet been a literature review
   to examine how the framework has been used in implementation projects
   and research. The purpose of the present article was to critically
   review and synthesize the literature on PARIHS to understand how it has
   been used and operationalized, and to highlight its strengths and
   limitations.
   Methods: We conducted a qualitative, critical synthesis of peer-reviewed
   PARIHS literature published through March 2009. We synthesized findings
   through a three-step process using semi-structured data abstraction
   tools and group consensus.
   Results: Twenty-four articles met our inclusion criteria: six core
   concept articles from original PARIHS authors, and eighteen empirical
   articles ranging from case reports to quantitative studies. Empirical
   articles generally used PARIHS as an organizing framework for analyses.
   No studies used PARIHS prospectively to design implementation
   strategies, and there was generally a lack of detail about how variables
   were measured or mapped, or how conclusions were derived. Several
   studies used findings to comment on the framework in ways that could
   help refine or validate it. The primary issue identified with the
   framework was a need for greater conceptual clarity regarding the
   definition of sub-elements and the nature of dynamic relationships.
   Strengths identified included its flexibility, intuitive appeal,
   explicit acknowledgement of the outcome of `successful implementation,'
   and a more expansive view of what can and should constitute `evidence.'
   Conclusions: While we found studies reporting empirical support for
   PARIHS, the single greatest need for this and other implementation
   models is rigorous, prospective use of the framework to guide
   implementation projects. There is also need to better explain derived
   findings and how interventions or measures are mapped to specific PARIHS
   elements; greater conceptual discrimination among sub-elements may be
   necessary first. In general, it may be time for the implementation
   science community to develop consensus guidelines for reporting the use
   and usefulness of theoretical frameworks within implementation studies.},

Title = {Embedding effective depression care: using theory for primary care
   organisational and systems change},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {Background: Depression and related disorders represent a significant
   part of general practitioners (GPs) daily work. Implementing the
   evidence about what works for depression care into routine practice
   presents a challenge for researchers and service designers. The emerging
   consensus is that the transfer of efficacious interventions into routine
   practice is strongly linked to how well the interventions are based upon
   theory and take into account the contextual factors of the setting into
   which they are to be transferred. We set out to develop a conceptual
   framework to guide change and the implementation of best practice
   depression care in the primary care setting.
   Methods: We used a mixed method, observational approach to gather data
   about routine depression care in a range of primary care settings via:
   audit of electronic health records; observation of routine clinical
   care; and structured, facilitated whole of organisation meetings. Audit
   data were summarised using simple descriptive statistics. Observational
   data were collected using field notes. Organisational meetings were
   audio taped and transcribed. All the data sets were grouped, by
   organisation, and considered as a whole case. Normalisation Process
   Theory (NPT) was identified as an analytical theory to guide the
   conceptual framework development.
   Results: Five privately owned primary care organisations (general
   practices) and one community health centre took part over the course of
   18 months. We successfully developed a conceptual framework for
   implementing an effective model of depression care based on the four
   constructs of NPT: coherence, which proposes that depression work
   requires the conceptualisation of boundaries of who is depressed and who
   is not depressed and techniques for dealing with diffuseness; cognitive
   participation, which proposes that depression work requires engagement
   with a shared set of techniques that deal with depression as a health
   problem; collective action, which proposes that agreement is reached
   about how care is organised; and reflexive monitoring, which proposes
   that depression work requires agreement about how depression work will
   be monitored at the patient and practice level. We describe how these
   constructs can be used to guide the design and implementation of
   effective depression care in a way that can take account of contextual
   differences.
   Conclusions: Ideas about what is required for an effective model and
   system of depression care in primary care need to be accompanied by
   theoretically informed frameworks that consider how these can be
   implemented. The conceptual framework we have presented can be used to
   guide organisational and system change to develop common language around
   each construct between policy makers, service users, professionals, and
   researchers. This shared understanding across groups is fundamental to
   the effective implementation of change in primary care for depression.},

Title = {Translating research into practice in Leeds and Bradford (TRiPLaB): a
   protocol for a programme of research},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Background: The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) has funded
   nine Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care
   (CLAHRCs). Each CLAHRC is a partnership between higher education
   institutions (HEIs) and the NHS in nine UK regional health economies.
   The CLAHRC for Leeds, York, and Bradford comprises two `research themes'
   and three `implementation themes.' One of these implementation themes is
   Translating Research into Practice in Leeds and Bradford (TRiPLaB).
   TRiPLaB aims to develop, implement, and evaluate methods for inducing
   and sustaining the uptake of research knowledge into practice in order
   to improve the quality of health services for the people of Leeds and
   Bradford.
   Methods: TRiPLaB is built around a three-stage, sequential, approach
   using separate, longitudinal case studies conducted with collaborating
   NHS organisations, TRiPLaB will select robust innovations to implement,
   conduct a theory-informed exploration of the local context using a
   variety of data collection and analytic methods, and synthesise the
   information collected to identify the key factors influencing the uptake
   and adoption of targeted innovations. This synthesis will inform the
   development of tailored, multifaceted, interventions designed to
   increase the translation of research findings into practice. Mixed
   research methods, including time series analysis, quasi-experimental
   comparison, and qualitative process evaluation, will be used to evaluate
   the impact of the implementation strategies deployed.
   Conclusion: TRiPLaB is a theory-informed, systematic, mixed methods
   approach to developing and evaluating tailored implementation strategies
   aimed at increasing the translation of research-based findings into
   practice in one UK health economy. Through active collaboration with its
   local NHS, TRiPLaB aims to improve the quality of health services for
   the people of Leeds and Bradford and to contribute to research knowledge
   regarding the interaction between context and adoption behaviour in
   health services.},

Title = {Unpacking vertical and horizontal integration: childhood
   overweight/obesity programs and planning, a Canadian perspective},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Background: Increasingly, multiple intervention programming is being
   understood and implemented as a key approach to developing public health
   initiatives and strategies. Using socio-ecological and population health
   perspectives, multiple intervention programming approaches are aimed at
   providing coordinated and strategic comprehensive programs operating
   over system levels and across sectors, allowing practitioners and
   decision makers to take advantage of synergistic effects. These
   approaches also require vertical and horizontal (v/h) integration of
   policy and practice in order to be maximally effective.
   Discussion: This paper examines v/h integration of interventions for
   childhood overweight/obesity prevention and reduction from a Canadian
   perspective. It describes the implications of v/h integration for
   childhood overweight and obesity prevention, with examples of
   interventions where v/h integration has been implemented. An application
   of a conceptual framework for structuring v/h integration of an
   overweight/obesity prevention initiative is presented. The paper
   concludes with a discussion of the implications of vertical/horizontal
   integration for policy, research, and practice related to childhood
   overweight and obesity prevention multiple intervention programs.
   Summary: Both v/h integration across sectors and over system levels are
   needed to fully support multiple intervention programs of the complexity
   and scope required by obesity issues. V/h integration requires attention
   to system structures and processes. A conceptual framework is needed to
   support policy alignment, multi-level evaluation, and ongoing
   coordination of people at the front lines of practice. Using such tools
   to achieve integration may enhance sustainability, increase
   effectiveness of prevention and reduction efforts, decrease
   stigmatization, and lead to new ways to relate the environment to people
   and people to the environment for better health for children.},

Title = {Study protocol A randomized trial to evaluate e-learning interventions
   designed to improve learner's performance, satisfaction, and
   self-efficacy with the AGREE II},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Background: Practice guidelines (PGs) are systematically developed
   statements intended to assist in patient, practitioner, and policy
   decisions. The AGREE II is the revised and updated standard tool for
   guideline development, reporting and evaluation. It is comprised of 23
   items and a user's Manual. The AGREE II is ready for use.
   Objectives: To develop, execute, and evaluate the impact of two
   internet-based educational interventions designed to accelerate the
   capacity of stakeholders to use the AGREE II: a multimedia didactic
   tutorial with a virtual coach, and a higher intensity training program
   including both the didactic tutorial and an interactive practice
   exercise component.
   Methods: Participants (clinicians, developers, and policy makers) will
   be randomly assigned to one of three conditions. Condition one, didactic
   tutorial - participants will go through the on-line AGREE II tutorial
   supported by a virtual coach and review of the AGREE II prior to
   appraising the test PG. Condition two, tutorial + practice - following
   the multimedia didactic tutorial with a virtual coach, participants will
   review the on-line AGREE II independently and use it to appraise a
   practice PG. Upon entering their AGREE II score for the practice PG,
   participants will be given immediate feedback on how their score
   compares to expert norms. If their score falls outside a predefined
   range, the participant will receive a series of hints to guide the
   appraisal process. Participants will receive an overall summary of their
   performance appraising the PG compared to expert norms. Condition three,
   control arm - participants will receive a PDF copy of the AGREE II for
   review and to appraise the test PG on-line. All participants will then
   rate one of ten test PGs with the AGREE II. The outcomes of interest are
   learners' performance, satisfaction, self-efficacy, mental effort, and
   time-on-task; comparisons will be made across each of the test groups.
   Discussion: Our research will test innovative educational interventions
   of various intensities and instructional design to promote the adoption
   of AGREE II and to identify those strategies that are most effective for
   training. The results will facilitate international capacity to apply
   the AGREE II accurately and with confidence and to enhance the overall
   guideline enterprise.},

Title = {What work has to be done to implement collaborative care for depression?
   Process evaluation of a trial utilizing the Normalization Process Model},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Background: There is a considerable evidence base for `collaborative
   care' as a method to improve quality of care for depression, but an
   acknowledged gap between efficacy and implementation. This study
   utilises the Normalisation Process Model (NPM) to inform the process of
   implementation of collaborative care in both a future full-scale trial,
   and the wider health economy.
   Methods: Application of the NPM to qualitative data collected in both
   focus groups and one-to-one interviews before and after an exploratory
   randomised controlled trial of a collaborative model of care for
   depression.
   Results: Findings are presented as they relate to the four factors of
   the NPM (interactional workability, relational integration, skill-set
   workability, and contextual integration) and a number of necessary tasks
   are identified. Using the model, it was possible to observe that
   predictions about necessary work to implement collaborative care that
   could be made from analysis of the pre-trial data relating to the four
   different factors of the NPM were indeed borne out in the post-trial
   data. However, additional insights were gained from the post-trial
   interview participants who, unlike those interviewed before the trial,
   had direct experience of a novel intervention. The professional freedom
   enjoyed by more senior mental health workers may work both for and
   against normalisation of collaborative care as those who wish to adopt
   new ways of working have the freedom to change their practice but are
   not obliged to do so.
   Conclusions: The NPM provides a useful structure for both guiding and
   analysing the process by which an intervention is optimized for testing
   in a larger scale trial or for subsequent full-scale implementation.},

Title = {Delivering the WISE (Whole Systems Informing Self-Management Engagement)
   training package in primary care: learning from formative evaluation},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Background: The WISE (Whole System Informing Self-management Engagement)
   approach encompasses creating, finding, and implementing appropriate
   self-care support for people with long-term conditions. A training
   package for primary care to introduce the approach was developed and
   underwent formative evaluation. This entailed exploring the
   acceptability of the WISE approach and its effectiveness in changing
   communication within consultations. The study aimed to refine the
   patient, practitioner, and patient level components of the WISE approach
   and translate the principles of WISE into an operational intervention
   deliverable through National Health Service training methods.
   Methods: Normalisation Process Theory provided a framework for
   development of the intervention. Practices were recruited from an inner
   city Primary Care Trust in NW England. All practice staff were expected
   to attend two afternoon training sessions. The training sessions were
   observed by members of the training team. Post-training audio recordings
   of consultations from each general practitioner and nurse in the
   practices were transcribed and read to provide a narrative overview of
   the incorporation of WISE skills and tools into consultations.
   Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff
   post-training.
   Results: Two practices out of 14 deemed eligible agreed to take part.
   Each practice attended two sessions, although a third session on
   consultation skills training was needed for one practice. Fifty-four
   post-training consultations were recorded from 15 clinicians. Two
   members of staff were interviewed at each practice. Significant elements
   of the training form and methods of delivery fitted contemporary
   practice. There were logistical problems in getting a whole practice to
   attend both sessions, and administrative staff founds some sections
   irrelevant. Clinicians reported problems incorporating some of the tools
   developed for WISE, and this was confirmed in the overview of
   consultations, with limited overt use of WISE tools and missed
   opportunities to address patients' self-management needs.
   Conclusions: The formative evaluation approach and attention to
   normalisation process theory allowed the training team to make
   adjustments to content and delivery and ensure appropriate staff
   attended each session. The content of the course was simplified and
   focussed more clearly on operationalising the WISE approach. The patient
   arm of the approach was strengthened by raising expectations of a change
   in approach to self-care support by their practice.},

Abstract = {To develop effective mass media health campaigns it is important to
   explore the behaviour-change techniques that make campaigns more or less
   effective. This exploratory study observed the behaviour-change
   techniques employed in two current healthy eating television programmes,
   and mapped these techniques onto key theoretical frameworks. Interviews
   were then conducted with six participants who watched the programmes, to
   identify which techniques were perceived to be more and less effective
   and to identify any disjunctures between the behaviour-change techniques
   used in the programmes and factors perceived by the participants to be
   particularly influential upon their healthy eating. The two programmes
   were found to use similar behaviour-change techniques, with a heavy
   reliance on providing general health motivation. Interviews revealed
   that participants perceived several specific barriers to eating
   healthily, felt the need for more specific guidance and emphasised the
   importance of identifying with the role models used in the programmes.
   Recommendations for future mass media health campaigns include the need
   to educate individuals about how to overcome specific barriers that they
   might face when trying to eat a healthy diet and to include a wider
   range of role models to encourage the audience to identify with the
   programme participants.},

Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective: Interventions are increasingly described as theory-based;
   however, the basis for this is often not clear. Advancing behavioral
   science requires a good understanding of how interventions are informed
   by, and test, theory. This study aims to develop a reliable method for
   assessing the extent to which behavioral interventions are theory-based.
   Design: The reliability, usability, and comprehensiveness of an initial
   coding scheme were improved in 13 iterative stages on the basis of its
   application to 29 papers, from a systematic review of interventions to
   promote physical activity and healthy eating. Results: The final Theory
   Coding Scheme contained 19 items, each with satisfactory interrater
   reliabilities, coding whether a theory or model was mentioned, how
   theories were used in intervention design, how intervention evaluations
   tested theory, and the implications of the results for future theory
   development. Conclusion: The Theory Coding Scheme is an important
   methodological innovation, providing a research tool to reliably
   describe the theoretical base of interventions, inform evidence
   syntheses within literature reviews and meta-analyses, and stimulate the
   use of empirical data for theory development.},

Pages = {519-534},
Abstract = {In this pilot study, the effects of two computer-assisted dieting (CAD)
   interventions on weight loss and blood chemistry were examined among
   overweight and obese adults. Participants (91 community members, average
   age 42.6 years) were randomly assigned to CAD-only (a single-session
   introduction and provision of a dieting software, n = 30), CAD plus an
   additional four-session self-management group training (CAD+G, n = 31)
   and a waitlist control group whose members were randomised into the two
   interventions at the 3-month follow-up (n = 30). A three (group)-by-two
   (time) repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant group by time
   interaction during the initial 3-month period. However, the two
   intervention groups combined showed a significant, though moderate
   weight loss relative to the control group. Further, although a general
   improvement was found with regard to the lipid panel results during the
   first 3 months of the trial, the treatment by time interaction was not
   significant. A comparison of the developments in the two intervention
   groups during the 3- to 6-month follow-up time period revealed a
   tendency towards greater weight regain in the CAD-only condition. The
   evidence suggests that CAD supports initial weight loss; however,
   additional self-management training might be necessary to support
   maintenance.},

Title = {A typology of practice narratives during the implementation of a
   preventive, community intervention trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {Background: Traditional methods of process evaluation encompass what
   components were delivered, but rarely uncover how practitioners position
   themselves and act relative to an intervention being tested. This could
   be crucial for expanding our understanding of implementation and its
   contribution to intervention effectiveness.
   Methods: We undertook a narrative analysis of in-depth, unstructured
   field diaries kept by nine community development practitioners for two
   years. The practitioners were responsible for implementing a
   multi-component, preventive, community-level intervention for mothers of
   new babies in eight communities, as part of a cluster randomised
   community intervention trial. We constructed a narrative typology of
   approaches to practice, drawing on the phenomenology of Alfred Schutz
   and Max Weber's Ideal Type theory.
   Results: Five types of practice emerged, from a highly
   `technology-based' type that was faithful to intervention
   specifications, through to a `romantic' type that held relationships to
   be central to daily operations, with intact relationships being the
   final arbiter of intervention success. The five types also differed in
   terms of how others involved in the intervention were characterized, the
   narrative form (e. g., tragedy, satire) and where and how transformative
   change in communities was best created. This meant that different types
   traded-off or managed the priorities of the intervention differently,
   according to the deeply held values of their type.
   Conclusions: The data set constructed for this analysis is unique. It
   revealed that practitioners not only exercise their agency within
   interventions, they do so systematically, that is, according to a
   pattern. The typology is the first of its kind and, if verified through
   replication, may have value for anticipating intervention dynamics and
   explaining implementation variation in community interventions.},

Title = {Study protocol for a group randomized controlled trial of a
   classroom-based intervention aimed at preventing early risk factors for
   drug abuse: integrating effectiveness and implementation research},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Background: While a number of preventive interventions delivered within
   schools have shown both short-term and long-term impact in
   epidemiologically based randomized field trials, programs are not often
   sustained with high-quality implementation over time. This study was
   designed to support two purposes. The first purpose was to test the
   effectiveness of a universal classroom-based intervention, the Whole Day
   First Grade Program (WD), aimed at two early antecedents to drug abuse
   and other problem behaviors, namely, aggressive, disruptive behavior and
   poor academic achievement. The second purpose-the focus of this
   paper-was to examine the utility of a multilevel structure to support
   high levels of implementation during the effectiveness trial, to sustain
   WD practices across additional years, and to train additional teachers
   in WD practices.
   Methods: The WD intervention integrated three components, each
   previously tested separately: classroom behavior management;
   instruction, specifically reading; and family-classroom partnerships
   around behavior and learning. Teachers and students in 12 schools were
   randomly assigned to receive either the WD intervention or the standard
   first-grade program of the school system (SC). Three consecutive cohorts
   of first graders were randomized within schools to WD or SC classrooms
   and followed through the end of third grade to test the effectiveness of
   the WD intervention. Teacher practices were assessed over three years to
   examine the utility of the multilevel structure to support
   sustainability and scaling-up.
   Discussion: The design employed in this trial appears to have
   considerable utility to provide data on WD effectiveness and to inform
   the field with regard to structures required to move evidence-based
   programs into practice.},

Title = {Fostering implementation of health services research findings into
   practice: a consolidated framework for advancing implementation science},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {Background: Many interventions found to be effective in health services
   research studies fail to translate into meaningful patient care outcomes
   across multiple contexts. Health services researchers recognize the need
   to evaluate not only summative outcomes but also formative outcomes to
   assess the extent to which implementation is effective in a specific
   setting, prolongs sustainability, and promotes dissemination into other
   settings. Many implementation theories have been published to help
   promote effective implementation. However, they overlap considerably in
   the constructs included in individual theories, and a comparison of
   theories reveals that each is missing important constructs included in
   other theories. In addition, terminology and definitions are not
   consistent across theories. We describe the Consolidated Framework For
   Implementation Research (CFIR) that offers an overarching typology to
   promote implementation theory development and verification about what
   works where and why across multiple contexts.
   Methods: We used a snowball sampling approach to identify published
   theories that were evaluated to identify constructs based on strength of
   conceptual or empirical support for influence on implementation,
   consistency in definitions, alignment with our own findings, and
   potential for measurement. We combined constructs across published
   theories that had different labels but were redundant or overlapping in
   definition, and we parsed apart constructs that conflated underlying
   concepts.
   Results: The CFIR is composed of five major domains: intervention
   characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of the
   individuals involved, and the process of implementation. Eight
   constructs were identified related to the intervention (e.g., evidence
   strength and quality), four constructs were identified related to outer
   setting (e.g., patient needs and resources), 12 constructs were
   identified related to inner setting (e.g., culture, leadership
   engagement), five constructs were identified related to individual
   characteristics, and eight constructs were identified related to process
   (e.g., plan, evaluate, and reflect). We present explicit definitions for
   each construct.
   Conclusion: The CFIR provides a pragmatic structure for approaching
   complex, interacting, multi-level, and transient states of constructs in
   the real world by embracing, consolidating, and unifying key constructs
   from published implementation theories. It can be used to guide
   formative evaluations and build the implementation knowledge base across
   multiple studies and settings.},

Abstract = {Complex behaviour change interventions are not well described; when they
   are described, the terminology used is inconsistent. This constrains
   scientific replication, and limits the subsequent introduction of
   successful interventions. Implementation Science is introducing a policy
   of initially encouraging and subsequently requiring the scientific
   reporting of complex behaviour change interventions.},

   Process Theory},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Background: Theories are important tools in the social and natural
   sciences. The methods by which they are derived are rarely described and
   discussed. Normalization Process Theory explains how new technologies,
   ways of acting, and ways of working become routinely embedded in
   everyday practice, and has applications in the study of implementation
   processes. This paper describes the process by which it was built.
   Methods: Between 1998 and 2008, we developed a theory. We derived a set
   of empirical generalizations from analysis of data collected in
   qualitative studies of healthcare work and organization. We developed an
   applied theoretical model through analysis of empirical generalizations.
   Finally, we built a formal theory through a process of extension and
   implication analysis of the applied theoretical model.
   Results: Each phase of theory development showed that the constructs of
   the theory did not conflict with each other, had explanatory power, and
   possessed sufficient robustness for formal testing. As the theory
   developed, its scope expanded from a set of observed regularities in
   data with procedural explanations, to an applied theoretical model, to a
   formal middle-range theory.
   Conclusion: Normalization Process Theory has been developed through
   procedures that were properly sceptical and critical, and which were
   opened to review at each stage of development. The theory has been shown
   to merit formal testing.},

Abstract = {This article reports the development and exploratory testing of a
   school-based intervention programme designed to enhance levels of
   physical activity in adolescents. The intervention is based on social
   cognitive theory (SCT), self-regulation theory (SRT) and planning as
   evidence-based mediators of physical activity changes. Two classes,
   paired on socio-economic variables, were selected from each of eight
   Portuguese schools and randomly assigned to an intervention or control
   group (N = 291). Primary outcome was `moderate to vigorous physical
   activity' (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) measured pre
   and post intervention and at three and nine months follow-up. SCT, SRT
   and planning variables were secondary outcomes measured pre and post
   intervention. At post test, participants in the intervention group
   reported 18 min per week more physical activity (PA), adjusted for
   pre-intervention, age and sex, than those in the control group (95\%
   confidence interval - 10 to 46; p = 0.249). This difference increased to
   33 min (95\% CI - 4 to 71; p = 0.082) at three months and to 57 min
   (95\% CI 13 to 101, p = 0.008) at nine month follow-up. Moreover, the
   intervention resulted in changes of some of the theoretical target
   variables, including outcome expectancies and coping planning. However,
   no evidence was found for the changes in theoretical moderators to
   mediate the intervention effects on behaviour. Implications for theory
   and for future research are discussed.},

Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY \& HEALTH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {529-544},
Abstract = {The reported study compared the efficacy of three self-affirmation
   manipulations in reducing defensive processing and instigating behaviour
   change in response to personally relevant information about the health
   risks of sunbathing. White female sunbathers (N = 162) were recruited on
   a beach in the south of England. Participants were randomly allocated to
   a `values affirmation' condition, a `kindness affirmation' condition, a
   `positive traits affirmation' condition, or a no affirmation `control'
   condition. In the `positive traits affirmation' condition the
   self-affirmation task was incorporated into a leaflet presenting the
   health risk information. Findings supported the hypothesis that
   participants in the three self-affirmation conditions would engage in
   less-defensive processing of the health-risk information than those in
   the `control' condition. For the behavioural measure, however, only
   those participants in the `positive traits affirmation' condition were
   more likely to request a free sample of sunscreen than those in the
   control condition. The implications of these findings for
   self-affirmation theory and the development of effective health
   promotion campaigns are discussed.},

Title = {Feasibility and effectiveness of a brief meditation-based stress
   management intervention for patients diagnosed with or at risk for
   coronary heart disease: A pilot study},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {513-523},
Abstract = {Extensive research has led to the development of a psychobiological
   model of cardiovascular disease. This model suggests that psychological
   factors such as depression, anxiety, hostility, and stress may affect
   the development and progression of coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent
   studies have also demonstrated that meditation-based stress reduction
   programs are useful interventions for patients with various medical and
   psychological symptoms. The objective of this pilot study was to gather
   preliminary information regarding the feasibility of implementing a
   brief meditation-based stress management (MBSM) program for patients
   with CHD, and those at high risk for CHD, at a major metropolitan
   hospital that serves a predominately non-local patient population. The
   secondary aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that such
   an intervention might reduce depression, as well as perceived stress,
   anxiety, and hostility, while improving general health scores. The
   overall feasibility results indicate that this MBSM intervention was
   highly feasible with regard to both recruitment and retention of
   participants. In fact, 40\% of patients requested further training. In
   addition, after completion of the 4-week intervention, participants
   reported significant reductions in depression and perceived stress. In
   conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the brief
   meditation-based stress management program was well-received by patients
   and can successfully be used as a supportive program for patients at
   risk or diagnosed with CHD.},

Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY \& HEALTH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-9},
Abstract = {The development of theory- and evidence-based health education
   interventions is a complex process in which interventionists in
   collaboration with priority groups and stakeholders make many decisions
   about objectives, change techniques, intervention materials and
   activities, delivery modes and implementation issues. In this
   development process, interventionists have to find a balance between
   employing change techniques that should be effective in an ideal world,
   and intervention activities and materials that match the reality of
   priority populations and intervention contexts. Intervention
   descriptions providing information about what behaviour change
   techniques have been employed, do not reflect the complexity of this
   decision-making process. They do not reveal why interventionists have
   decided to include or exclude particular behaviour change techniques.
   They do not reveal that interventions are based not only upon
   considerations of health psychologists and other scientists, but also on
   practical and political boundaries and opportunities that set the scene
   for the effectiveness of change techniques. Intervention descriptions
   should therefore reveal not only what is included in the interventions,
   but also why the intervention is as it is. Intervention Mapping provides
   the tools that enable the production of such descriptions.},

Abstract = {Most longitudinal, correlational studies on health-behaviour change
   examine effects of Time1 social-cognitive predictors on subsequent
   behaviour. In contrast, our research focusses on associations between
   changes in predictors with change in behaviour. The Health Action
   Process Approach (HAPA) distinguishes between motivational predictors
   for intention formation and volitional predictors for behavioural change
   and served as theoretical basis. Two online-studies were launched
   targeting different behaviours (low-fat diet, smoking), different
   samples (Study 1: N = 469; Study 2: N = 441) and different time spans
   (Study 1: 3 months, Study 2: 4 weeks). Data were analysed by means of
   structural equation modelling with latent difference scores. Both
   studies resulted in almost parallel prediction patterns. Change in risk
   awareness and change in outcome expectancies did not result in change in
   intentions, whereas change in self-efficacy was of crucial importance.
   Change in behaviour was associated with change in action planning and
   action control over and above the effects of intentions. In one study,
   increases in self-efficacy yielded increases in behaviour change.
   Results demonstrate that change in action planning and especially action
   control was of great importance for behaviour change across two
   different behaviours. Analysing change in social-cognitive predictors
   allows drawing precise conclusions for interventions.},

Abstract = {Recognition that informal cancer carers experience unmet needs and
   psychological distress has led to the development of a range of
   psycho-social interventions. The efficacy of such interventions is
   examined through a systematic review of the research literature,
   following National Health and Medical Research Council and Cochrane
   Collaboration guidelines. Of 13 level II randomised controlled trials
   (RCTs), only eight showed significant differences across groups, with
   moderate effect size. This included improvement in caregiver experience
   or appraisal of caregiving following psycho-education (two studies);
   improved sexual satisfaction, dyadic coping, relationship quality and
   communication, or reduced psychological distress, following couple
   counselling (4); reduced distress following family grief therapy (1);
   and reduction in distress in bereavement following home palliative care
   (1). Level III and IV studies were also reviewed, reporting positive
   effects of psycho-education (5), problem solving (3), an arts
   intervention (1) and a support group (1). However, methodological
   concerns limit the generalisability of findings of level III and IV
   studies. It is concluded that interventions should target those most in
   need of support; recognise specific needs of carers across cancer type
   and stage, gender and relationship context; be theory based; and
   evaluations should utilise RCT designs with outcome measures appropriate
   to the specific aims of the intervention, rather than global measures of
   distress.},

Abstract = {Objective: To see whether the stages of change are Useful for targeting
   it brief intervention to reduce smoking based on implementation
   intentions'. A second objective was to rule out demand characteristics
   as an alternative explanation for the findings of intervention Studies
   based on the transtheoretical model and implementation intentions.
   Design: Participants (N = 350) were randomized to a passive control
   condition (questionnaire only). active control condition (questionnaire
   plus instruction to plan to quit), of experimental condition
   (questionnaire, plan to quit. form fit implementation intention). Their
   behavior and psychosocial orientation to quit Were measured at baseline
   and at 2-month follow-up. Main Outcome Measures: Theory of planned
   behavior variables, nicotine dependence, and quitting. Results:
   Significantly more People quit smoking in the experimental condition
   that) in the control conditions, and the planning, instructions changed
   intention to quit and perceived control over quitting. but not behavior.
   Stage of change moderated these effects such that implementation
   intentions worked best for individuals who were in the preparation stage
   at baseline, Conclusion: Harnessing both motivational and volitional
   processes seems to enhance the effectiveness of smoking cessation
   programs, although further work is required to clarify inconsistencies

Abstract = {Objective: TO evaluate the impact of a classroom-based. Web-assisted
   tobacco intervention addressing smoking Prevention and cessation with
   adolescents. Design: A two-group randomized control trial with 1.402
   male and female students in grades 9 through 11 from 14 secondary
   schools in Toronto, Canada. Participants were randomly assigned to a
   tailored Web-assisted tobacco intervention or an interactive control
   condition task conducted during a single classroom session with e-mail
   follow-up. The cornerstone of the intervention was a five-stage
   interactive Web site called the Smoking Zine
   (http://www.smokingzine.org) integrated into a program that included a
   paper-based journal, a small group form of motivational interviewing.
   and tailored e-mails. Main Outcome Measure: Resistance to smoking,
   behavioral intentions to smoke, and cigarette use were assessed at
   baseline, postintervention, and three- and six-month follow-up.
   Multilevel logistic growth modeling was used to assess the effect Of the
   intervention Oil Change over time. Results: The integrated Smoking Zine
   program helped smokers significantly reduce the likelihood of having
   high intentions to smoke and increased their likelihood of high
   resistance to continued cigarette use at 6 months. The intervention also
   significantly reduced die likelihood of heavy cigarette use adoption by
   nonsmokers during the study period. Conclusion: The Smoking Zine
   intervention provided cessation motivation for smokers most resistant to
   quitting at baseline and prevented nonsmoking adolescents from becoming
   heavy smokers at 6 months. By providing an accessible and attractive
   method of engaging Young People if) smoking, prevention and cessation,
   this interactive and integrated program provides a novel vehicle for
   school- and population-level health promotion.},

Title = {EQUIP: Implementing chronic care principles and applying formative
   evaluation methods to improve care for schizophrenia: QUERI Series},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {3},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Background: This paper presents a case study that demonstrates the
   evolution of a project entitled ``Enhancing Quality of care In
   Psychosis{''} (EQUIP) that began approximately when the U. S. Department
   of Veterans Affairs' Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI),
   and implementation science were emerging. EQUIP developed methods and
   tools to implement chronic illness care principles in the treatment of
   schizophrenia, and evaluated this implementation using a small-scale
   controlled trial. The next iteration of the project, EQUIP-2, was
   further informed by implementation science and the use of QUERI tools.
   Methods: This paper reports the background, development, results and
   implications of EQUIP, and also describes ongoing work in the second
   phase of the project (EQUIP-2). The EQUIP intervention uses
   implementation strategies and tools to increase the adoption and
   implementation of chronic illness care principles. In EQUIP-2, these
   strategies and tools are conceptually grounded in a stages-of-change
   model, and include clinical and delivery system interventions and
   adoption/ implementation tools. Formative evaluation occurs in
   conjunction with the intervention, and includes developmental,
   progress-focused, implementation-focused, and interpretive evaluation.
   Results: Evaluation of EQUIP provided an understanding of quality gaps
   and how to address related problems in schizophrenia. EQUIP showed that
   solutions to quality problems in schizophrenia differ by treatment
   domain and are exacerbated by a lack of awareness of evidence-based
   practices. EQUIP also showed that improving care requires creating
   resources for physicians to help them easily implement practice changes,
   plus intensive education as well as product champions who help
   physicians use these resources. Organizational changes, such as the
   addition of care managers and informatics systems, were shown to help
   physicians with identifying problems, making referrals, and monitoring
   follow-up. In EQUIP-2, which is currently in progress, these initial
   findings were used to develop a more comprehensive approach to
   implementing and evaluating the chronic illness care model.
   Discussion: In QUERI, small-scale projects contribute to the development
   and enhancement of hands-on, action-oriented service-directed projects
   that are grounded in current implementation science. This project
   supports the concept that QUERI tools can be useful in implementing
   complex care models oriented toward evidence-based improvement of
   clinical care.},

Title = {Evaluating the successful implementation of evidence into practice using
   the PARiHS framework: theoretical and practical challenges},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Background: The PARiHS framework (Promoting Action on Research
   Implementation in Health Services) has proved to be a useful practical
   and conceptual heuristic for many researchers and practitioners in
   framing their research or knowledge translation endeavours. However, as
   a conceptual framework it still remains untested and therefore its
   contribution to the overall development and testing of theory in the
   field of implementation science is largely unquantified.
   Discussion: This being the case, the paper provides an integrated
   summary of our conceptual and theoretical thinking so far and introduces
   a typology (derived from social policy analysis) used to distinguish
   between the terms conceptual framework, theory and model - important
   definitional and conceptual issues in trying to refine theoretical and
   methodological approaches to knowledge translation.
   Secondly, the paper describes the next phase of our work, in particular
   concentrating on the conceptual thinking and mapping that has led to the
   generation of the hypothesis that the PARiHS framework is best utilised
   as a two-stage process: as a preliminary (diagnostic and evaluative)
   measure of the elements and sub-elements of evidence (E) and context
   (C), and then using the aggregated data from these measures to determine
   the most appropriate facilitation method. The exact nature of the
   intervention is thus determined by the specific actors in the specific
   context at a specific time and place.
   In the process of refining this next phase of our work, we have had to
   consider the wider issues around the use of theories to inform and shape
   our research activity; the ongoing challenges of developing robust and
   sensitive measures; facilitation as an intervention for getting research
   into practice; and finally to note how the current debates around
   evidence into practice are adopting wider notions that fit innovations
   more generally.
   Summary: The paper concludes by suggesting that the future direction of
   the work on the PARiHS framework is to develop a two-stage diagnostic
   and evaluative approach, where the intervention is shaped and moulded by
   the information gathered about the specific situation and from
   participating stakeholders. In order to expedite the generation of new
   evidence and testing of emerging theories, we suggest the formation of
   an international research implementation science collaborative that can
   systematically collect and analyse experiences of using and testing the
   PARiHS framework and similar conceptual and theoretical approaches.
   We also recommend further refinement of the definitions around
   conceptual framework, theory, and model, suggesting a wider discussion
   that embraces multiple epistemological and ontological perspectives.},

Abstract = {Developing more effective behavioural interventions requires an
   understanding of the mechanisms of behaviour change, and methods to
   rigorously test their theoretical basis. The delivery and theoretical
   basis of an intervention protocol were assessed in ProActive, a UK trial
   of an intervention to increase the physical activity of those at risk of
   Type 2 diabetes (N = 365). In 108 intervention sessions, behaviours of
   facilitators were mapped to four theories that informed intervention
   development and behaviours of participants were mapped to 17 theoretical
   components of these four theories. The theory base of the intervention
   specified by the protocol was different than that delivered by
   facilitators, and that received by participants. Of the intervention
   techniques delivered, 25\% were associated with theory of planned
   behaviour (TPB), 42\% with self-regulation theory (SRT), 24\% with
   operant learning theory (OLT) and 9\% with relapse prevention theory
   (RPT). The theoretical classification of participant talk showed a
   different pattern, with twice the proportion associated with OLT (48\%),
   21\% associated with TPB, 31\% with SRT and no talk associated with RPT.
   This study demonstrates one approach to assessing the extent to which
   the theories used to guide intervention development account for any
   changes observed.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Examine the effectiveness of an intervention to increase
   fruits and vegetables (FV) consumption among smokers. Design:
   Cluster-randomized trial of 20 public housing developments; 10 randomly
   assigned to an FV intervention and 10 to a smoking cessation
   intervention. Main outcome measures: Usual (past 7 days) and past 30
   days change in daily FV intake at 8 weeks and 6 months postbaseline.
   Results: Greater increases were seen in the FV group. At Week 8 and
   Month 6, the FV group had consumed 1.58 (p <.001) and 0.78 (p =.04),
   respectively, more daily FV servings in the past 7 days than the
   cessation group. At the same time points, the FV group had consumed 3.61
   (p =.01) and 3.93 (p =.01), respectively, more FV servings in the past
   30 days than the cessation group. Completing more motivational
   interviewing sessions (p =.02) and trying more recipes (p =.02) led to
   significantly greater increases at Month 6 among FV participants.
   Conclusions: Motivational interviewing counseling and lifestyle
   modification through trying out healthy recipes may be effective in
   helping a high-fisk population increase their FV intake.},

Title = {A conceptual framework for implementation fidelity},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {Background: Implementation fidelity refers to the degree to which an
   intervention or programme is delivered as intended. Only by
   understanding and measuring whether an intervention has been implemented
   with fidelity can researchers and practitioners gain a better
   understanding of how and why an intervention works, and the extent to
   which outcomes can be improved.
   Discussion: The authors undertook a critical review of existing
   conceptualisations of implementation fidelity and developed a new
   conceptual framework for understanding and measuring the process. The
   resulting theoretical framework requires testing by empirical research.
   Summary: Implementation fidelity is an important source of variation
   affecting the credibility and utility of research. The conceptual
   framework presented here offers a means for measuring this variable and
   understanding its place in the process of intervention implementation.},

   theory, but evidence of effectiveness in practice is needed},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {1},
Abstract = {The Improved Clinical Effectiveness through Behavioural Research Group
   (ICEBeRG) authors assert that a key weakness in implementation research
   is the unknown applicability of a given intervention outside its
   original site and problem, and suggest that use of explicit theory
   offers an effective solution. This assertion is problematic for three
   primary reasons. First, the presence of an underlying theory does not
   necessarily ease the task of judging the applicability of a piece of
   empirical evidence. Second, it is not clear how to translate theory
   reliably into intervention design, which undoubtedly involves the
   diluting effect of ``common sense.{''} Thirdly, there are many theories,
   formal and informal, and it is not clear why any one should be given
   primacy. To determine whether explicitly theory-based interventions are,
   on average, more effective than those based on implicit theories,
   pragmatic trials are needed. Until empirical evidence is available
   showing the superiority of theory-based interventions, the use of theory
   should not be used as a basis for assessing the value of implementation
   studies by research funders, ethics committees, editors or policy
   decision makers.},

Title = {Role of ``external facilitation{''} in implementation of research
   findings: a qualitative evaluation of facilitation experiences in the
   Veterans Health Administration},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {1},
Abstract = {Background: Facilitation has been identified in the literature as a
   potentially key component of successful implementation. It has not,
   however, either been well-defined or well-studied. Significant questions
   remain about the operational definition of facilitation and about the
   relationship of facilitation to other interventions, especially to other
   change agent roles when used in multi-faceted implementation projects.
   Researchers who are part of the Quality Enhancement Research Initiative
   (QUERI) are actively exploring various approaches and processes,
   including facilitation, to enable implementation of best practices in
   the Veterans Health Administration health care system - the largest
   integrated healthcare system in the United States. This paper describes
   a systematic, retrospective evaluation of implementation-related
   facilitation experiences within QUERI, a quality improvement program
   developed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs.
   Methods: A post-hoc evaluation was conducted through a series of
   semi-structured interviews to examine the concept of facilitation across
   several multi-site QUERI implementation studies. The interview process
   is based on a technique developed in the field of education, which
   systematically enhances learning through experience by stimulating
   recall and reflection regarding past complex activities. An iterative
   content analysis approach relative to a set of conceptually-based
   interview questions was used for data analysis.
   Findings: Findings suggest that facilitation, within an implementation
   study initiated by a central change agency, is a deliberate and valued
   process of interactive problem solving and support that occurs in the
   context of a recognized need for improvement and a supportive
   interpersonal relationship. Facilitation was described primarily as a
   distinct role with a number of potentially crucial behaviors and
   activities. Data further suggest that external facilitators were likely
   to use or integrate other implementation interventions, while performing
   this problem-solving and supportive role.
   Preliminary Conclusions: This evaluation provides evidence to suggest
   that facilitation could be considered a distinct implementation
   intervention, just as audit and feedback, educational outreach, or
   similar methods are considered to be discrete interventions. As such,
   facilitation should be well-defined and explicitly evaluated for its
   perceived usefulness within multi-intervention implementation projects.
   Additionally, researchers should better define the specific contribution
   of facilitation to the success of implementation in different types of
   projects, different types of sites, and with evidence and innovations of
   varying levels of strength and complexity.},

Abstract = {Intervention strategies that can produce successful rates of long-term
   behavior change have proven elusive and indicate the need for new
   approaches to this vexing problem. However, the development of new
   intervention strategies is constrained by our current conceptualization
   of behavioral maintenance. This article reviews how the dominant models
   of health behavior change have operationalized the psychological
   processes that guide the initiation and maintenance of a new pattern of
   behavior. In Light of this review, an alternative framework is proposed
   based on the premise that the decision criteria that lead people to
   initiate a change in their behavior are different from those that lead
   them to maintain that behavior. Decisions regarding behavioral
   initiation are predicted to depend on favorable expectations regarding
   future outcomes, whereas decisions regarding behavioral maintenance are
   predicted To depend on perceived satisfaction with received outcomes.
   The implications of this framework for behavioral interventions are
   addressed.},

Abstract = {Tailoring information to a target individual's features is a promising
   line of development in self-help interventions. In this article, 752
   smokers with explicit low intention to quit were randomly assigned to 1
   of 5 conditions: (a) multiple tailored letters with self-help guide, (b)
   multiple tailored letters only, (c) a single tailored letter with a
   self-help guide, (d) a single tailored letter only, or (e) a nontailored
   intervention. Follow-up assessment took place 4 months after the
   intervention. Results indicated that the single tailored intervention
   only had no surplus value compared with a nontailored look-alike
   intervention. The addition of a self-help guide to a tailored
   intervention was only useful in highly dependent smokers, and multiple
   tailoring was more effective than single tailoring. It remains important
   to elucidate why and for whom certain tailored interventions are more
   effective.},

Abstract = {In this study, methods of decreasing highly preferred sedentary
   behaviors were compared and the consequent effects on activity choice
   were examined. Following free choice of sedentary and physical
   activities, 34 obese children either were positively reinforced for
   decreases in high-preference sedentary activity, were punished for
   high-preference sedentary activity, had access to high-preference
   sedentary activity restricted, or had no contingencies on activity
   (control group). Children randomized to reinforcement and punishment
   were more physically active on intervention days than the control group.
   Liking for targeted sedentary activity decreased in the reinforcement
   group, but increased in the restriction and control groups. Results
   suggest that reinforcing decreases in high-preference sedentary activity
   can increase physical activity and decrease liking for targeted
   sedentary activities.},

Title = {Preventing alcohol abuse and alcohol-related problems through community
   interventions: A review of evaluation studies},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY \& HEALTH},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-131},
Abstract = {In recent years community-based initiatives have emerged as the most
   widely heralded and promoted alcohol and drug abuse prevention strategy
   in the USA. In this paper we critically review those studies (n = 8)
   that have presented data designed to assess the effectiveness of
   community-based alcohol abuse prevention programs. The majority of these
   studies report minimal program effects, even over the immediate
   post-intervention period. Their principal limitations appear to be (1) a
   failure to generate community involvement in the design and
   implementation of program activities and (2) an inability to impact upon
   community-level processes. Three studies recently initiated in the USA
   are then discussed. These address more directly than previous efforts
   the issue of whether change in systems-level influences can be achieved
   through community-based interventions, while also attempting to broaden
   the target audience of intervention programs and encouraged greater
   community participation. Among the numerous challenges that remain in
   the area of alcohol abuse prevention research is to develop and
   implement community-based programs in ``high risk{''} urban settings,
   where the markets for alcohol and other drugs tend to concentrate due to
   economic conditions.},

Abstract = {Behavioral change reduces risk of HIV infection and development of AIDS.
   We compared 206 inner-city women who were randomly assigned to a
   4-session AIDS-prevention group or to one of two controls, a
   health-promotion group or a no-intervention group. AIDS-prevention and
   health-promotion groups provided information, behavioral competency
   training, and social support. Only the AIDS-prevention group focused on
   AIDS-specific knowledge and skills. The AIDS-prevention group produced
   moderate, consistent increases in knowledge and safer sex behaviors in
   comparison with either the health-promotion or no-intervention group.
   Self-report and objective changes were sustained 6 months after
   intervention for both African-American and European-American women.},

Title = {EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS ON NECK, SHOULDER AND

Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY \& HEALTH},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Pages = {371-382},
Abstract = {One hundred and eleven females volunteered to take part in this
   intervention study of musculoskeletal pain. They all completed a survey
   of pain among five hundred and eighty-six female hospital staff and
   presented mild to severe pain in the neck, shoulder and/or low back.
   They were randomly assigned to one of the following groups; Focus on
   job-stress and psychosocial coping (Cognitive), relaxation training
   (Relaxation), the combination of the two (Combined) or to a control
   group (Control). Musculoskeletal pain (intensity and duration) was
   assessed by self-report prior to interventions, immediately after
   interventions, and at a four months follow-up. Results from multivariate
   analyses of variance as well as covariance (pre-intervention levels of
   pain as covariate) showed that magnitude of pain reduction was dependent
   upon the interaction between area of the back and type of intervention.
   These trends were more significant for intensity than for duration
   scores. They were due to reductions of pain in (1) neck and shoulders
   for the Cognitive and Combined groups and (2) in the low back and
   shoulders for the Relaxation group. The four month follow-up assessment
   revealed a significant risk of relapse only for duration of low back
   pain among subjects in the Combined group. Results from the Cognitive
   approach to intervention may reflect a causal role for ability to cope
   with psychosocial job stress in the development of neck and shoulder
   pain in female hospital staff.},
