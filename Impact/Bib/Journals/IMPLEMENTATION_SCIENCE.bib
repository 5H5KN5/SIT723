Abstract = {Background The Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model
   (PRISM) was developed in 2008 as a contextually expanded version of the
   broadly used Reach, Adoption, Effectiveness, Implementation, and
   Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. PRISM provides researchers a pragmatic
   and intuitive model to improve translation of research interventions
   into clinical and community practice. Since 2008, the use of PRISM
   increased across diverse topics, populations, and settings. This
   citation analysis and scoping systematic review aimed to assess the use
   of the PRISM framework and to make recommendations for future research.
   Methods A literature search was conducted using three databases (PubMed,
   Web of Science, Scopus) for the period of 2008 and September 2020. After
   exclusion, reverse citation searches and invitations to experts in the
   field were used to identify and obtain recommendations for additional
   articles not identified in the original search. Studies that integrated
   PRISM into their study design were selected for full abstraction. Unique
   research studies were abstracted for information on study
   characteristics (e.g., setting/population, design), PRISM contextual
   domains, and RE-AIM outcomes. Results A total of 180 articles were
   identified to include PRISM to some degree. Thirty-two articles
   representing 23 unique studies integrated PRISM within their study
   design. Study characteristics varied widely and included studies
   conducted in diverse contexts, but predominately in high-income
   countries and in clinical out-patient settings. With regards to use, 19
   used PRISM for evaluation, 10 for planning/development, 10 for
   implementation, four for sustainment, and one for dissemination. There
   was substantial variation across studies in how and to what degree PRISM
   contextual domains and RE-AIM outcomes were operationalized and
   connected. Only two studies directly connected individual PRISM context
   domains with RE-AIM outcomes, and another four included RE-AIM outcomes
   without direct connection to PRISM domains. Conclusions This is the
   first systematic review of the use of PRISM in various contexts. While
   there were low levels of `integrated' use of PRISM and few reports on
   linkage to RE-AIM outcomes, most studies included important context
   domains of implementation and sustainability infrastructure and external
   environment. Recommendations are provided for more consistent and
   comprehensive use of and reporting on PRISM to inform both research and
   practice on contextual factors in implementation.},

Title = {Partnered implementation of the veteran sponsorship initiative: protocol

Abstract = {Background: The USA is undergoing a suicide epidemic for its youngest
   Veterans (18-to-34-years-old) as their suicide rate has almost doubled
   since 2001. Veterans are at the highest risk during their first-year
   post-discharge, thus creating a ``deadly gap.{''} In response, the
   nation has developed strategies that emphasize a preventive, universal,
   and public health approach and embrace the value of community
   interventions. The three-step theory of suicide suggests that community
   interventions that reduce reintegration difficulties and promote
   connectedness for Veterans as they transition to civilian life have the
   greatest likelihood of reducing suicide. Recent research shows that the
   effectiveness of community interventions can be enhanced when augmented
   by volunteer and certified sponsors (1-on-1) who actively engage with
   Veterans, as part of the Veteran Sponsorship Initiative (VSI).
   Method/design: The purpose of this randomized hybrid type 2
   effectiveness-implementation trial is to evaluate the implementation of
   the VSI in six cities in Texas in collaboration with the US Departments
   of Defense, Labor and Veterans Affairs, Texas government, and local
   stakeholders. Texas is an optimal location for this large-scale
   implementation as it has the second largest population of these young
   Veterans and is home to the largest US military installation, Fort Hood.
   The first aim is to determine the effectiveness of the VSI, as evidenced
   by measures of reintegration difficulties, health/psychological
   distress, VA healthcare utilization, connectedness, and suicidal risk.
   The second aim is to determine the feasibility and potential utility of
   a stakeholder-engaged plan for implementing the VSI in Texas with the
   intent of future expansion in more states. The evaluators will use a
   stepped wedge design with a sequential roll-out to participating cities
   over time. Participants (n=630) will be enrolled on military
   installations six months prior to discharge. Implementation efforts will
   draw upon a bundled implementation strategy that includes strategies
   such as ongoing training, implementation facilitation, and audit and
   feedback. Formative and summative evaluations will be guided by the
   Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM)
   framework and will include interviews with participants and periodic
   reflections with key stakeholders to longitudinally identify barriers
   and facilitators to implementation.
   Discussion: This evaluation will have important implications for the
   national implementation of community interventions that address the
   epidemic of Veteran suicide. Aligned with the Evidence Act, it is the
   first large-scale implementation of an evidence-based practice that
   conducts a thorough assessment of TSMVs during the ``deadly gap.{''}},

Title = {Implementation strategy in collaboration with people with lived
   experience of mental illness to reduce stigma among primary care
   providers in Nepal (RESHAPE): protocol for a type 3 hybrid
   implementation effectiveness cluster randomized controlled trial},

Abstract = {Background: There are increasing efforts for the integration of mental
   health services into primary care settings in low- and middle-income
   countries. However, commonly used approaches to train primary care
   providers (PCPs) may not achieve the expected outcomes for improved
   service delivery, as evidenced by low detection rates of mental
   illnesses after training. One contributor to this shortcoming is the
   stigma among PCPs. Implementation strategies for training PCPs that
   reduce stigma have the potential to improve the quality of services.
   Design: In Nepal, a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness cluster
   randomized controlled trial will evaluate the implementation-as-usual
   training for PCPs compared to an alternative implementation strategy to
   train PCPs, entitled Reducing Stigma among Healthcare Providers
   (RESHAPE). In implementation-as-usual, PCPs are trained on the World
   Health Organization Mental Health Gap Action Program Intervention Guide
   (mhGAP-IG) with trainings conducted by mental health specialists. In
   RESHAPE, mhGAP-IG training includes the added component of facilitation
   by people with lived experience of mental illness (PWLE) and their
   caregivers using PhotoVoice, as well as aspirational figures. The
   duration of PCP training is the same in both arms. Co-primary outcomes
   of the study are stigma among PCPs, as measured with the Social Distance
   Scale at 6 months post-training, and reach, a domain from the RE-AIM
   implementation science framework. Reach is operationalized as the
   accuracy of detection of mental illness in primary care facilities and
   will be determined by psychiatrists at 3 months after PCPs diagnose the
   patients. Stigma will be evaluated as a mediator of reach.
   Cost-effectiveness and other RE-AIM outcomes will be assessed.
   Twenty-four municipalities, the unit of clustering, will be randomized
   to either mhGAP-IG implementation-as-usual or RESHAPE arms, with
   approximately 76 health facilities and 216 PCPs divided equally between
   arms. An estimated 1100 patients will be enrolled for the evaluation of
   accurate diagnosis of depression, generalized anxiety disorder,
   psychosis, or alcohol use disorder. Masking will include PCPs, patients,
   and psychiatrists.
   Discussion: This study will advance the knowledge of stigma reduction
   for training PCPs in partnership with PWLE. This collaborative approach
   to training has the potential to improve diagnostic competencies. If
   successful, this implementation strategy could be scaled up throughout
   low-resource settings to reduce the global treatment gap for mental
   illness.},

Title = {Revisiting concepts of evidence in implementation science},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {Background Evidence, in multiple forms, is a foundation of
   implementation science. For public health and clinical practice,
   evidence includes the following: type 1 evidence on etiology and burden;
   type 2 evidence on effectiveness of interventions; and type 3: evidence
   on dissemination and implementation (D\&I) within context. To support a
   vision for development and use of evidence in D\&I science that is more
   comprehensive and equitable (particularly for type 3 evidence), this
   article aims to clarify concepts of evidence, summarize ongoing debates
   about evidence, and provide a set of recommendations and tools/resources
   for addressing the ``how-to{''} in filling evidence gaps most critical
   to advancing implementation science. Main text Because current
   conceptualizations of evidence have been relatively narrow and
   insufficiently characterized in our opinion, we identify and discuss
   challenges and debates about the uses, usefulness, and gaps in evidence
   for implementation science. A set of questions is proposed to assist in
   determining when evidence is sufficient for dissemination and
   implementation. Intersecting gaps include the need to (1) reconsider how
   the evidence base is determined, (2) improve understanding of contextual
   effects on implementation, (3) sharpen the focus on health equity in how
   we approach and build the evidence-base, (4) conduct more policy
   implementation research and evaluation, and (5) learn from audience and
   stakeholder perspectives. We offer 15 recommendations to assist in
   filling these gaps and describe a set of tools for enhancing the
   evidence most needed in implementation science. Conclusions To address
   our recommendations, we see capacity as a necessary ingredient to shift
   the field's approach to evidence. Capacity includes the ``push{''} for
   implementation science where researchers are trained to develop and
   evaluate evidence which should be useful and feasible for implementers
   and reflect community or stakeholder priorities. Equally important,
   there has been inadequate training and too little emphasis on the
   ``pull{''} for implementation science (e.g., training implementers,
   practice-based research). We suggest that funders and reviewers of
   research should adopt and support a more robust definition of evidence.
   By critically examining the evolving nature of evidence, implementation
   science can better fulfill its vision of facilitating widespread and
   equitable adoption, delivery, and sustainment of scientific advances.},

Abstract = {Background: Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) is frequently used to
   inform qualitative research that aims to explain and evaluate processes
   that shape late-stage translation of innovations in the organisation and
   delivery of healthcare. A coding manual for qualitative researchers
   using NPT will facilitate transparent data analysis processes and will
   also reduce the cognitive and practical burden on researchers.
   Objectives: (a) To simplify the theory for the user. (b) To describe the
   purposes, methods of development, and potential application of a coding
   manual that translates normalisation process theory (NPT) into an easily
   usable framework for qualitative analysis. (c) To present an NPT coding
   manual that is ready for use.
   Method: Qualitative content analysis of papers and chapters that
   developed normalisation process theory, selection and structuring of
   theory constructs, and testing constructs against interview data and
   published empirical studies using NPT.
   Results: A coding manual for NPT was developed. It consists of 12
   primary NPT constructs and conforms to the Context-Mechanism-Outcome
   configuration of realist evaluation studies. Contexts are defined as
   settings in which implementation work is done, in which strategic
   intentions, adaptive execution, negotiating capability, and reframing
   organisational logics are enacted. Mechanisms are defined as the work
   that people do when they participate in implementation processes and
   include coherence-building, cognitive participation, collective action,
   and reflexive monitoring. Outcomes are defined as effects that make
   visible how things change as implementation processes proceed and
   include intervention mobilisation, normative restructuring, relational
   restructuring, and sustainment.
   Conclusion: The coding manual is ready to use and performs three
   important tasks. It consolidates several iterations of theory
   development, makes the application of NPT simpler for the user, and
   links NPT constructs to realist evaluation methods. The coding manual
   forms the core of a translational framework for implementation research
   and evaluation.},

Title = {Conceptualizing outcomes for use with the Consolidated Framework for
   Implementation Research (CFIR): the CFIR Outcomes Addendum},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background The challenges of implementing evidence-based innovations
   (EBIs) are widely recognized among practitioners and researchers.
   Context, broadly defined as everything outside the EBI, includes the
   dynamic and diverse array of forces working for or against
   implementation efforts. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation
   Research (CFIR) is one of the most widely used frameworks to guide
   assessment of contextual determinants of implementation. The original
   2009 article invited critique in recognition for the need for the
   framework to evolve. As implementation science has matured, gaps in the
   CFIR have been identified and updates are needed. Our team is developing
   the CFIR 2.0 based on a literature review and follow-up survey with
   authors. We propose an Outcomes Addendum to the CFIR to address
   recommendations from these sources to include outcomes in the framework.
   Main text We conducted a literature review and surveyed corresponding
   authors of included articles to identify recommendations for the CFIR.
   There were recommendations to add both implementation and innovation
   outcomes from these sources. Based on these recommendations, we make
   conceptual distinctions between (1) anticipated implementation outcomes
   and actual implementation outcomes, (2) implementation outcomes and
   innovation outcomes, and (3) CFIR-based implementation determinants and
   innovation determinants. Conclusion An Outcomes Addendum to the CFIR is
   proposed. Our goal is to offer clear conceptual distinctions between
   types of outcomes for use with the CFIR, and perhaps other determinant
   implementation frameworks as well. These distinctions can help bring
   clarity as researchers consider which outcomes are most appropriate to
   evaluate in their research. We hope that sharing this in advance will
   generate feedback and debate about the merits of our proposed addendum.},

Title = {Changing the preschool setting to promote healthy energy balance-related
   behaviours of preschoolers: a qualitative and quantitative process
   evaluation of the SuperFIT approach},

Abstract = {Background The Early Care and Education (ECE) setting plays an important
   role in the promotion of a healthy lifestyle in young children. SuperFIT
   is a comprehensive, integrated intervention approach designed to promote
   healthy energy balance-related behaviours in preschoolers. Insight in
   the process of implementation and the context in which SuperFIT was
   implemented supports the understanding of how the intervention works in
   practice. This process evaluation examined factors that influenced the
   implementation and maintenance, as well as the (perceived) changes in
   the ECE setting.
   Methods A mixed-methods study was conducted. SuperFIT was implemented at
   twelve preschools in the south of the Netherlands. The process
   evaluation was performed among preschool teachers, managers of the
   preschool organisation, and implementers. Semi-structured in-depth
   (group) interviews, quantitative process questionnaires, the Child-care
   Food and Activity Practices Questionnaire (CFAPQ) and the Environmental
   and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) were used to evaluate the
   implementation and maintenance of SuperFIT and the changes in the
   preschool setting. The interviews were analysed using a theoretical
   framework based on the Implementation Framework of Fleuren and
   Damschroder's Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.
   Descriptive analyses were performed on the quantitative data. Results
   Various intervention activities were implemented in the preschool
   setting. Although the intention to maintain SuperFIT was present, this
   was hindered by time constraints and lack of financial resources.
   Important factors that influenced implementation and maintenance were
   incongruence with current practice, limited perceived capabilities to
   integrate SuperFIT in daily practice, group composition at the
   preschools, and the perceived top-down implementation. Organizational
   vision and societal attention regarding healthy behaviour in general
   were perceived to be supportive for implementation and maintenance.
   Predominantly, favourable changes were seen in the nutrition- and
   physical activity-related practices of preschool teachers and other
   aspects of the social preschool environment such as the use of play
   materials. Limited changes were observed in the physical preschool
   environment.
   Conclusions Several factors influenced the implementation and
   maintenance of SuperFIT in the preschool setting. Some factors evolved
   over time from hindering to facilitating, emphasising the importance of
   allowing sufficient time for intervention implementation. SuperFIT
   changed mainly the social preschool environment.},

Abstract = {Background: The Clinical Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of
   Work-related Mental Health Conditions in General Practice (the
   Guideline) was published in 2019. The objective of this trial is to
   implement the Guideline in general practice.
   Trial design: Implementing work-related Mental health conditions in
   general PRacticE is a hybrid III, parallel cluster randomised controlled
   trial undertaken in Australia. Its primary aim is to assess the
   effectiveness of a complex intervention on the implementation of the
   Guideline in general practice. Secondary aims are to assess patient
   health and work outcomes, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the
   trial, and to develop a plan for sustainability.
   Methods: A total of 86 GP clusters will be randomly allocated either to
   the intervention arm, where they will receive a complex intervention
   comprising academic detailing, enrolment in a community of practice and
   resources, or to the control arm, where they will not receive the
   intervention. GP guideline concordance will be assessed at baseline and
   9 months using virtual simulated patient scenarios. Patients who meet
   the eligibility criteria (>18years, employed, and receiving care from a
   participating GP for a suspected or confirmed work-related mental health
   condition) will be invited to complete surveys about their health and
   work participation and provide access to their health service use data.
   Data on health service use and work participation compensation claim
   data will be combined with measures of guideline concordance and patient
   outcomes to inform an economic evaluation. A realist evaluation will be
   conducted to inform the development of a plan for sustainability.
   Results: We anticipate that GPs who receive the intervention will have
   higher guideline concordance than GPs in the control group. We also
   anticipate that higher concordance will translate to better health and
   return-to-work outcomes for patients, as well as cost-savings to
   society.
   Conclusions: The trial builds on a body of work defining the role of GPs
   in compensable injury, exploring their concerns, and developing
   evidence-based guidelines to address them. Implementation of these
   guidelines has the potential to deliver improvements in GP care, patient
   health, and return-to-work outcomes.},

Title = {Enhancing the Behaviour Change Wheel with synthesis, stakeholder
   involvement and decision-making: a case example using the `Enhancing the
   Quality of Psychological Interventions Delivered by Telephone' (EQUITy)
   research programme},

Abstract = {Background Using frameworks such as the Behaviour Change Wheel to
   develop behaviour change interventions can be challenging because
   judgement is needed at various points in the process and it is not
   always clear how uncertainties can be resolved. We propose a transparent
   and systematic three-phase process to transition from a research
   evidence base to a behaviour change intervention. The three phases
   entail evidence synthesis, stakeholder involvement and decision-making.
   We present the systematic development of an intervention to enhance the
   quality of psychological treatment delivered by telephone, as a worked
   example of this process. Method In phase 1 (evidence synthesis), we
   propose that the capabilities (C), opportunities (O) and motivations (M)
   model of behaviour change (COM-B) can be used to support the synthesis
   of a varied corpus of empirical evidence and to identify domains to be
   included in a proposed behaviour change intervention. In phase 2
   (stakeholder involvement), we propose that formal consensus procedures
   (e.g. the RAND Health/University of California-Los Angeles
   Appropriateness Methodology) can be used to facilitate discussions of
   proposed domains with stakeholder groups. In phase 3 (decision-making),
   we propose that behavioural scientists identify (with public/patient
   input) intervention functions and behaviour change techniques using the
   acceptability, practicability, effectiveness/cost-effectiveness,
   affordability, safety/side-effects and equity (APEASE) criteria. Results
   The COM-B model was a useful tool that allowed a multidisciplinary
   research team, many of whom had no prior knowledge of behavioural
   science, to synthesise effectively a varied corpus of evidence (phase 1:
   evidence synthesis). The RAND Health/University of California-Los
   Angeles Appropriateness Methodology provided a transparent means of
   involving stakeholders (patients, practitioners and key informants in
   the present example), a structured way in which they could identify
   which of 93 domains identified in phase 1 were essential for inclusion
   in the intervention (phase 2: stakeholder involvement). Phase 3
   (decision-making) was able to draw on existing Behaviour Change Wheel
   resources to revisit phases 1 and 2 and facilitate agreement among
   behavioural scientists on the final intervention modules. Behaviour
   changes were required at service, practitioner, patient and community
   levels. Conclusion Frameworks offer a foundation for intervention
   development but require additional elucidation at each stage of the
   process. The decisions adopted in this study are designed to provide an
   example on how to resolve challenges while designing a behaviour change
   intervention. We propose a three-phase process, which represents a
   transparent and systematic framework for developing behaviour change
   interventions in any setting.},

Title = {Implementation fidelity of the Systems for Person-Centered Elder Care
   (SPEC): a process evaluation study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Background: The Systems for Person-Centered Elder Care (SPEC), a complex
   intervention, was conducted to examine its effectiveness as a
   technology-enhanced, multidisciplinary, and integrated care model for
   frail older persons among ten nursing homes (NHs) in South Korea where
   formal long-term care has recently been introduced. The purpose of this
   study was to evaluate the implementation fidelity of the SPEC
   intervention and to identify moderating factors that influence the
   implementation fidelity.
   Methods: This study was a process evaluation based on an evidence-based
   framework for implementation fidelity using a mixed-methods design.
   Quantitative data from consultant logbooks, NH documentations, an
   information and communications technology (ICT) system, and a
   standardized questionnaire were collected from April 2015 to December
   2016 and analyzed by calculating the descriptive statistics.
   Semi-structured focus group interviews were held with multidisciplinary
   teams from the participating NHs. Qualitative data from a
   semi-structured questionnaire and the focus group interviews were
   analyzed using content analysis.
   Results: The SPEC program demonstrated good implementation fidelity, and
   adherence to the SPEC program was strong in all aspects, such as
   content, coverage, frequency, and duration. Of the participating on-site
   coordinators, 60\% reported that the SPEC model positively impacted
   needs assessment and the reporting system for resident care. The
   important facilitating factors were tailored facilitating strategies,
   assurance of the quality of delivery, and recruitment strategies.
   Conclusion: The effectiveness of the SPEC program was driven by good
   implementation fidelity. The key factors of good implementation fidelity
   were tailored delivery of evidence-based interventions over process
   evaluation work, facilitating strategies, and ICT support. Larger
   implementation studies with a more user-friendly ICT system are
   recommended.},

Title = {Economic evaluation of a web-based menu planning intervention to improve
   childcare service adherence with dietary guidelines},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {BackgroundDespite the known benefits of healthy eating in childhood, few
   Australian childcare services provide food that is consistent with
   dietary guidelines. The effectiveness of a web-based menu planning
   intervention to increase childcare service provision of healthy foods
   and decrease provision of discretionary foods in long day-care services
   in Australia was assessed in a randomised controlled trial. Here we
   consider the costs, consequences, cost-effectiveness and budget impact
   of the intervention using data collected within the trial.MethodsThe
   prospective trial-based economic evaluation involved 54 childcare
   services across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Services were
   randomised to a 12-month intervention or usual care. The intervention
   involved access to a web-based menu planning and decision support tool
   and online resources. Effectiveness measures included mean number of
   food groups, overall menu and individual food group compliance with
   dietary guidelines, and mean servings of food groups at 12months. Costs
   (reported in \$AUD, 2017/18) were evaluated from both health sector and
   societal perspectives. The direct cost to support uptake of the
   intervention was calculated, as were costs to each childcare service.
   The incremental cost of the intervention was calculated as the net
   difference in the cost to undertake menu planning and review plus the
   direct cost of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
   (ICERs) including uncertainty intervals were estimated for differences
   in costs and effects between intervention and control groups. A relative
   value index was calculated to determine overall value for
   money.ResultsOver the 12months of the trial, we calculated a difference
   in cost between usual practice and intervention groups of - \$482 (95\%
   UI - \$859, - \$56). While the measured increase in menu and food group
   compliance within the trial did not reach statistical significance,
   there were significant improvements in mean servings of fruit and
   discretionary food, represented in the cost-consequence analysis. The
   calculated relative value index of 1.1 suggests that the intervention
   returns acceptable value for money for the outcomes
   generated.ConclusionCompared to usual practice, web-based programmes may
   offer an efficient and sustainable alternative for childcare services to
   improve the provision of healthy foods to children in their care.Trial

Title = {The Implementation Research Logic Model: a method for planning,
   executing, reporting, and synthesizing implementation projects},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {Background Numerous models, frameworks, and theories exist for specific
   aspects of implementation research, including for determinants,
   strategies, and outcomes. However, implementation research projects
   often fail to provide a coherent rationale or justification for how
   these aspects are selected and tested in relation to one another.
   Despite this need to better specify the conceptual linkages between the
   core elements involved in projects, few tools or methods have been
   developed to aid in this task. The Implementation Research Logic Model
   (IRLM) was created for this purpose and to enhance the rigor and
   transparency of describing the often-complex processes of improving the
   adoption of evidence-based interventions in healthcare delivery systems.
   Methods The IRLM structure and guiding principles were developed through
   a series of preliminary activities with multiple investigators
   representing diverse implementation research projects in terms of
   contexts, research designs, and implementation strategies being
   evaluated. The utility of the IRLM was evaluated in the course of a
   2-day training to over 130 implementation researchers and healthcare
   delivery system partners. Results Preliminary work with the IRLM
   produced a core structure and multiple variations for common
   implementation research designs and situations, as well as guiding
   principles and suggestions for use. Results of the survey indicated a
   high utility of the IRLM for multiple purposes, such as improving rigor
   and reproducibility of projects; serving as a ``roadmap{''} for how the
   project is to be carried out; clearly reporting and specifying how the
   project is to be conducted; and understanding the connections between
   determinants, strategies, mechanisms, and outcomes for their project.
   Conclusions The IRLM is a semi-structured, principle-guided tool
   designed to improve the specification, rigor, reproducibility, and
   testable causal pathways involved in implementation research projects.
   The IRLM can also aid implementation researchers and implementation
   partners in the planning and execution of practice change initiatives.
   Adaptation and refinement of the IRLM are ongoing, as is the development
   of resources for use and applications to diverse projects, to address
   the challenges of this complex scientific field.},

Title = {Towards a comprehensive model for understanding adaptations' impact: the
   model for adaptation design and impact (MADI)},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Background: Implementation science is shifting from qualifying
   adaptations as good or bad towards understanding adaptations and their
   impact. Existing adaptation classification frameworks are largely
   descriptive (e.g., who made the adaptation) and geared towards
   researchers. They do not help practitioners in decision-making around
   adaptations (e.g., is an adaptation likely to have negative impacts?
   Should it be pursued?). Moreover, they lack constructs to consider
   ``ripple effects{''} of adaptations (i.e., both intended and unintended
   impacts on outcomes, recognizing that an adaptation designed to have a
   positive impact on one outcome may have unintended impacts on other
   outcomes). Finally, they do not specify relationships between
   adaptations and outcomes, including mediating and moderating
   relationships. The objective of our research was to promote systematic
   assessment of intended and unintended impacts of adaptations by using
   existing frameworks to create a model that proposes relationships among
   constructs.
   Materials and methods: We reviewed, consolidated, and refined constructs
   from two adaptation frameworks and one intervention-implementation
   outcome framework. Using the consolidated and refined constructs, we
   coded qualitative descriptions of 14 adaptations made to an existing
   evidence-based intervention; the 14 adaptations were designed in prior
   research by a stakeholder panel using a modified Delphi approach. Each
   of the 14 adaptations had detailed descriptions, including the nature of
   the adaptation, who made it, and its goal and reason. Using coded data,
   we arranged constructs from existing frameworks into a model, the Model
   for Adaptation Design and Impact (MADI), that identifies adaptation
   characteristics, their intended and unintended impacts (i.e., ripple
   effects), and potential mediators and moderators of adaptations' impact
   on outcomes. We also developed a decision aid and website
   (MADIguide.org) to help implementation scientists apply MADI in their
   work.
   Results and conclusions: Our model and associated decision aids build on
   existing frameworks by comprehensively characterizing adaptations,
   proposing how adaptations impact outcomes, and offering practical
   guidance for designing adaptations. MADI encourages researchers to think
   about potential causal pathways of adaptations (e.g., mediators and
   moderators) and adaptations' intended and unintended impacts on
   outcomes. MADI encourages practitioners to design adaptations in a way
   that anticipates intended and unintended impacts and leverages best
   practice from research.},

Title = {Establishing cross-systems collaborations for implementation: protocol
   for a longitudinal mixed methods study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Background: Cross-system interventions can help integrate services
   across different service delivery systems but require organizations to
   establish strong collaborative relationships for implementation.
   Contingency theory suggests that the effectiveness of different
   collaborative strategies (i.e. specific ways organizations align
   operations and services) varies by context. This paper describes a study
   of different strategies for fostering collaboration between child
   welfare and substance abuse treatment agencies and the conditions under
   which they are effective for implementation. We also describe the
   development and piloting of the Collaborating Across Systems for Program
   Implementation (CASPI) tool-a decision-making guide intended to help
   researchers and organizational leaders identify and use appropriate
   collaborative strategies for their context.
   Methods/design: This multisite longitudinal, mixed methods study,
   leverages a naturally occurring implementation initiative - in up to 17
   Ohio counties - to implement Ohio START (Sobriety Treatment and Reducing
   Trauma). START is a child welfare model that requires strong
   collaboration with local substance use treatment organizations to
   promote integrated services. During the first two years, we will
   identify collaborative strategies associated with improved START
   implementation (penetration and fidelity) and service delivery outcomes
   (timeliness), given system, and organizational features. We will conduct
   a convergent mixed methods study drawing on worker surveys, agency
   documents, administrative data, formal partner agreements, and group
   interviews. Data will be integrated and analyzed using Qualitative
   Comparative Analysis (QCA). To develop the CASPI, an expert panel
   comprised of implementation experts, and community stakeholders will
   convene to synthesize our findings and develop contents (including a
   decision tree). During the final year of the study, we will assess the
   acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the CASPI in a
   randomized vignette experiment, and a pilot-test with 3 child welfare
   agencies that have not yet implemented START.
   Discussion: Our results will lay the groundwork for a larger controlled
   trial that will test the CASPI's effectiveness for supporting effective
   and efficient implementation of cross-system interventions like START.
   The CASPI is expected to help leaders and researchers select and use
   collaboration strategies tailored to their context and be applicable in
   a wide range of settings including rural communities. Our work also
   advances system-level implementation strategies.},

Title = {The sustainability of public health interventions in schools: a
   systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {Background The sustainability of school-based health interventions after
   external funds and/or other resources end has been relatively unexplored
   in comparison to health care. If effective interventions discontinue,
   new practices cannot reach wider student populations and investment in
   implementation is wasted. This review asked: What evidence exists about
   the sustainability of school-based public health interventions? Do
   schools sustain public health interventions once start-up funds end?
   What are the barriers and facilitators affecting the sustainability of
   public health interventions in schools in high-income countries? Methods
   Seven bibliographic databases and 15 websites were searched. References
   and citations of included studies were searched, and experts and authors
   were contacted to identify relevant studies. We included reports
   published from 1996 onwards. References were screened on title/abstract,
   and those included were screened on full report. We conducted data
   extraction and appraisal using an existing tool. Extracted data were
   qualitatively synthesised for common themes, using May's General Theory
   of Implementation (2013) as a conceptual framework. Results Of the 9677
   unique references identified through database searching and other search
   strategies, 24 studies of 18 interventions were included in the review.
   No interventions were sustained in their entirety; all had some
   components that were sustained by some schools or staff, bar one that
   was completely discontinued. No discernible relationship was found
   between evidence of effectiveness and sustainability. Key facilitators
   included commitment/support from senior leaders, staff observing a
   positive impact on students' engagement and wellbeing, and staff
   confidence in delivering health promotion and belief in its value.
   Important contextual barriers emerged: the norm of prioritising
   educational outcomes under time and resource constraints, insufficient
   funding/resources, staff turnover and a lack of ongoing training.
   Adaptation of the intervention to existing routines and changing
   contexts appeared to be part of the sustainability process. Conclusions
   Existing evidence suggests that sustainability depends upon schools
   developing and retaining senior leaders and staff that are
   knowledgeable, skilled and motivated to continue delivering health
   promotion through ever-changing circumstances. Evidence of effectiveness
   did not appear to be an influential factor. However, methodologically
   stronger primary research, informed by theory, is needed.},

Abstract = {Background The PACE `Steps to Success' programme is a complex
   educational and development intervention for staff to improve palliative
   care in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). In a cluster randomized
   controlled trial, this programme has been implemented in 37 LTCFs in 7
   European countries. Alongside an effectiveness study, a process
   evaluation study was conducted. This paper reports on the results of
   this process evaluation, of which the aim was to provide a more detailed
   understanding of the implementation of the PACE Programme across and
   within countries. Methods The process evaluation followed the Reach,
   Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework
   and involved various measures and tools, including diaries for country
   trainers, evaluation questionnaires for care staff, attendance lists and
   interviews (online and face-to-face, individual and in groups) with
   country trainers, managers, PACE coordinators and other staff members.
   Based on key elements of the PACE Programme, a priori criteria for a
   high, medium and low level of the RE-AIM components Reach, Adoption,
   Implementation and intention to Maintenance were defined. Qualitative
   data on factors affecting each RE-AIM component gathered in the online
   discussion groups and interviews were analysed according to the
   principles of thematic analysis. Results The performance of the PACE
   Programme on the RE-AIM components was highly variable within and across
   countries, with a high or medium score for in total 28 (out of 37) LTCFs
   on Reach, for 26 LTCFs on Adoption, for 35 LTCFs on Implementation and
   for 34 LTCFs on intention to Maintenance. The factors affecting
   performance on the different RE-AIM components could be classified into
   three major categories: (1) the PACE Programme itself and its way of
   delivery, (2) people working with the PACE Programme and (3) contextual
   factors. Several country-specific challenges in implementing the PACE
   Programme were identified. Conclusions The implementation of the PACE
   Programme was feasible but leaves room for improvement. Our analysis
   helps to better understand the optimal levels of training and
   facilitation and provides recommendations to improve implementation in
   the LTC setting. The results of the process evaluation will be used to
   further adapt and improve the PACE Programme prior to its further
   dissemination.},

Title = {Adapting evidence-informed complex population health interventions for
   new contexts: a systematic review of guidance},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {Background Adapting interventions that have worked elsewhere can save
   resources associated with developing new interventions for each specific
   context. While a developing body of evidence shows benefits of adapted
   interventions compared with interventions transported without
   adaptation, there are also examples of interventions which have been
   extensively adapted, yet have not worked in the new context. Decisions
   on when, to what extent, and how to adapt interventions therefore are
   not straightforward, particularly when conceptualising intervention
   effects as contingent upon contextual interactions in complex systems.
   No guidance currently addresses these questions comprehensively. To
   inform development of an overarching guidance on adaptation of complex
   population health interventions, this systematic review synthesises the
   content of the existing guidance papers. Methods We searched for papers
   published between January 2000 and October 2018 in 7 bibliographic
   databases. We used citation tracking and contacted authors and experts
   to locate further papers. We double screened all the identified records.
   We extracted data into the following categories: descriptive
   information, key concepts and definitions, rationale for adaptation,
   aspects of adaptation, process of adaptation, evaluating and reporting
   adapted interventions. Data extraction was conducted independently by
   two reviewers, and retrieved data were synthesised thematically within
   pre-specified and emergent categories. Results We retrieved 6694 unique
   records. Thirty-eight papers were included in the review representing 35
   sources of guidance. Most papers were developed in the USA in the
   context of implementing evidence-informed interventions among different
   population groups within the country, such as minority populations. We
   found much agreement on how the papers defined key concepts, aims, and
   procedures of adaptation, including involvement of key stakeholders, but
   also identified gaps in scope, conceptualisation, and operationalisation
   in several categories. Conclusions Our review found limitations that
   should be addressed in future guidance on adaptation. Specifically,
   future guidance needs to be reflective of adaptations in the context of
   transferring interventions across countries, including macro- (e.g.
   national-) level interventions, better theorise the role of intervention
   mechanisms and contextual interactions in the replicability of effects
   and accordingly conceptualise key concepts, such as fidelity to
   intervention functions, and finally, suggest evidence-informed
   strategies for adaptation re-evaluation and reporting.},

Title = {Action, actor, context, target, time (AACTT): a framework for specifying

Abstract = {Background Designing implementation interventions to change the
   behaviour of healthcare providers and other professionals in the health
   system requires detailed specification of the behaviour(s) targeted for
   change to ensure alignment between intervention components and measured
   outcomes. Detailed behaviour specification can help to clarify
   evidence-practice gaps, clarify who needs to do what differently,
   identify modifiable barriers and enablers, design interventions to
   address these and ultimately provides an indicator of what to measure to
   evaluate an intervention's effect on behaviour change. An existing
   behaviour specification framework proposes four domains (Target, Action,
   Context, Time; TACT), but insufficiently clarifies who is performing the
   behaviour (i.e. the Actor). Specifying the Actor is especially important
   in healthcare settings characterised by multiple behaviours performed by
   multiple different people. We propose and describe an extension and
   re-ordering of TACT to enhance its utility to implementation
   intervention designers, practitioners and trialists: the Action, Actor,
   Context, Target, Time (AACTT) framework. We aim to demonstrate its
   application across key steps of implementation research and to provide
   tools for its use in practice to clarify the behaviours of stakeholders
   across multiple levels of the healthcare system. Methods and results We
   used French et al.'s four-step implementation process model to describe
   the potential applications of the AACTT framework for (a) clarifying who
   needs to do what differently, (b) identifying barriers and enablers, (c)
   selecting fit-for-purpose intervention strategies and components and (d)
   evaluating implementation interventions. Conclusions Describing and
   detailing behaviour using the AACTT framework may help to enhance
   measurement of theoretical constructs, inform development of topic
   guides and questionnaires, enhance the design of implementation
   interventions and clarify outcome measurement for evaluating
   implementation interventions.},

Title = {The impact of basic vs. enhanced Go NAPSACC on child care centers'
   healthy eating and physical activity practices: protocol for a type 3
   hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: To prevent childhood obesity and promote healthy
   development, health authorities recommend that child care programs use
   the evidence-based practices that foster healthy eating and physical
   habits in children. Go NAPSACC is an intervention shown to improve use
   of these recommended practices, but it is known to encounter barriers
   that limit its impact and widespread use.
   Methods: This study will use a type 3 hybrid
   effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized trial to compare
   effectiveness and implementation outcomes achieved from Go NAPSACC
   delivered with a basic or enhanced implementation approach. Participants
   will include approximately 25 coaches from Child Care Aware of Kentucky
   (serving four geographic regions), 97 child care centers with a director
   and teacher from each and two cross-sectional samples of 485
   3-4-year-old children (one recruitment at baseline, another at
   follow-up). Coaches will be randomly assigned to deliver Go NAPSACC
   using either the basic or enhanced implementation approach. ``Basic Go
   NAPSACC{''} represents the traditional way of delivering Go NAPSACC.
   ``Enhanced Go NAPSACC{''} incorporates preparatory and support
   activities before and during their Go NAPSACC work, which are guided by
   the Quality Implementation Framework and the Consolidated Framework for
   Implementation Research. Data will be collected primarily at baseline
   and post-intervention, with select measures continuing through 6, 12,
   and 24 months postintervention. Guided largely by RE-AIM, outcomes will
   assess change in centers' use of evidence-based nutrition and physical
   activity practices (primary, measured via observation); centers'
   adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the Go NAPSACC program
   (assessed via website use); center directors', teachers', and coaches'
   perceptions of contextual factors (assessed via self-report surveys);
   children's eating and physical activity behaviors at child care
   (measured via observation and accelerometers); and cost-effectiveness
   (assessed via logs and expense tracking). The hypotheses anticipate that
   ``Enhanced Go NAPSACC{''} will have greater effects than ``Basic Go
   NAPSACC.{''}
   Discussion: This study incorporates many lessons gleaned from the

Abstract = {Background Designing implementation research can be a complex and
   daunting task, especially for applied health researchers who have not
   received specialist training in implementation science. We developed the
   Implementation Science Research Development (ImpRes) tool and
   supplementary guide to address this challenge and provide researchers
   with a systematic approach to designing implementation research. Methods
   A multi-method and multi-stage approach was employed. An international,
   multidisciplinary expert panel engaged in an iterative brainstorming and
   consensus-building process to generate core domains of the ImpRes tool,
   representing core implementation science principles and concepts that
   researchers should consider when designing implementation research.
   Simultaneously, an iterative process of reviewing the literature and
   expert input informed the development and content of the tool. Once
   consensus had been reached, specialist expert input was sought on
   involving and engaging patients/service users; and economic evaluation.
   ImpRes was then applied to 15 implementation and improvement science
   projects across the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)
   Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care
   (CLAHRC) South London, a research organisation in London, UK.
   Researchers who applied the ImpRes tool completed an 11-item
   questionnaire evaluating its structure, content and usefulness. Results
   Consensus was reached on ten implementation science domains to be
   considered when designing implementation research. These include
   implementation theories, frameworks and models, determinants of
   implementation, implementation strategies, implementation outcomes and
   unintended consequences. Researchers who used the ImpRes tool found it
   useful for identifying project areas where implementation science is
   lacking (median 5/5, IQR 4-5) and for improving the quality of
   implementation research (median 4/5, IQR 4-5) and agreed that it
   contained the key components that should be considered when designing
   implementation research (median 4/5, IQR 4-4). Qualitative feedback from
   researchers who applied the ImpRes tool indicated that a supplementary
   guide was needed to facilitate use of the tool. Conclusions We have
   developed a feasible and acceptable tool, and supplementary guide, to
   facilitate consideration and incorporation of core principles and
   concepts of implementation science in applied health implementation
   research. Future research is needed to establish whether application of
   the tool and guide has an effect on the quality of implementation
   research.},

Title = {The FRAME: an expanded framework for reporting adaptations and
   modifications to evidence-based interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {BackgroundThis paper describes the process and results of a refinement
   of a framework to characterize modifications to interventions. The
   original version did not fully capture several aspects of modification
   and adaptation that may be important to document and report.
   Additionally, the earlier framework did not include a way to
   differentiate cultural adaptation from adaptations made for other
   reasons. Reporting additional elements will allow for a more precise
   understanding of modifications, the process of modifying or adapting,
   and the relationship between different forms of modification and
   subsequent health and implementation outcomes.DiscussionWe employed a
   multifaceted approach to develop the updated FRAME involving coding
   documents identified through a literature review, rapid coding of
   qualitative interviews, and a refinement process informed by multiple
   stakeholders. The updated FRAME expands upon Stirman et al.'s original
   framework by adding components of modification to report: (1) when and
   how in the implementation process the modification was made, (2) whether
   the modification was planned/proactive (i.e., an adaptation) or
   unplanned/reactive, (3) who determined that the modification should be
   made, (4) what is modified, (5) at what level of delivery the
   modification is made, (6) type or nature of context or content-level
   modifications, (7) the extent to which the modification is
   fidelity-consistent, and (8) the reasons for the modification, including
   (a) the intent or goal of the modification (e.g., to reduce costs) and
   (b) contextual factors that influenced the decision. Methods of using
   the framework to assess modifications are outlined, along with their
   strengths and weaknesses, and considerations for research to validate
   these measurement strategies.ConclusionThe updated FRAME includes
   consideration of when and how modifications occurred, whether it was
   planned or unplanned, relationship to fidelity, and reasons and goals
   for modification. This tool that can be used to support research on the
   timing, nature, goals and reasons for, and impact of modifications to
   evidence-based interventions.},

Title = {Using implementation facilitation to implement primary care mental

   protocol for a hybrid type 2 cluster randomized stepped-wedge design},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {BackgroundIntegrating mental health providers into primary care clinics
   improves access to and outcomes of mental health care. In the Veterans
   Health Administration (VA) Primary Care Mental Health Integration
   (PCMHI) program, mental health providers are co-located in primary care
   clinics, but the implementation of this model is challenging outside
   large VA medical centers, especially for rural clinics without full
   mental health staffing. Long wait times for mental health care, little
   collaboration between mental health and primary care providers, and
   sub-optimal outcomes for rural veterans could result. Telehealth could
   be used to provide PCMHI to rural clinics; however, the clinical
   effectiveness of the tele-PCMHI model has not been tested. Based on
   evidence that implementation facilitation is an effective implementation
   strategy to increase uptake of PCMHI when delivered on-site at larger VA
   clinics, it is hypothesized that this strategy may also be effective
   with regard to ensuring adequate uptake of the tele-PCMHI model at rural
   VA clinics.MethodsThis study is a hybrid type 2 pragmatic
   effectiveness-implementation trial of tele-PCMHI in six sites over
   24months. Tele-PCMHI, which will be delivered by clinical staff
   available in routine care settings, will be compared to usual care.
   Fidelity to the care model will be monitored but not controlled. We will
   use the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM)
   framework to evaluate the patient-level clinical effectiveness of
   tele-PCMHI in rural VA clinics and also to evaluate the fidelity to and
   outcomes of the implementation strategy, implementation facilitation.
   The proposed study will employ a stepped-wedge design in which study
   sites sequentially begin implementation in three steps at 6-month
   intervals. Each step will include (1) a 6-month period of implementation
   planning, followed by (2) a 6-month period of active implementation, and
   (3) a final period of stepped-down implementation
   facilitation.DiscussionThis study will evaluate the effectiveness of
   PCMHI in a novel setting and via a novel method (clinical video
   telehealth). We will test the feasibility of using implementation
   facilitation as an implementation strategy to deploy tele-PCMHI in rural
   VA clinics.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov registration number

Abstract = {BackgroundAlignment across levels of leadership within an organization
   is needed for successful implementation of evidence-based practice. The
   leadership and organizational change for implementation (LOCI)
   intervention is a multi-faceted multilevel implementation strategy
   focusing on enhancing first-level general and implementation leadership
   while also engaging with organization upper management to develop an
   organizational climate for implementation. The aim of the project is to
   evaluate the effectiveness of LOCI in supporting the implementation of
   evidence-based treatment for PTSD in child- and adult-specialized mental
   health clinics in health trusts in Norway.MethodsThe study design is a
   stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial with enrollment of clinics in
   three cohorts. Executives, clinic leaders, and therapists will be asked
   to complete surveys assessing leadership and implementation climate.
   Surveys will be completed at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20months.
   Results from surveys will be shared with executives and clinic leaders
   to inform the subsequent creation of tailored leadership and climate
   development plans for enhanced implementation. Patients will complete
   surveys measuring traumatic events and post-traumatic stress symptoms
   during the therapy process. Therapy sessions will be audio or video
   recorded and scored for fidelity as part of training.DiscussionThis
   study aims to provide knowledge on how to improve leadership and
   organizational climate to enhance effective implementation of
   evidence-based treatments in mental health services.Trial

Title = {A randomised controlled trial of performance review and facilitated
   feedback to increase implementation of healthy eating and physical
   activity-promoting policies and practices in centre-based childcare},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: While it is recommended that childcare services implement
   policies and practices to support obesity prevention, there remains
   limited evidence to inform policy and practice. The aim of this study is
   to examine the effectiveness of performance review and facilitated
   feedback in increasing the implementation of healthy eating and physical
   activity-promoting policies and practices in childcare services.
   Methods: The study was conducted with childcare services in the Hunter
   New England region of New South Wales, Australia. Eligible services were
   randomised to a wait-list control group or to receive the implementation
   strategy. The strategy targeted the implementation of written nutrition,
   physical activity, and small screen recreation policies; providing
   information to families regarding healthy eating, physical activity, and
   small screen time; providing twice weekly healthy eating learning
   experiences to children; providing water and plain milk only to
   children; providing fundamental movement skills activities for children
   every day; and limiting the use of electronic screen time for
   educational purposes and learning experiences. Intervention services
   received a performance review and facilitated feedback process five
   times over the 10 months that included an assessment of current
   practices, goal setting, identification of barriers to implementation,
   problem-solving, and resource provision. The primary outcome was the
   proportion of services implementing all six policies and practices,
   assessed by nominated supervisor completion of a computer-assisted
   telephone interview at baseline and 12-month follow-up.
   Results: One hundred and eight services took part. There were no
   significant differences in the proportion of services implementing all
   six practices at 12 months (mean difference 0.51; 95\% CI 0.16 to 1.58;
   p = 0.24). There were also no differences between groups in the mean
   number of policies and practices implemented (mean difference 0.1; 95\%
   CI -0.4 to 0.6; p = 0.71), or the proportion implementing each of the
   six individual policies and practices at 12 months (OR range 0.57 to
   1.85; p > 0.05).
   Conclusions: Further support may be required to assist childcare
   services to make recommended changes to their policies and practices.},

Title = {Intermediary/purveyor organizations for evidence-based interventions in
   the US child mental health: characteristics and implementation
   strategies},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {BackgroundMany psychosocial interventions are disseminated and supported
   by organizations, termed Intermediary/Purveyor Organizations (IPOs).
   Because IPOs remain largely unstudied, we lack understanding of their
   scale and the strategies they utilize. The role and function of
   organizations that link resource systems with user systems, such as
   IPOs, have been identified as an important but understudied issue in
   implementation science. The objectives of this paper are to describe
   features of IPOs that disseminate evidence-based interventions (EBIs)
   for child behavioral health and identify the strategies they use to
   support their implementation.MethodsThe Substance Abuse and Mental
   Health Services (SAMHSA) National Registry of Evidence-based Programs
   and Practices (NREPP) listed 119 unique IPOs for the 127 child
   behavioral health EBIs listed on its website. Data characterizing each
   organization were drawn from NREPP and GuideStar profiles. From 119
   unique IPOs identified, we found contact information for 108. We sent an
   electronic survey to capture additional organizational information and
   implementation strategies the IPOs employed in spreading the EBIs;
   response rate was 50\%. Data are presented descriptively and analyzed
   using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and Latent Class Analysis
   (LCA).ResultsVirtually all identified EBIs had an IPO. IPOs train
   individuals, organizations, and communities and provide supervision for
   the use of EBIs. About 20\% of IPOs trained at large scale, some
   training 500-1000+ providers annually. IPOs reported using an average of
   32 distinct strategies to implement their EBIs, with most using
   educational, planning, and quality improvement strategies. However,
   there was little convergence around strategy helpfulness. The only
   significant predictor of number of strategies used by an IPO was the
   NREPP-posted implementation readiness score of the intervention. LCA
   revealed that IPOs either used several implementation strategies or used
   very few.ConclusionsFindings add significantly to knowledge about IPO
   structure, scale, and function. They use numerous and varying
   implementation strategies but report little consensus in what works. The
   study advances methods for measuring and characterizing real-world
   implementation by demonstrating the feasibility of using a common
   nomenclature, per a published compilation and of LCA for data reduction
   in characterizing profiles of implementation approaches.},

Title = {Developing an evidence-based program sustainability training curriculum:
   a group randomized, multi-phase approach},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Background: The emergence of dissemination and implementation (D\&I)
   science has driven a rapid increase in studies of how new scientific
   discoveries are translated and developed into evidence-based programs
   and policies. However, D\&I science has paid much less attention to what
   happens to programs once they have been implemented. Public health
   programs can only deliver benefits if they reach maturity and sustain
   activities over time. In order to achieve the full benefits of
   significant investment in public health research and program
   development, there must be an understanding of the factors that relate
   to sustainability to inform development of tools and trainings to
   support strategic long-term program sustainability. Tobacco control
   programs, specifically, vary in their abilities to support and sustain
   themselves over time. As of 2018, most states still do not meet the
   CDC-recommended level for funding their TC program, allowing tobacco use
   to remain the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the USA.
   The purpose of this study is to empirically develop, test, and
   disseminate training programs to improve the sustainability of
   evidence-based state tobacco control programs and thus, tobacco-related
   health outcomes.
   Methods: This paper describes the methods of a group randomized,
   multi-phase study that evaluates the empirically developed ``Program
   Sustainability Action Planning Training{''} and technical assistance in
   US state-level tobacco control programs. Phase 1 includes developing the
   sustainability action planning training curriculum and technical
   assistance protocol and developing measures to assess long-term program
   sustainability. Phase 2 includes a group randomized trial to test the
   effectiveness of the training and technical assistance in improving
   sustainability outcomes in 24 state tobacco control programs (12
   intervention, 12 comparison). Phase 3 includes the active dissemination
   of final training curricula materials to a broader public health
   audience.
   Discussion: Empirical evidence has established that program
   sustainability can improve through training and technical assistance;
   however, to our knowledge, no evidence-based sustainability training
   curriculum program exists. Therefore, systematic methods are needed to
   develop, test, and disseminate a training that improves the
   sustainability of evidence-based programs.},

Title = {Protocol for the ROSE sustainment (ROSES) study, a sequential multiple
   assignment randomized trial to determine the minimum necessary
   intervention to maintain a postpartum depression prevention program in
   prenatal clinics serving low-income women},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: More research on sustainment of interventions is needed,
   especially return on investment (ROI) studies to determine cost-benefit
   trade-offs for effort required to sustain and how much is gained when
   effective programs are sustained. The ROSE sustainment (ROSES) study
   uses a sequential multiple assignment randomized (SMART) design to
   evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a stepwise approach
   to sustainment of the ROSE postpartum depression prevention program in
   90 outpatient clinics providing prenatal care to pregnant women on
   public assistance. Postpartum depression (PPD) is common and can have
   lasting consequences. Outpatient clinics offering prenatal care are an
   opportune place to provide PPD prevention because most women visit while
   pregnant The ROSE (Reach Out Stay Strong, Essentials for mothers of
   newborns) program is a group educational intervention to prevent PPD,
   delivered during pregnancy. ROSE has been found to reduce cases of PPD
   in community prenatal settings serving low-income pregnant women.
   Methods: All 90 prenatal clinics will receive enhanced implementation as
   usual (EIAU; initial training + tools for sustainment). At the first
   time at which a clinic is determined to be at risk for failure to
   sustain (i.e., at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months), that clinic will be
   randomized to receive either (1) no additional implementation support
   (i.e., EIAU only), or (2) low-intensity coaching and feedback (LICF). If
   clinics receiving LICF are still at risk at subsequent assessments, they
   will be randomized to either (1) EIAU + LICF only, or (2) high-intensity
   coaching and feedback (HICF). Additional follow-up interviews will occur
   at 18, 24, and 30 months, but no implementation intervention will occur
   after 18 months. Outcomes include (1) percent sustainment of core
   program elements at each time point (2) health impact (PPD rates over
   time at each clinic) and reach, and (3) ROI (costs and
   cost-effectiveness) of each sustainment step. Hypothesized mechanisms
   include sustainment of capacity to deliver core elements and
   engagement/ownership.
   Discussion: This study is the first randomized trial evaluating the ROI
   of a stepped approach to sustainment a critical unanswered question in
   implementation science. It will also a dvance knowledge of
   implementation mechanisms and clinical care for an at-risk population.},

Abstract = {Background: Despite clinical guideline recommendations, implementation
   of antenatal care addressing alcohol consumption by pregnant women is
   limited. Implementation strategies addressing barriers to such care may
   be effective in increasing care provision. The aim of this study is to
   examine the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of a
   multi-strategy practice change intervention in increasing antenatal care
   addressing the consumption of alcohol by pregnant women.
   Methods: The study will be a randomised, stepped-wedge controlled trial
   conducted in three sectors in a health district in New South Wales,
   Australia. Stepped implementation of a practice change intervention will
   be delivered to sectors in a random order to support the introduction of
   a model of care for addressing alcohol consumption by pregnant women. A
   staged process was undertaken to develop the implementation strategies,
   which comprise of: leadership support, local clinical practice
   guidelines, electronic prompts and reminders, opinion leaders, academic
   detailing (audit and feedback), educational meetings and educational
   materials, and performance monitoring. Repeated cross-sectional outcome
   data will be gathered weekly across all sectors for the study duration.
   The primary outcome measures are the proportion of antenatal
   appointments at `booking in', 27-28 weeks gestation and 35-36 weeks
   gestation for which women report (1) being assessed for alcohol
   consumption, (2) being provided with brief advice related to alcohol
   consumption during pregnancy, (3) receiving relevant care for addressing
   alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and (4) being assessed for alcohol
   consumption and receiving relevant care. Data on resources expended
   during intervention development and implementation will be collected.
   The proportion of women who report consuming alcohol since knowing they
   were pregnant will be measured as a secondary outcome.
   Discussion: This will be the first randomised controlled trial to
   evaluate the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of
   implementation strategies in improving antenatal care that addresses
   alcohol consumption by pregnant women. If positive changes in clinical
   practice are found, this evidence will support health service adoption
   of implementation strategies to support improved antenatal care for this
   recognised risk to the health and wellbeing of the mother and child.},

Title = {Using Normalization Process Theory in feasibility studies and process
   evaluations of complex healthcare interventions: a systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Background: Normalization Process Theory (NPT) identifies, characterises
   and explains key mechanisms that promote and inhibit the implementation,
   embedding and integration of new health techniques, technologies and
   other complex interventions. A large body of literature that employs NPT
   to inform feasibility studies and process evaluations of complex
   healthcare interventions has now emerged. The aims of this review were
   to review this literature; to identify and characterise the uses and
   limits of NPT in research on the implementation and integration of
   healthcare interventions; and to explore NPT's contribution to
   understanding the dynamics of these processes.
   Methods: A qualitative systematic review was conducted. We searched Web
   of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar for articles with empirical data
   in peer-reviewed journals that cited either key papers presenting and
   developing NPT, or the NPT Online Toolkit
   (www.normalizationprocess.org). We included in the review only articles
   that used NPT as the primary approach to collection, analysis or
   reporting of data in studies of the implementation of healthcare
   techniques, technologies or other interventions. A structured data
   extraction instrument was used, and data were analysed qualitatively.
   Results: Searches revealed 3322 citations. We show that after
   eliminating 2337 duplicates and broken or junk URLs, 985 were screened
   as titles and abstracts. Of these, 101 were excluded because they did
   not fit the inclusion criteria for the review. This left 884 articles
   for full-text screening. Of these, 754 did not fit the inclusion
   criteria for the review. This left 130 papers presenting results from
   108 identifiable studies to be included in the review. NPT appears to
   provide researchers and practitioners with a conceptual vocabulary for
   rigorous studies of implementation processes. It identifies,
   characterises and explains empirically identifiable mechanisms that
   motivate and shape implementation processes. Taken together, these mean
   that analyses using NPT can effectively assist in the explanation of the
   success or failure of specific implementation projects. Ten percent of
   papers included critiques of some aspect of NPT, with those that did
   mainly focusing on its terminology. However, two studies critiqued NPT
   emphasis on agency, and one study critiqued NPT for its normative focus.
   Conclusions: This review demonstrates that researchers found NPT useful
   and applied it across a wide range of interventions. It has been
   effectively used to aid intervention development and implementation
   planning as well as evaluating and understanding implementation
   processes themselves. In particular, NPT appears to have offered a
   valuable set of conceptual tools to aid understanding of implementation
   as a dynamic process.},

Title = {``I had to somehow still be flexible{''}: exploring adaptations during
   implementation of brief cognitive behavioral therapy in primary care},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Background: Primary care clinics present challenges to implementing
   evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) for depression and anxiety, and
   frontline providers infrequently adopt these treatments. The current
   study explored providers' perspectives on fidelity to a manualized brief
   cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as delivered in primary care clinics
   as part of a pragmatic randomized trial. Data from the primary study
   demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of the treatment and indicated
   that providers delivered brief CBT with high fidelity, as evaluated by
   experts using a standardized rating form. Data presented here explore
   challenges providers faced during implementation and how they adapted
   nonessential intervention components to make the protocol ``fit{''} into
   their clinical practice.
   Methods: A multiprofessional group of providers (n = 18) completed a
   one-time semi-structured interview documenting their experiences using
   brief CBT in the primary care setting. Data were analyzed via directed
   content analysis, followed by inductive sorting of interview excerpts to
   identify key themes agreed upon by consensus. The Dynamic Adaptation
   Process model provided an overarching framework to allow better
   understanding and contextualization of emergent themes.
   Results: Providers described a variety of adaptations to the brief CBT
   to better enable its implementation. Adaptations were driven by provider
   skills and abilities (i.e., using flexible content and delivery options
   to promote treatment engagement), patient-emergent issues (i.e.,
   addressing patients' broader life and clinical concerns), and
   system-level resources (i.e., maximizing the time available to provide
   treatment).
   Conclusions: The therapeutic relationship, individual patient factors,
   and system-level factors were critical drivers guiding how providers
   adapted EBP delivery to improve the ``fit{''} into their clinical
   practice. Adaptations were generally informed by tensions between the
   EBP protocol and patient and system needs and were largely not addressed
   in the EBP protocol itself. Adaptations were generally viewed as
   acceptable by study fidelity experts and helped to more clearly define
   delivery procedures to improve future implementation efforts. It is
   recommended that future EBP implementation efforts examine the concept
   of fidelity on a continuum rather than dichotomized as adherent/not
   adherent with focused efforts to understand the context of EBP delivery.},

Title = {Implementation of a community-based intervention in the most rural and
   remote districts of Zambia: a process evaluation of safe motherhood
   action groups},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Background: A community-based intervention known as Safe Motherhood
   Action Groups (SMAGs) was implemented to increase coverage of maternal
   and neonatal health (MNH) services among the poorest and most remote
   populations in Zambia. While the outcome evaluation demonstrated
   statistically significant improvement in the MNH indicators, targets for
   key indicators were not achieved, and reasons for this shortfall were
   not known This study was aimed at understanding why the targeted key
   indicators for MNH services were not achieved
   Methods: A process evaluation, in accordance with the Medical Research
   Council (MRC) framework, was conducted in two selected rural districts
   of Zambia using qualitative approaches Focus group discussions were
   conducted with SMAGs, volunteer community health workers, and mothers
   and in-depth interviews with healthcare providers. Content analysis was
   done.
   Results: We found that SMAGs implemented much of the intervention as was
   intended, particularly in the area of women's education and referral to
   health facilities for skilled MNH services. The SMAGs went beyond their
   prescribed roles to assist women with household chores and personal
   problems and used their own resources to enhance the success of the
   intervention. Deficiencies in the intervention were reported and
   included poor ongoing support, inadequate supplies and lack of effective
   transportation such as bicycles needed for the SMAGs to facilitate then
   work. Factors external to the intervention, such as inadequacy of health
   services and skilled healthcare providers in facilities where SMAGs
   referred mothers and pool geographical access, may have led SMAGs to
   engage in the unintended role of conducting deliveries, thus
   compromising the outcome of the intervention
   Conclusion: We found evidence suggesting that although SMAGs continue to
   play prvotal roles in contribution towards accelerated coverage of MNH
   services among hard to reach populations, they are unable to meet some
   of the critical sets of MNH service targeted indicators The complexities
   of the implementation mechanisms coupled with the presence of setting
   specific socio cultural and geographical contextual factors could
   partially explain this failure. This suggests a need for innovating
   existing implementation strategies so as to help SMAGs and any other
   community health system champions to effectively respond to MNH needs of
   most at risk women and promote universal health coverage targeting
   hard-to-reach groups.},

Title = {To what extent can behaviour change techniques be identified within an
   adaptable implementation package for primary care? A prospective
   directed content analysis},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Background: Interpreting evaluations of complex interventions can be
   difficult without sufficient description of key intervention content. We
   aimed to develop an implementation package for primary care which could
   be delivered using typically available resources and could be adapted to
   target determinants of behaviour for each of four quality indicators:
   diabetes control, blood pressure control, anticoagulation for atrial
   fibrillation and risky prescribing. We describe the development and
   prospective verification of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) embedded
   within the adaptable implementation packages.
   Methods: We used an over-lapping multi-staged process. We identified
   evidence-based, candidate delivery mechanisms-mainly audit and feedback,
   educational outreach and computerised prompts and reminders. We drew
   upon interviews with primary care professionals using the Theoretical
   Domains Framework to explore likely determinants of adherence to quality
   indicators. We linked determinants to candidate BCTs. With input from
   stakeholder panels, we prioritised likely determinants and intervention
   content prior to piloting the implementation packages. Our content
   analysis assessed the extent to which embedded BCTs could be identified
   within the packages and compared them across the delivery mechanisms and
   four quality indicators.
   Results: Each implementation package included at least 27 out of 30
   potentially applicable BCTs representing 15 of 16 BCT categories. Whilst
   23 BCTs were shared across all four implementation packages (e.g. BCTs
   relating to feedback and comparing behaviour), some BCTs were unique to
   certain delivery mechanisms (e.g. `graded tasks' and `problem solving'
   for educational outreach). BCTs addressing the determinants
   `environmental context' and `social and professional roles' (e.g.
   `restructuring the social and `physical environment' and `adding objects
   to the environment') were indicator specific. We found it challenging to
   operationalise BCTs targeting `environmental context', `social
   influences' and `social and professional roles' within our chosen
   delivery mechanisms.
   Conclusion: We have demonstrated a transparent process for selecting,
   operationalising and verifying the BCT content in implementation
   packages adapted to target four quality indicators in primary care.
   There was considerable overlap in BCTs identified across the four
   indicators suggesting core BCTs can be embedded and verified within
   delivery mechanisms commonly available to primary care. Whilst feedback
   reports can include a wide range of BCTs, computerised prompts can
   deliver BCTs at the time of decision making, and educational outreach
   can allow for flexibility and individual tailoring in delivery.},

Title = {Operationalizing a model to quantify implementation of a multi-component
   intervention in a stepped-wedge trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {Background: It is challenging to interpret the results of multifaceted
   interventions due to complex program theories that are difficult to
   measure in a quantifiable manner. The aims of this paper were, first, to
   develop a model for a comprehensive quantitative implementation
   evaluation and, second, to operationalize it in the process evaluation
   of the stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial: ``Prevention
   of low back pain and its consequences among nurses' aides in elderly
   care{''} to investigate if implementation differed across intervention
   components, steps, and settings (workplaces).
   Methods: Operationalization of a quantifiable measure of implementation
   requires three steps: (1) development of a program logic and
   intervention protocol, (2) description of a complete and acceptable
   delivery of the intervention, and (3) description of what determines the
   receipt of the intervention. Program logic from a previously developed
   multifaceted stepped-wedge intervention was used. The optimal delivery
   of the intervention was defined as the deliverers' full understanding
   and following of the intervention protocol and that they performed their
   best and contributed to the participants' attention and motivation
   (fidelity). The optimal receipt of the intervention was defined as
   participants being fully present at all intervention activities
   (participation), being motivated and satisfied, and having a good social
   support (responsiveness). Measurements of the fidelity, participation,
   and responsiveness were obtained from logbooks and questionnaires.
   Fidelity was multiplied by participation to measure exposure of the
   intervention to the individual. The implementation was determined from
   optimal delivery and optimal receipt on a scale from 0 (no
   implementation) to 100 (full implementation) on individual and
   organizational level.
   Results: Out of 753 sessions, 95\% were delivered. The sessions were
   delivered with 91\% success (fidelity) across the organization. Average
   participation, fidelity, exposure, and responsiveness were 50, 93, 48,
   and 89\% across all participants. The implementation of the intervention
   was uniform across steps (p = 0.252) and workplaces (p = 0.125) but not
   for intervention components (p = 0.000). However, participation,
   fidelity, exposure, and responsiveness varied between workplaces.
   Conclusions: This study developed a quantifiable implementation
   evaluation measuring participation, fidelity, exposure, and
   responsiveness. The quantifiable implementation evaluation was suitable
   for comparing implementation across steps, components, and settings and
   can be applied in the analyses on the impact of implementation of
   complex interventions.},

Title = {An individually tailored family-centered intervention for pediatric
   obesity in primary care: study protocol of a randomized type II hybrid
   effectiveness-implementation trial (Raising Healthy Children study)},

Abstract = {Background: Pediatric obesity is a multi-faceted public health concern
   that can lead to cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and early mortality.
   Small changes in diet, physical activity, or BMI can significantly
   reduce the possibility of developing cardiometabolic risk factors.
   Family-based behavioral interventions are an underutilized,
   evidence-based approach that have been found to significantly prevent
   excess weight gain and obesity in children and adolescents. Poor program
   availability, low participation rates, and non-adherence are noted
   barriers to positive outcomes. Effective interventions for pediatric
   obesity in primary care are hampered by low family functioning,
   motivation, and adherence to recommendations.
   Methods: This (type II) hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized
   trial tests the Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health) program, which was
   designed to target health behavior change in children by improving
   family management practices and parenting skills, with the goal of
   preventing obesity and excess weight gain. The FCU4Health is assessment
   driven to tailor services and increase parent motivation. A sample of
   350 families with children aged 6 to 12 years who are identified as
   overweight or obese (BMI >= 85th percentile for age and gender) will be
   enrolled at three primary care clinics {[}two Federally Qualified
   Healthcare Centers (FQHCs) and a children's hospital]. All clinics serve
   predominantly Medicaid patients and a large ethnic minority population,
   including Latinos, African Americans, and American Indians who face
   disparities in obesity, cardiometabolic risk, and access to care. The
   FCU4Health will be coordinated with usual care, using two different
   delivery strategies: an embedded approach for the two FQHCs and a
   referral model for the hospital-based clinic. To assess program
   effectiveness (BMI, body composition, child health behaviors, parenting,
   and utilization of support services) and implementation outcomes (such
   outcomes as acceptability, adoption, feasibility, appropriateness,
   fidelity, and cost), we use a multi-method and multi-informant
   assessment strategy including electronic health record data, behavioral
   observation, questionnaires, interviews, and cost capture methods.
   Discussion: This study has the potential to prevent excess weight gain,
   obesity, and health disparities in children by establishing the
   effectiveness of the FCU4Health and collecting information critical for
   healthcare decision makers to support sustainable implementation of
   family-based programs in primary care.},

Title = {Exploring multi-level system factors facilitating educator training and
   implementation of evidence-based practices (EBP): a study protocol},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background: This study examines how system-wide (i.e., region, district,
   and school) mechanisms such as leadership support, training
   requirements, structure, collaboration, and education affect the use of
   evidence-based practices (EBPs) in schools and how this affects the
   outcomes for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite
   growing evidence for the positive effects of EBPs for ASD, these
   practices are not consistently or effectively used in schools. Although
   special education programs are mandated to use EBPs, there are very few
   evidence-based methods for selecting, implementing, and sustaining EBPs.
   Research focuses primarily on teacher training, without attention to
   contextual factors (e.g., implementation climate, attitudes toward EBPs,
   resource allocation, and social networks) that may impact outcomes.
   Using an implementation science framework, this project will
   prospectively examine relations between system-wide factors and
   teachers' use of EBPs and student education outcomes.
   Methods/design: Survey data will be collected from approximately 85
   regional special education directors, 170 regional program specialists,
   265 district special education directors, 265 behavior specialists, 925
   school principals, 3538 special education teachers, and 2700
   paraprofessionals. Administrative data for the students with ASD served
   by participating teachers will be examined. A total of 79 regional-,
   district-, and school-level personnel will also participate in social
   network interviews. Mixed methods, including surveys, administrative
   data, and observational checklists, will be used to gather in-depth
   information about system-wide malleable factors that relate to positive
   teacher implementation of EBPs and student outcomes. Multi-level
   modeling will be used to assess system-wide malleable factors related to
   EBP implementation which will be linked to the trainer, teacher, and
   student outcomes and examined based on moderators (e.g., district size,
   Special Education Local Plan Area structure, teachers' ASD experience).
   Finally, a dynamic social network approach will be used to map
   EBP-related connectivity across all levels of the system for selected
   regions. Dynamic network analysis will be used to gauge the degree to
   which and ways that EBP trainings, resources, and interventions are
   shared (or not shared) among school staff.
   Discussion: Results are expected to inform the development of
   system-wide interventions to improve the school-based implementation of
   EBPs for students with ASD.},

Abstract = {Implementing research findings into healthcare practice and policy is a
   complex process occurring in diverse contexts; it invariably depends on
   changing human behaviour in many parts of an intricate implementation
   system. Questions asked with the aim of improving implementation are
   multifarious variants of `What works, compared with what, how well, with
   what exposure, with what behaviours (for how long), for whom, in what
   setting and why?'. Relevant evidence is being published at a high rate,
   but its quantity, complexity and lack of shared terminologies present
   challenges. The achievement of efficient, effective and timely synthesis
   of evidence is facilitated by using `ontologies' to systematically
   structure and organise the evidence about constructs and their
   relationships, using a controlled, well-defined vocabulary.},

Title = {Implementation and dissemination of a transition of care program for
   rural veterans: a controlled before and after study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {Background: Adapting promising health care interventions to local
   settings is a critical component in the dissemination and implementation
   process. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) rural transitions
   nurse program (TNP) is a nurse-led, Veteran-centered intervention
   designed to improve transitional care for rural Veterans funded by VA
   national offices for dissemination to other VA sites serving a
   predominantly rural Veteran population. Here, we describe our novel
   approach to the implementation and evaluation = the TNP.
   Methods: This is a controlled before and after study that assesses both
   implementation and intervention outcomes. During pre-implementation, we
   assessed site context using a mixed method approach with data from
   diverse sources including facility-level quantitative data, key
   informant and Veteran interviews, observations of the discharge process,
   and a group brainstorming activity. We used the Practical Robust
   Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) to inform our inquiries,
   to integrate data from all sources, and to identify factors that may
   affect implementation. In the implementation phase, we will use internal
   and external facilitation, paired with audit and feedback, to encourage
   appropriate contextual adaptations. We will use a modified Stirman
   framework to document adaptations. During the evaluation phase, we will
   measure intervention and implementation outcomes at each site using the
   RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and
   Maintenance). We will conduct a difference-in-differences analysis with
   propensity-matched Veterans and VA facilities as a control. Our primary
   intervention outcome is 30-day readmission and Emergency Department
   visit rates. We will use our findings to develop an implementation
   toolkit that will inform the larger scale-up of the TNP across the VA.
   Discussion: The use of PRISM to inform pre-implementation evaluation and
   synthesize data from multiple sources, coupled with internal and
   external facilitation, is a novel approach to engaging sites in adapting
   interventions while promoting fidelity to the intervention. Our
   application of PRISM to pre-implementation and midline evaluation, as
   well as documentation of adaptations, provides an opportunity to
   identify and address contextual factors that may impede or enhance
   implementation and sustainability of health interventions and inform
   dissemination.},

Title = {The Human Behaviour-Change Project: harnessing the power of artificial

Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Background: Behaviour change is key to addressing both the challenges
   facing human health and wellbeing and to promoting the uptake of
   research findings in health policy and practice. We need to make better
   use of the vast amount of accumulating evidence from behaviour change
   intervention (BCI) evaluations and promote the uptake of that evidence
   into a wide range of contexts. The scale and complexity of the task of
   synthesising and interpreting this evidence, and increasing evidence
   timeliness and accessibility, will require increased computer support.
   The Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP) will use Artificial
   Intelligence and Machine Learning to (i) develop and evaluate a
   `Knowledge System' that automatically extracts, synthesises and
   interprets findings from BCI evaluation reports to generate new insights
   about behaviour change and improve prediction of intervention
   effectiveness and (ii) allow users, such as practitioners, policy makers
   and researchers, to easily and efficiently query the system to get
   answers to variants of the question `What works, compared with what, how
   well, with what exposure, with what behaviours (for how long), for whom,
   in what settings and why?'.
   Methods: The HBCP will: a) develop an ontology of BCI evaluations and
   their reports linking effect sizes for given target behaviours with
   intervention content and delivery and mechanisms of action, as moderated
   by exposure, populations and settings; b) develop and train an automated
   feature extraction system to annotate BCI evaluation reports using this
   ontology; c) develop and train machine learning and reasoning algorithms
   to use the annotated BCI evaluation reports to predict effect sizes for
   particular combinations of behaviours, interventions, populations and
   settings; d) build user and machine interfaces for interrogating and
   updating the knowledge base; and e) evaluate all the above in terms of
   performance and utility.
   Discussion: The HBCP aims to revolutionise our ability to synthesise,
   interpret and deliver evidence on behaviour change interventions that is
   up-to-date and tailored to user need and context. This will enhance the
   usefulness, and support the implementation of, that evidence.},

Title = {Designing an implementation intervention with the Behaviour Change Wheel
   for health provider smoking cessation care for Australian Indigenous
   pregnant women},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Background: Indigenous smoking rates are up to 80\% among pregnant
   women: prevalence among pregnant Australian Indigenous women was 45\% in
   2014, contributing significantly to the health gap for Indigenous
   Australians. We aimed to develop an implementation intervention to
   improve smoking cessation care (SCC) for pregnant Indigenous smokers, an
   outcome to be achieved by training health providers at Aboriginal
   Medical Services (AMS) in a culturally competent approach, developed
   collaboratively with AMS.
   Method: The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW), incorporating the COM-B model
   (capability, opportunity and motivation for behavioural interventions),
   provided a framework for the development of the Indigenous Counselling
   and Nicotine (ICAN) QUIT in Pregnancy implementation intervention at
   provider and patient levels. We identified evidence-practice gaps
   through (i) systematic literature reviews, (ii) a national survey of
   clinicians and (iii) a qualitative study of smoking and quitting with
   Aboriginal mothers. We followed the three stages recommended in Michie
   et al.'s ``Behaviour Change Wheel{''} guide.
   Results: Targets identified for health provider behaviour change
   included the following: capability (psychological capability, knowledge
   and skills) by training clinicians in pharmacotherapy to assist women to
   quit; motivation (optimism) by presenting evidence of effectiveness, and
   positive testimonials from patients and clinicians; and opportunity
   (environmental context and resources) by promoting a whole-of-service
   approach and structuring consultations using a flipchart and prompts.
   Education and training were selected as the main intervention functions.
   For health providers, the delivery mode was webinar, to accommodate time
   and location constraints, bringing the training to the services; for
   patients, face-to-face consultations were supported by a booklet
   embedded with videos to improve patients' capability, opportunity and
   motivation.
   Conclusions: The ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy was an intervention to train
   health providers at Aboriginal Medical Services in how to implement
   culturally competent evidence-based practice including counselling and
   nicotine replacement therapy for pregnant patients who smoke. The BCW
   aided in scientifically and systematically informing this targeted
   implementation intervention based on the identified gaps in SCC by
   health providers. Multiple factors impact at systemic, provider,
   community and individual levels. This process was therefore important
   for defining the design and intervention components, prior to a
   conducting a pilot feasibility trial, then leading on to a full clinical
   trial.},

Title = {Quality improvement, implementation, and dissemination strategies to
   improve mental health care for children and adolescents: a systematic
   review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: Some outcomes for children with mental health problems
   remain suboptimal because of poor access to care and the failure of
   systems and providers to adopt established quality improvement
   strategies and interventions with proven effectiveness. This review had
   three goals: (1) assess the effectiveness of quality improvement,
   implementation, and dissemination strategies intended to improve the
   mental health care of children and adolescents; (2) examine harms
   associated with these strategies; and (3) determine whether
   effectiveness or harms differ for subgroups based on system,
   organizational, practitioner, or patient characteristics.
   Methods: Sources included MEDLINE (R), the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO,
   and CINAHL, from database inception through February 17, 2017.
   Additional sources included gray literature, additional studies from
   reference lists, and technical experts. Two reviewers selected relevant
   randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, extracted
   data, and assessed risk of bias. Dual analysis, synthesis, and grading
   of the strength of evidence for each outcome followed for studies
   meeting inclusion criteria. We also used qualitative comparative
   analysis to examine relationships between combinations of strategy
   components and improvements in outcomes.
   Results: We identified 18 strategies described in 19 studies. Eleven
   strategies significantly improved at least one measure of intermediate
   outcomes, final health outcomes, or resource use. Moderate strength of
   evidence ( from one RCT) supported using provider financial incentives
   such as pay for performance to improve the competence with which
   practitioners can implement evidence-based practices (EBPs). We found
   inconsistent evidence involving strategies with educational meetings,
   materials, and outreach; programs appeared to be successful in
   combination with reminders or providing practitioners with newly
   collected clinical information. We also found low strength of evidence
   for no benefit for initiatives that included only educational materials
   or meetings (or both), or only educational materials and outreach
   components. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions on harms and
   moderators of interventions.
   Conclusions: Several strategies can improve both intermediate and final
   health outcomes and resource use. This complex and heterogeneous body of
   evidence does not permit us to have a high degree of confidence about
   the efficacy of any one strategy because we generally found only a
   single study testing each strategy.},

Title = {A guide to using the Theoretical Domains Framework of behaviour change
   to investigate implementation problems},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUN 21},
Abstract = {Background: Implementing new practices requires changes in the behaviour
   of relevant actors, and this is facilitated by understanding of the
   determinants of current and desired behaviours. The Theoretical Domains
   Framework (TDF) was developed by a collaboration of behavioural
   scientists and implementation researchers who identified theories
   relevant to implementation and grouped constructs from these theories
   into domains. The collaboration aimed to provide a comprehensive,
   theory-informed approach to identify determinants of behaviour. The
   first version was published in 2005, and a subsequent version following
   a validation exercise was published in 2012. This guide offers practical
   guidance for those who wish to apply the TDF to assess implementation
   problems and support intervention design. It presents a brief rationale
   for using a theoretical approach to investigate and address
   implementation problems, summarises the TDF and its development, and
   describes how to apply the TDF to achieve implementation objectives.
   Examples from the implementation research literature are presented to
   illustrate relevant methods and practical considerations.
   Methods: Researchers from Canada, the UK and Australia attended a 3-day
   meeting in December 2012 to build an international collaboration among
   researchers and decision-makers interested in the advancing use of the
   TDF. The participants were experienced in using the TDF to assess
   implementation problems, design interventions, and/or understand change
   processes. This guide is an output of the meeting and also draws on the
   authors' collective experience. Examples from the implementation
   research literature judged by authors to be representative of specific
   applications of the TDF are included in this guide.
   Results: We explain and illustrate methods, with a focus on qualitative
   approaches, for selecting and specifying target behaviours key to
   implementation, selecting the study design, deciding the sampling
   strategy, developing study materials, collecting and analysing data, and
   reporting findings of TDF-based studies. Areas for development include
   methods for triangulating data, e.g. from interviews, questionnaires and
   observation and methods for designing interventions based on TDF-based
   problem analysis.
   Conclusions: We offer this guide to the implementation community to
   assist in the application of the TDF to achieve implementation
   objectives. Benefits of using the TDF include the provision of a
   theoretical basis for implementation studies, good coverage of potential
   reasons for slow diffusion of evidence into practice and a method for
   progressing from theory-based investigation to intervention.},

Title = {Organizational theory for dissemination and implementation research},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Background: Even under optimal internal organizational conditions,
   implementation can be undermined by changes in organizations' external
   environments, such as fluctuations in funding, adjustments in
   contracting practices, new technology, new legislation, changes in
   clinical practice guidelines and recommendations, or other environmental
   shifts. Internal organizational conditions are increasingly reflected in
   implementation frameworks, but nuanced explanations of how
   organizations' external environments influence implementation success
   are lacking in implementation research. Organizational theories offer
   implementation researchers a host of existing, highly relevant, and
   heretofore largely untapped explanations of the complex interaction
   between organizations and their environment. In this paper, we
   demonstrate the utility of organizational theories for implementation
   research.
   Discussion: We applied four well-known organizational theories
   (institutional theory, transaction cost economics, contingency theories,
   and resource dependency theory) to published descriptions of efforts to
   implement SafeCare, an evidence-based practice for preventing child
   abuse and neglect. Transaction cost economics theory explained how
   frequent, uncertain processes for contracting for SafeCare may have
   generated inefficiencies and thus compromised implementation among
   private child welfare organizations. Institutional theory explained how
   child welfare systems may have been motivated to implement SafeCare
   because doing so aligned with expectations of key stakeholders within
   child welfare systems' professional communities. Contingency theories
   explained how efforts such as interagency collaborative teams promoted
   SafeCare implementation by facilitating adaptation to child welfare
   agencies' internal and external contexts. Resource dependency theory
   (RDT) explained how interagency relationships, supported by contracts,
   memoranda of understanding, and negotiations, facilitated SafeCare
   implementation by balancing autonomy and dependence on funding agencies
   and SafeCare developers.
   Summary: In addition to the retrospective application of organizational
   theories demonstrated above, we advocate for the proactive use of
   organizational theories to design implementation research. For example,
   implementation strategies should be selected to minimize transaction
   costs, promote and maintain congruence between organizations' dynamic
   internal and external contexts over time, and simultaneously attend to
   organizations' financial needs while preserving their autonomy. We
   describe implications of applying organizational theory in
   implementation research for implementation strategies, the evaluation of
   implementation efforts, measurement, research design, theory, and
   practice. We also offer guidance to implementation researchers for
   applying organizational theory.},

Title = {Using media to impact health policy-making: an integrative systematic
   review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {Introduction: Media interventions can potentially play a major role in
   influencing health policies. This integrative systematic review aimed to
   assess the effects of planned media interventions-including social
   media-on the health policy-making process.
   Methods: Eligible study designs included randomized and non-randomized
   designs, economic studies, process evaluation studies, stakeholder
   analyses, qualitative methods, and case studies. We electronically
   searched Medline, EMBASE, Communication and Mass Media Complete,
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the WHO Global
   Health Library. We followed standard systematic review methodology for
   study selection, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment.
   Results: Twenty-one studies met our eligibility criteria: 10 evaluation
   studies using either quantitative (n = 7) or qualitative (n = 3) designs
   and 11 case studies. None of the evaluation studies were on social
   media. The findings of the evaluation studies suggest that media
   interventions may have a positive impact when used as accountability
   tools leading to prioritizing and initiating policy discussions, as
   tools to increase policymakers' awareness, as tools to influence policy
   formulation, as awareness tools leading to policy adoption, and as
   awareness tools to improve compliance with laws and regulations. In one
   study, media-generated attention had a negative effect on policy
   advocacy as it mobilized opponents who defeated the passage of the bills
   that the media intervention advocated for. We judged the confidence in
   the available evidence as limited due to the risk of bias in the
   included studies and the indirectness of the evidence.
   Conclusion: There is currently a lack of reliable evidence to guide
   decisions on the use of media interventions to influence health
   policy-making. Additional and better-designed, conducted, and reported
   primary research is needed to better understand the effects of media
   interventions, particularly social media, on health policy-making
   processes, and the circumstances under which media interventions are
   successful.},

Title = {A Hybrid III stepped wedge cluster randomized trial testing an
   implementation strategy to facilitate the use of an evidence-based
   practice in VA Homeless Primary Care Treatment Programs},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: Homeless veterans often have multiple health care and
   psychosocial needs, including assistance with access to housing and
   health care, as well as support for ongoing treatment engagement. The
   Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) developed specialized Homeless
   Patient Alignment Care Teams (HPACT) with the goal of offering an
   integrated, `` one-stop program{''} to address housing and health care
   needs of homeless veterans. However, while 70\% of HPACT's veteran
   enrollees have co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders,
   HPACT does not have a uniform, embedded treatment protocol for this
   subpopulation. One wraparound intervention designed to address the needs
   of homeless veterans with co-occurring mental health and substance use
   disorders which is suitable to be integrated into HPACT clinic sites is
   the evidence-based practice called Maintaining Independence and Sobriety
   through Systems Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Veterans Edition,
   or MISSION-Vet. Despite the promise of MISSION-Vet within HPACT clinics,
   implementation of an evidence-based intervention within a busy program
   like HPACT can be difficult. The current study is being undertaken to
   identify an appropriate implementation strategy for MISSION-Vet within
   HPACT. The study will test the implementation platform called
   Facilitation and compared to implementation as usual (IU). The aims of
   this study are as follows: (1) Compare the extent to which IU or
   Facilitation strategies achieve fidelity to the MISSION-Vet intervention
   as delivered by HPACT homeless provider staff. (2) Compare the effects
   of Facilitation and IU strategies on the National HPACT Performance
   Measures. (3) Compare the effects of IU and Facilitation on the
   permanent housing status. (4) Identify and describe key stakeholders'
   (patients, providers, staff) experiences with, and perspectives on, the
   barriers to, and facilitators of implementing MISSION.
   Design: Type III Hybrid modified stepped wedge implementation comparing
   IU to Facilitation across seven HPACT teams in three sites in the
   greater Los Angeles VA system. This is a cluster randomized trial.
   Discussion: Integrating MISSION-Vet within HPACT has the potential to
   improve the health of thousands of veterans, but it is crucial to
   implement the intervention appropriately in order for it to succeed. The
   lessons learned in this protocol could assist with a larger roll-out of
   MISSION within HPACT. This protocol is registered with clinicaltrials.

Title = {Using Getting To Outcomes to facilitate the use of an evidence-based

Abstract = {Background: Incorporating evidence-based integrated treatment for dual
   disorders into typical care settings has been challenging, especially
   among those serving Veterans who are homeless. This paper presents an
   evaluation of an effort to incorporate an evidence-based, dual disorder
   treatment called Maintaining Independence and Sobriety Through Systems
   Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Veterans Edition (MISSION-Vet)
   into case management teams serving Veterans who are homeless, using an
   implementation strategy called Getting To Outcomes (GTO).
   Methods: This Hybrid Type III, cluster-randomized controlled trial
   assessed the impact of GTO over and above MISSION-Vet Implementation as
   Usual (IU). Both conditions received standard MISSION-Vet training and
   manuals. The GTO group received an implementation manual, training,
   technical assistance, and data feedback. The study occurred in teams at
   three large VA Medical Centers over 2 years. Within each team, existing
   sub-teams (case managers and Veterans they serve) were the clusters
   randomly assigned. The trial assessed MISSION-Vet services delivered and
   collected via administrative data and implementation barriers and
   facilitators, via semi-structured interview.
   Results: No case managers in the IU group initiated MISSION-Vet while
   68\% in the GTO group did. Seven percent of Veterans with case managers
   in the GTO group received at least one MISSION-Vet session. Most case
   managers appreciated the MISSION-Vet materials and felt the GTO planning
   meetings supported using MISSION-Vet. Case manager interviews also
   showed that MISSION-Vet could be confusing; there was little involvement
   from leadership after their initial agreement to participate; the data
   feedback system had a number of difficulties; and case managers did not
   have the resources to implement all aspects of MISSION-Vet.
   Conclusions: This project shows that GTO-like support can help launch
   new practices but that multiple implementation facilitators are needed
   for successful execution of a complex evidence-based program like
   MISSION-Vet.},

Title = {Methods for designing interventions to change healthcare professionals'
   behaviour: a systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Background: Systematic reviews consistently indicate that interventions
   to change healthcare professional (HCP) behaviour are haphazardly
   designed and poorly specified. Clarity about methods for designing and
   specifying interventions is needed. The objective of this review was to
   identify published methods for designing interventions to change HCP
   behaviour.
   Methods: A search of MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO was conducted from
   1996 to April 2015. Using inclusion/exclusion criteria, a broad screen
   of abstracts by one rater was followed by a strict screen of full text
   for all potentially relevant papers by three raters. An inductive
   approach was first applied to the included studies to identify
   commonalities and differences between the descriptions of methods across
   the papers. Based on this process and knowledge of related literatures,
   we developed a data extraction framework that included, e.g. level of
   change (e.g. individual versus organization); context of development; a
   brief description of the method; tasks included in the method (e.g.
   barrier identification, component selection, use of theory).
   Results: 3966 titles and abstracts and 64 full-text papers were screened
   to yield 15 papers included in the review, each outlining one design
   method. All of the papers reported methods developed within a specific
   context. Thirteen papers included barrier identification and 13 included
   linking barriers to intervention components; although not the same 13
   papers. Thirteen papers targeted individual HCPs with only one paper
   targeting change across individual, organization, and system levels. The
   use of theory and user engagement were included in 13/15 and 13/15
   papers, respectively.
   Conclusions: There is an agreement across methods of four tasks that
   need to be completed when designing individual-level interventions:
   identifying barriers, selecting intervention components, using theory,
   and engaging end-users. Methods also consist of further additional
   tasks. Examples of methods for designing the organisation and
   system-level interventions were limited. Further analysis of design
   tasks could facilitate the development of detailed guidelines for
   designing interventions.},

Title = {Multi-year school-based implementation and student outcomes of an
   evidencebased risk reduction intervention},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Background: Intervention effects observed in efficacy trials are rarely
   replicated when the interventions are broadly disseminated, underscoring
   the need for more information about factors influencing real-life
   implementation and program impact. Using data from the ongoing national
   implementation of an evidence-based HIV prevention program {[}Focus on
   Youth in The Caribbean (FOYC)] in The Bahamas, this study examines
   factors influencing teachers' patterns of implementation, the impact of
   teachers' initial implementation of FOYC, and subsequent delivery of the
   booster sessions on students' outcomes.
   Methods: Data were collected from the 80 government elementary and 34
   middle schools between 2011 and 2014, involving 208 grade 6, 75 grade 7,
   and 58 grade 8 teachers and 4411 students initially in grade 6 and
   followed for 3 years. Student outcomes include HIV/AIDS knowledge,
   reproductive health skills, self-efficacy, and intention to use
   protection. Data from teachers includes implementation and modification
   of the curriculum, attitudes towards the prevention program, comfort
   level with the curriculum, and attendance at training workshops.
   Structural equation modeling and mixed-effect modeling analyses were
   applied to examine the impact of teachers' implementation.
   Results: Teachers' attitudes towards and comfort with the intervention
   curriculum, and attendance at the curriculum training workshop had a
   direct effect on teachers' patterns of implementation, which had a
   direct effect on student outcomes. Teachers' attitudes had a direct
   positive effect on student outcomes. Teachers' training in interactive
   teaching methods and longer duration as teachers were positively
   associated with teachers' comfort with the curriculum. High-quality
   implementation in grade 6 was significantly related to student outcomes
   in grades 6 and 7 post-implementation. Level of implementation of the
   booster sessions in grades 7 and 8 were likewise significantly related
   to subsequent student outcomes in both grades.
   Conclusions: High-quality initial implementation of a prevention program
   is significantly related to better program outcomes. Poor subsequent
   delivery of booster sessions can undermine the positive effects from the
   initial implementation while strong subsequent delivery of booster
   sessions can partially overcome poor initial implementation.},

Title = {Combined use of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
   (CFIR) and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF): a systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Background: Over 60 implementation frameworks exist. Using multiple
   frameworks may help researchers to address multiple study purposes,
   levels, and degrees of theoretical heritage and operationalizability;
   however, using multiple frameworks may result in unnecessary complexity
   and redundancy if doing so does not address study needs. The
   Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the
   Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) are both well-operationalized,
   multi-level implementation determinant frameworks derived from theory.
   As such, the rationale for using the frameworks in combination (i.e.,
   CFIR + TDF) is unclear. The objective of this systematic review was to
   elucidate the rationale for using CFIR + TDF by (1) describing studies
   that have used CFIR + TDF, (2) how they used CFIR + TDF, and (2) their
   stated rationale for using CFIR + TDF.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic review to identify studies that
   mentioned both the CFIR and the TDF, were written in English, were
   peer-reviewed, and reported either a protocol or results of an empirical
   study in MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, or Google Scholar. We
   then abstracted data into a matrix and analyzed it qualitatively,
   identifying salient themes.
   Findings: We identified five protocols and seven completed studies that
   used CFIR + TDF. CFIR + TDF was applied to studies in several countries,
   to a range of healthcare interventions, and at multiple intervention
   phases; used many designs, methods, and units of analysis; and assessed
   a variety of outcomes. Three studies indicated that using CFIR + TDF
   addressed multiple study purposes. Six studies indicated that using CFIR
   + TDF addressed multiple conceptual levels. Four studies did not
   explicitly state their rationale for using CFIR + TDF.
   Conclusions: Differences in the purposes that authors of the CFIR (e.g.,
   comprehensive set of implementation determinants) and the TDF (e.g.,
   intervention development) propose help to justify the use of CFIR + TDF.
   Given that the CFIR and the TDF are both multi-level frameworks, the
   rationale that using CFIR + TDF is needed to address multiple conceptual
   levels may reflect potentially misleading conventional wisdom. On the
   other hand, using CFIR + TDF may more fully define the multi-level
   nature of implementation. To avoid concerns about unnecessary complexity
   and redundancy, scholars who use CFIR + TDF and combinations of other
   frameworks should specify how the frameworks contribute to their study.},

Title = {Evaluation of a large healthy lifestyle program: informing program
   implementation and scale-up in the prevention of obesity},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Background: The Healthy Lifestyle Program for women (HeLP-her) is a
   low-intensity, self-management program which has demonstrated efficacy
   in preventing excess weight gain in women. However, little is known
   about the implementation, reach, and sustainability of low-intensity
   prevention programs in rural settings, where risk for obesity in women
   is higher than urban settings. We aimed to evaluate a low-intensity
   healthy lifestyle program delivered to women in a rural setting to
   inform development of effective community prevention programs.
   Methods: A mixed method hybrid implementation and evaluation study,
   guided by the RE-AIM framework (addressing the Reach, Effectiveness,
   Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance), was undertaken. Data
   collection tools included anthropometric measures, program checklists,
   questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews with participants and
   local stakeholders. The RE-AIM self-audit tool was applied to assess
   evaluation rigor.
   Results: Six hundred and forty-nine women from 41 relatively
   socio-economic disadvantaged communities in Australia participated: mean
   age 39.6 years (+/- SD 6.7) and body mass index of 28.8 kg/m(2) (+/- SD
   6.9). A betweengroup weight difference of -0.92 kg (95\% CI -1.67 to
   -0.16) showed program effectiveness. Reach was broad across 41 towns
   with 62\% of participants reporting influencing some of the health
   behaviors of their families. Strong implementation fidelity was achieved
   with good retention rates at 1 year (76\%) and high participant
   satisfaction (82\% of participants willing to recommend this program).
   Over 300 multi-level community partnerships were established supporting
   high adoption. Stakeholders reported potential capacity to implement and
   sustain the prevention program in resource poor rural settings, due to
   the low-intensity design and minimal resources required.
   Conclusions: Our comprehensive RE-AIM evaluation demonstrates that an
   evidence-based obesity prevention program can be successfully
   implemented in real-world settings. The program achieved broad reach,
   effectiveness, and satisfaction at the community and stakeholder level,
   revealing potential for program sustainability. The evaluation addressed
   implementation knowledge gaps to support future obesity prevention
   program scale-up.},

Title = {Implementing international sexual counselling guidelines in hospital
   cardiac rehabilitation: development of the CHARMS intervention using the
   Behaviour Change Wheel},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: Decreased sexual activity and sexual problems are common
   among people with cardiovascular disease, negatively impacting
   relationship satisfaction and quality of life. International guidelines
   recommend routine delivery of sexual counselling to cardiac patients.
   The Cardiac Health and Relationship Management and Sexuality (CHARMS)
   baseline study in Ireland found, similar to international findings,
   limited implementation of sexual counselling guidelines in practice. The
   aim of the current study was to develop the CHARMS multi-level
   intervention to increase delivery of sexual counselling by healthcare
   professionals. We describe the methods used to develop the CHARMS
   intervention following the three phases of the Behaviour Change Wheel
   approach: understand the behaviour, identify intervention options, and
   identify content and implementation options. Survey (n = 60) and focus
   group (n = 14) data from two previous studies exploring why sexual
   counselling is not currently being delivered were coded by two members
   of the research team to understand staff's capability, opportunity, and
   motivation to engage in the behaviour. All potentially relevant
   intervention functions to change behaviour were identified and the
   APEASE (affordability, practicability, effectiveness, acceptability,
   side effects and equity) criteria were used to select the most
   appropriate. The APEASE criteria were then used to choose between all
   behaviour change techniques (BCTs) potentially relevant to the
   identified functions, and these BCTs were translated into intervention
   content. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication
   (TIDieR) checklist was used to specify details of the intervention
   including the who, what, how and where of proposed intervention
   delivery.
   Results: Providing sexual counselling group sessions by cardiac
   rehabilitation staff to patients during phase III cardiac rehabilitation
   was identified as the target behaviour. Education, enablement,
   modelling, persuasion and training were selected as appropriate
   intervention functions. Twelve BCTs, linked to intervention functions,
   were identified for inclusion and translated into CHARMS intervention
   content.
   Conclusions: This paper details the use of Behaviour Change Wheel
   approach to develop an implementation intervention in an
   under-researched area of healthcare provision. The systematic and
   transparent development of the CHARMS intervention will facilitate the
   evaluation of intervention effectiveness and future replication and
   contribute to the advancement of a cumulative science of implementation
   intervention design.},
