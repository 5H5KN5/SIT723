Abstract = {Background The Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model
   (PRISM) was developed in 2008 as a contextually expanded version of the
   broadly used Reach, Adoption, Effectiveness, Implementation, and
   Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. PRISM provides researchers a pragmatic
   and intuitive model to improve translation of research interventions
   into clinical and community practice. Since 2008, the use of PRISM
   increased across diverse topics, populations, and settings. This
   citation analysis and scoping systematic review aimed to assess the use
   of the PRISM framework and to make recommendations for future research.
   Methods A literature search was conducted using three databases (PubMed,
   Web of Science, Scopus) for the period of 2008 and September 2020. After
   exclusion, reverse citation searches and invitations to experts in the
   field were used to identify and obtain recommendations for additional
   articles not identified in the original search. Studies that integrated
   PRISM into their study design were selected for full abstraction. Unique
   research studies were abstracted for information on study
   characteristics (e.g., setting/population, design), PRISM contextual
   domains, and RE-AIM outcomes. Results A total of 180 articles were
   identified to include PRISM to some degree. Thirty-two articles
   representing 23 unique studies integrated PRISM within their study
   design. Study characteristics varied widely and included studies
   conducted in diverse contexts, but predominately in high-income
   countries and in clinical out-patient settings. With regards to use, 19
   used PRISM for evaluation, 10 for planning/development, 10 for
   implementation, four for sustainment, and one for dissemination. There
   was substantial variation across studies in how and to what degree PRISM
   contextual domains and RE-AIM outcomes were operationalized and
   connected. Only two studies directly connected individual PRISM context
   domains with RE-AIM outcomes, and another four included RE-AIM outcomes
   without direct connection to PRISM domains. Conclusions This is the
   first systematic review of the use of PRISM in various contexts. While
   there were low levels of `integrated' use of PRISM and few reports on
   linkage to RE-AIM outcomes, most studies included important context
   domains of implementation and sustainability infrastructure and external
   environment. Recommendations are provided for more consistent and
   comprehensive use of and reporting on PRISM to inform both research and
   practice on contextual factors in implementation.},

Title = {Partnered implementation of the veteran sponsorship initiative: protocol

Abstract = {Background: The USA is undergoing a suicide epidemic for its youngest
   Veterans (18-to-34-years-old) as their suicide rate has almost doubled
   since 2001. Veterans are at the highest risk during their first-year
   post-discharge, thus creating a ``deadly gap.{''} In response, the
   nation has developed strategies that emphasize a preventive, universal,
   and public health approach and embrace the value of community
   interventions. The three-step theory of suicide suggests that community
   interventions that reduce reintegration difficulties and promote
   connectedness for Veterans as they transition to civilian life have the
   greatest likelihood of reducing suicide. Recent research shows that the
   effectiveness of community interventions can be enhanced when augmented
   by volunteer and certified sponsors (1-on-1) who actively engage with
   Veterans, as part of the Veteran Sponsorship Initiative (VSI).
   Method/design: The purpose of this randomized hybrid type 2
   effectiveness-implementation trial is to evaluate the implementation of
   the VSI in six cities in Texas in collaboration with the US Departments
   of Defense, Labor and Veterans Affairs, Texas government, and local
   stakeholders. Texas is an optimal location for this large-scale
   implementation as it has the second largest population of these young
   Veterans and is home to the largest US military installation, Fort Hood.
   The first aim is to determine the effectiveness of the VSI, as evidenced
   by measures of reintegration difficulties, health/psychological
   distress, VA healthcare utilization, connectedness, and suicidal risk.
   The second aim is to determine the feasibility and potential utility of
   a stakeholder-engaged plan for implementing the VSI in Texas with the
   intent of future expansion in more states. The evaluators will use a
   stepped wedge design with a sequential roll-out to participating cities
   over time. Participants (n=630) will be enrolled on military
   installations six months prior to discharge. Implementation efforts will
   draw upon a bundled implementation strategy that includes strategies
   such as ongoing training, implementation facilitation, and audit and
   feedback. Formative and summative evaluations will be guided by the
   Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM)
   framework and will include interviews with participants and periodic
   reflections with key stakeholders to longitudinally identify barriers
   and facilitators to implementation.
   Discussion: This evaluation will have important implications for the
   national implementation of community interventions that address the
   epidemic of Veteran suicide. Aligned with the Evidence Act, it is the
   first large-scale implementation of an evidence-based practice that
   conducts a thorough assessment of TSMVs during the ``deadly gap.{''}},

Title = {Implementation strategy in collaboration with people with lived
   experience of mental illness to reduce stigma among primary care
   providers in Nepal (RESHAPE): protocol for a type 3 hybrid
   implementation effectiveness cluster randomized controlled trial},

Abstract = {Background: There are increasing efforts for the integration of mental
   health services into primary care settings in low- and middle-income
   countries. However, commonly used approaches to train primary care
   providers (PCPs) may not achieve the expected outcomes for improved
   service delivery, as evidenced by low detection rates of mental
   illnesses after training. One contributor to this shortcoming is the
   stigma among PCPs. Implementation strategies for training PCPs that
   reduce stigma have the potential to improve the quality of services.
   Design: In Nepal, a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness cluster
   randomized controlled trial will evaluate the implementation-as-usual
   training for PCPs compared to an alternative implementation strategy to
   train PCPs, entitled Reducing Stigma among Healthcare Providers
   (RESHAPE). In implementation-as-usual, PCPs are trained on the World
   Health Organization Mental Health Gap Action Program Intervention Guide
   (mhGAP-IG) with trainings conducted by mental health specialists. In
   RESHAPE, mhGAP-IG training includes the added component of facilitation
   by people with lived experience of mental illness (PWLE) and their
   caregivers using PhotoVoice, as well as aspirational figures. The
   duration of PCP training is the same in both arms. Co-primary outcomes
   of the study are stigma among PCPs, as measured with the Social Distance
   Scale at 6 months post-training, and reach, a domain from the RE-AIM
   implementation science framework. Reach is operationalized as the
   accuracy of detection of mental illness in primary care facilities and
   will be determined by psychiatrists at 3 months after PCPs diagnose the
   patients. Stigma will be evaluated as a mediator of reach.
   Cost-effectiveness and other RE-AIM outcomes will be assessed.
   Twenty-four municipalities, the unit of clustering, will be randomized
   to either mhGAP-IG implementation-as-usual or RESHAPE arms, with
   approximately 76 health facilities and 216 PCPs divided equally between
   arms. An estimated 1100 patients will be enrolled for the evaluation of
   accurate diagnosis of depression, generalized anxiety disorder,
   psychosis, or alcohol use disorder. Masking will include PCPs, patients,
   and psychiatrists.
   Discussion: This study will advance the knowledge of stigma reduction
   for training PCPs in partnership with PWLE. This collaborative approach
   to training has the potential to improve diagnostic competencies. If
   successful, this implementation strategy could be scaled up throughout
   low-resource settings to reduce the global treatment gap for mental
   illness.},

Title = {Revisiting concepts of evidence in implementation science},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {Background Evidence, in multiple forms, is a foundation of
   implementation science. For public health and clinical practice,
   evidence includes the following: type 1 evidence on etiology and burden;
   type 2 evidence on effectiveness of interventions; and type 3: evidence
   on dissemination and implementation (D\&I) within context. To support a
   vision for development and use of evidence in D\&I science that is more
   comprehensive and equitable (particularly for type 3 evidence), this
   article aims to clarify concepts of evidence, summarize ongoing debates
   about evidence, and provide a set of recommendations and tools/resources
   for addressing the ``how-to{''} in filling evidence gaps most critical
   to advancing implementation science. Main text Because current
   conceptualizations of evidence have been relatively narrow and
   insufficiently characterized in our opinion, we identify and discuss
   challenges and debates about the uses, usefulness, and gaps in evidence
   for implementation science. A set of questions is proposed to assist in
   determining when evidence is sufficient for dissemination and
   implementation. Intersecting gaps include the need to (1) reconsider how
   the evidence base is determined, (2) improve understanding of contextual
   effects on implementation, (3) sharpen the focus on health equity in how
   we approach and build the evidence-base, (4) conduct more policy
   implementation research and evaluation, and (5) learn from audience and
   stakeholder perspectives. We offer 15 recommendations to assist in
   filling these gaps and describe a set of tools for enhancing the
   evidence most needed in implementation science. Conclusions To address
   our recommendations, we see capacity as a necessary ingredient to shift
   the field's approach to evidence. Capacity includes the ``push{''} for
   implementation science where researchers are trained to develop and
   evaluate evidence which should be useful and feasible for implementers
   and reflect community or stakeholder priorities. Equally important,
   there has been inadequate training and too little emphasis on the
   ``pull{''} for implementation science (e.g., training implementers,
   practice-based research). We suggest that funders and reviewers of
   research should adopt and support a more robust definition of evidence.
   By critically examining the evolving nature of evidence, implementation
   science can better fulfill its vision of facilitating widespread and
   equitable adoption, delivery, and sustainment of scientific advances.},

Abstract = {Background: Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) is frequently used to
   inform qualitative research that aims to explain and evaluate processes
   that shape late-stage translation of innovations in the organisation and
   delivery of healthcare. A coding manual for qualitative researchers
   using NPT will facilitate transparent data analysis processes and will
   also reduce the cognitive and practical burden on researchers.
   Objectives: (a) To simplify the theory for the user. (b) To describe the
   purposes, methods of development, and potential application of a coding
   manual that translates normalisation process theory (NPT) into an easily
   usable framework for qualitative analysis. (c) To present an NPT coding
   manual that is ready for use.
   Method: Qualitative content analysis of papers and chapters that
   developed normalisation process theory, selection and structuring of
   theory constructs, and testing constructs against interview data and
   published empirical studies using NPT.
   Results: A coding manual for NPT was developed. It consists of 12
   primary NPT constructs and conforms to the Context-Mechanism-Outcome
   configuration of realist evaluation studies. Contexts are defined as
   settings in which implementation work is done, in which strategic
   intentions, adaptive execution, negotiating capability, and reframing
   organisational logics are enacted. Mechanisms are defined as the work
   that people do when they participate in implementation processes and
   include coherence-building, cognitive participation, collective action,
   and reflexive monitoring. Outcomes are defined as effects that make
   visible how things change as implementation processes proceed and
   include intervention mobilisation, normative restructuring, relational
   restructuring, and sustainment.
   Conclusion: The coding manual is ready to use and performs three
   important tasks. It consolidates several iterations of theory
   development, makes the application of NPT simpler for the user, and
   links NPT constructs to realist evaluation methods. The coding manual
   forms the core of a translational framework for implementation research
   and evaluation.},

Title = {Conceptualizing outcomes for use with the Consolidated Framework for
   Implementation Research (CFIR): the CFIR Outcomes Addendum},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background The challenges of implementing evidence-based innovations
   (EBIs) are widely recognized among practitioners and researchers.
   Context, broadly defined as everything outside the EBI, includes the
   dynamic and diverse array of forces working for or against
   implementation efforts. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation
   Research (CFIR) is one of the most widely used frameworks to guide
   assessment of contextual determinants of implementation. The original
   2009 article invited critique in recognition for the need for the
   framework to evolve. As implementation science has matured, gaps in the
   CFIR have been identified and updates are needed. Our team is developing
   the CFIR 2.0 based on a literature review and follow-up survey with
   authors. We propose an Outcomes Addendum to the CFIR to address
   recommendations from these sources to include outcomes in the framework.
   Main text We conducted a literature review and surveyed corresponding
   authors of included articles to identify recommendations for the CFIR.
   There were recommendations to add both implementation and innovation
   outcomes from these sources. Based on these recommendations, we make
   conceptual distinctions between (1) anticipated implementation outcomes
   and actual implementation outcomes, (2) implementation outcomes and
   innovation outcomes, and (3) CFIR-based implementation determinants and
   innovation determinants. Conclusion An Outcomes Addendum to the CFIR is
   proposed. Our goal is to offer clear conceptual distinctions between
   types of outcomes for use with the CFIR, and perhaps other determinant
   implementation frameworks as well. These distinctions can help bring
   clarity as researchers consider which outcomes are most appropriate to
   evaluate in their research. We hope that sharing this in advance will
   generate feedback and debate about the merits of our proposed addendum.},

Title = {Changing the preschool setting to promote healthy energy balance-related
   behaviours of preschoolers: a qualitative and quantitative process
   evaluation of the SuperFIT approach},

Abstract = {Background The Early Care and Education (ECE) setting plays an important
   role in the promotion of a healthy lifestyle in young children. SuperFIT
   is a comprehensive, integrated intervention approach designed to promote
   healthy energy balance-related behaviours in preschoolers. Insight in
   the process of implementation and the context in which SuperFIT was
   implemented supports the understanding of how the intervention works in
   practice. This process evaluation examined factors that influenced the
   implementation and maintenance, as well as the (perceived) changes in
   the ECE setting.
   Methods A mixed-methods study was conducted. SuperFIT was implemented at
   twelve preschools in the south of the Netherlands. The process
   evaluation was performed among preschool teachers, managers of the
   preschool organisation, and implementers. Semi-structured in-depth
   (group) interviews, quantitative process questionnaires, the Child-care
   Food and Activity Practices Questionnaire (CFAPQ) and the Environmental
   and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) were used to evaluate the
   implementation and maintenance of SuperFIT and the changes in the
   preschool setting. The interviews were analysed using a theoretical
   framework based on the Implementation Framework of Fleuren and
   Damschroder's Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.
   Descriptive analyses were performed on the quantitative data. Results
   Various intervention activities were implemented in the preschool
   setting. Although the intention to maintain SuperFIT was present, this
   was hindered by time constraints and lack of financial resources.
   Important factors that influenced implementation and maintenance were
   incongruence with current practice, limited perceived capabilities to
   integrate SuperFIT in daily practice, group composition at the
   preschools, and the perceived top-down implementation. Organizational
   vision and societal attention regarding healthy behaviour in general
   were perceived to be supportive for implementation and maintenance.
   Predominantly, favourable changes were seen in the nutrition- and
   physical activity-related practices of preschool teachers and other
   aspects of the social preschool environment such as the use of play
   materials. Limited changes were observed in the physical preschool
   environment.
   Conclusions Several factors influenced the implementation and
   maintenance of SuperFIT in the preschool setting. Some factors evolved
   over time from hindering to facilitating, emphasising the importance of
   allowing sufficient time for intervention implementation. SuperFIT
   changed mainly the social preschool environment.},

Abstract = {Background: The Clinical Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of
   Work-related Mental Health Conditions in General Practice (the
   Guideline) was published in 2019. The objective of this trial is to
   implement the Guideline in general practice.
   Trial design: Implementing work-related Mental health conditions in
   general PRacticE is a hybrid III, parallel cluster randomised controlled
   trial undertaken in Australia. Its primary aim is to assess the
   effectiveness of a complex intervention on the implementation of the
   Guideline in general practice. Secondary aims are to assess patient
   health and work outcomes, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the
   trial, and to develop a plan for sustainability.
   Methods: A total of 86 GP clusters will be randomly allocated either to
   the intervention arm, where they will receive a complex intervention
   comprising academic detailing, enrolment in a community of practice and
   resources, or to the control arm, where they will not receive the
   intervention. GP guideline concordance will be assessed at baseline and
   9 months using virtual simulated patient scenarios. Patients who meet
   the eligibility criteria (>18years, employed, and receiving care from a
   participating GP for a suspected or confirmed work-related mental health
   condition) will be invited to complete surveys about their health and
   work participation and provide access to their health service use data.
   Data on health service use and work participation compensation claim
   data will be combined with measures of guideline concordance and patient
   outcomes to inform an economic evaluation. A realist evaluation will be
   conducted to inform the development of a plan for sustainability.
   Results: We anticipate that GPs who receive the intervention will have
   higher guideline concordance than GPs in the control group. We also
   anticipate that higher concordance will translate to better health and
   return-to-work outcomes for patients, as well as cost-savings to
   society.
   Conclusions: The trial builds on a body of work defining the role of GPs
   in compensable injury, exploring their concerns, and developing
   evidence-based guidelines to address them. Implementation of these
   guidelines has the potential to deliver improvements in GP care, patient
   health, and return-to-work outcomes.},

Title = {Enhancing the Behaviour Change Wheel with synthesis, stakeholder
   involvement and decision-making: a case example using the `Enhancing the
   Quality of Psychological Interventions Delivered by Telephone' (EQUITy)
   research programme},

Abstract = {Background Using frameworks such as the Behaviour Change Wheel to
   develop behaviour change interventions can be challenging because
   judgement is needed at various points in the process and it is not
   always clear how uncertainties can be resolved. We propose a transparent
   and systematic three-phase process to transition from a research
   evidence base to a behaviour change intervention. The three phases
   entail evidence synthesis, stakeholder involvement and decision-making.
   We present the systematic development of an intervention to enhance the
   quality of psychological treatment delivered by telephone, as a worked
   example of this process. Method In phase 1 (evidence synthesis), we
   propose that the capabilities (C), opportunities (O) and motivations (M)
   model of behaviour change (COM-B) can be used to support the synthesis
   of a varied corpus of empirical evidence and to identify domains to be
   included in a proposed behaviour change intervention. In phase 2
   (stakeholder involvement), we propose that formal consensus procedures
   (e.g. the RAND Health/University of California-Los Angeles
   Appropriateness Methodology) can be used to facilitate discussions of
   proposed domains with stakeholder groups. In phase 3 (decision-making),
   we propose that behavioural scientists identify (with public/patient
   input) intervention functions and behaviour change techniques using the
   acceptability, practicability, effectiveness/cost-effectiveness,
   affordability, safety/side-effects and equity (APEASE) criteria. Results
   The COM-B model was a useful tool that allowed a multidisciplinary
   research team, many of whom had no prior knowledge of behavioural
   science, to synthesise effectively a varied corpus of evidence (phase 1:
   evidence synthesis). The RAND Health/University of California-Los
   Angeles Appropriateness Methodology provided a transparent means of
   involving stakeholders (patients, practitioners and key informants in
   the present example), a structured way in which they could identify
   which of 93 domains identified in phase 1 were essential for inclusion
   in the intervention (phase 2: stakeholder involvement). Phase 3
   (decision-making) was able to draw on existing Behaviour Change Wheel
   resources to revisit phases 1 and 2 and facilitate agreement among
   behavioural scientists on the final intervention modules. Behaviour
   changes were required at service, practitioner, patient and community
   levels. Conclusion Frameworks offer a foundation for intervention
   development but require additional elucidation at each stage of the
   process. The decisions adopted in this study are designed to provide an
   example on how to resolve challenges while designing a behaviour change
   intervention. We propose a three-phase process, which represents a
   transparent and systematic framework for developing behaviour change
   interventions in any setting.},

Title = {Implementation fidelity of the Systems for Person-Centered Elder Care
   (SPEC): a process evaluation study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Background: The Systems for Person-Centered Elder Care (SPEC), a complex
   intervention, was conducted to examine its effectiveness as a
   technology-enhanced, multidisciplinary, and integrated care model for
   frail older persons among ten nursing homes (NHs) in South Korea where
   formal long-term care has recently been introduced. The purpose of this
   study was to evaluate the implementation fidelity of the SPEC
   intervention and to identify moderating factors that influence the
   implementation fidelity.
   Methods: This study was a process evaluation based on an evidence-based
   framework for implementation fidelity using a mixed-methods design.
   Quantitative data from consultant logbooks, NH documentations, an
   information and communications technology (ICT) system, and a
   standardized questionnaire were collected from April 2015 to December
   2016 and analyzed by calculating the descriptive statistics.
   Semi-structured focus group interviews were held with multidisciplinary
   teams from the participating NHs. Qualitative data from a
   semi-structured questionnaire and the focus group interviews were
   analyzed using content analysis.
   Results: The SPEC program demonstrated good implementation fidelity, and
   adherence to the SPEC program was strong in all aspects, such as
   content, coverage, frequency, and duration. Of the participating on-site
   coordinators, 60\% reported that the SPEC model positively impacted
   needs assessment and the reporting system for resident care. The
   important facilitating factors were tailored facilitating strategies,
   assurance of the quality of delivery, and recruitment strategies.
   Conclusion: The effectiveness of the SPEC program was driven by good
   implementation fidelity. The key factors of good implementation fidelity
   were tailored delivery of evidence-based interventions over process
   evaluation work, facilitating strategies, and ICT support. Larger
   implementation studies with a more user-friendly ICT system are
   recommended.},

Title = {Economic evaluation of a web-based menu planning intervention to improve
   childcare service adherence with dietary guidelines},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {BackgroundDespite the known benefits of healthy eating in childhood, few
   Australian childcare services provide food that is consistent with
   dietary guidelines. The effectiveness of a web-based menu planning
   intervention to increase childcare service provision of healthy foods
   and decrease provision of discretionary foods in long day-care services
   in Australia was assessed in a randomised controlled trial. Here we
   consider the costs, consequences, cost-effectiveness and budget impact
   of the intervention using data collected within the trial.MethodsThe
   prospective trial-based economic evaluation involved 54 childcare
   services across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Services were
   randomised to a 12-month intervention or usual care. The intervention
   involved access to a web-based menu planning and decision support tool
   and online resources. Effectiveness measures included mean number of
   food groups, overall menu and individual food group compliance with
   dietary guidelines, and mean servings of food groups at 12months. Costs
   (reported in \$AUD, 2017/18) were evaluated from both health sector and
   societal perspectives. The direct cost to support uptake of the
   intervention was calculated, as were costs to each childcare service.
   The incremental cost of the intervention was calculated as the net
   difference in the cost to undertake menu planning and review plus the
   direct cost of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
   (ICERs) including uncertainty intervals were estimated for differences
   in costs and effects between intervention and control groups. A relative
   value index was calculated to determine overall value for
   money.ResultsOver the 12months of the trial, we calculated a difference
   in cost between usual practice and intervention groups of - \$482 (95\%
   UI - \$859, - \$56). While the measured increase in menu and food group
   compliance within the trial did not reach statistical significance,
   there were significant improvements in mean servings of fruit and
   discretionary food, represented in the cost-consequence analysis. The
   calculated relative value index of 1.1 suggests that the intervention
   returns acceptable value for money for the outcomes
   generated.ConclusionCompared to usual practice, web-based programmes may
   offer an efficient and sustainable alternative for childcare services to
   improve the provision of healthy foods to children in their care.Trial

Title = {The Implementation Research Logic Model: a method for planning,
   executing, reporting, and synthesizing implementation projects},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {Background Numerous models, frameworks, and theories exist for specific
   aspects of implementation research, including for determinants,
   strategies, and outcomes. However, implementation research projects
   often fail to provide a coherent rationale or justification for how
   these aspects are selected and tested in relation to one another.
   Despite this need to better specify the conceptual linkages between the
   core elements involved in projects, few tools or methods have been
   developed to aid in this task. The Implementation Research Logic Model
   (IRLM) was created for this purpose and to enhance the rigor and
   transparency of describing the often-complex processes of improving the
   adoption of evidence-based interventions in healthcare delivery systems.
   Methods The IRLM structure and guiding principles were developed through
   a series of preliminary activities with multiple investigators
   representing diverse implementation research projects in terms of
   contexts, research designs, and implementation strategies being
   evaluated. The utility of the IRLM was evaluated in the course of a
   2-day training to over 130 implementation researchers and healthcare
   delivery system partners. Results Preliminary work with the IRLM
   produced a core structure and multiple variations for common
   implementation research designs and situations, as well as guiding
   principles and suggestions for use. Results of the survey indicated a
   high utility of the IRLM for multiple purposes, such as improving rigor
   and reproducibility of projects; serving as a ``roadmap{''} for how the
   project is to be carried out; clearly reporting and specifying how the
   project is to be conducted; and understanding the connections between
   determinants, strategies, mechanisms, and outcomes for their project.
   Conclusions The IRLM is a semi-structured, principle-guided tool
   designed to improve the specification, rigor, reproducibility, and
   testable causal pathways involved in implementation research projects.
   The IRLM can also aid implementation researchers and implementation
   partners in the planning and execution of practice change initiatives.
   Adaptation and refinement of the IRLM are ongoing, as is the development
   of resources for use and applications to diverse projects, to address
   the challenges of this complex scientific field.},

Title = {Towards a comprehensive model for understanding adaptations' impact: the
   model for adaptation design and impact (MADI)},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Background: Implementation science is shifting from qualifying
   adaptations as good or bad towards understanding adaptations and their
   impact. Existing adaptation classification frameworks are largely
   descriptive (e.g., who made the adaptation) and geared towards
   researchers. They do not help practitioners in decision-making around
   adaptations (e.g., is an adaptation likely to have negative impacts?
   Should it be pursued?). Moreover, they lack constructs to consider
   ``ripple effects{''} of adaptations (i.e., both intended and unintended
   impacts on outcomes, recognizing that an adaptation designed to have a
   positive impact on one outcome may have unintended impacts on other
   outcomes). Finally, they do not specify relationships between
   adaptations and outcomes, including mediating and moderating
   relationships. The objective of our research was to promote systematic
   assessment of intended and unintended impacts of adaptations by using
   existing frameworks to create a model that proposes relationships among
   constructs.
   Materials and methods: We reviewed, consolidated, and refined constructs
   from two adaptation frameworks and one intervention-implementation
   outcome framework. Using the consolidated and refined constructs, we
   coded qualitative descriptions of 14 adaptations made to an existing
   evidence-based intervention; the 14 adaptations were designed in prior
   research by a stakeholder panel using a modified Delphi approach. Each
   of the 14 adaptations had detailed descriptions, including the nature of
   the adaptation, who made it, and its goal and reason. Using coded data,
   we arranged constructs from existing frameworks into a model, the Model
   for Adaptation Design and Impact (MADI), that identifies adaptation
   characteristics, their intended and unintended impacts (i.e., ripple
   effects), and potential mediators and moderators of adaptations' impact
   on outcomes. We also developed a decision aid and website
   (MADIguide.org) to help implementation scientists apply MADI in their
   work.
   Results and conclusions: Our model and associated decision aids build on
   existing frameworks by comprehensively characterizing adaptations,
   proposing how adaptations impact outcomes, and offering practical
   guidance for designing adaptations. MADI encourages researchers to think
   about potential causal pathways of adaptations (e.g., mediators and
   moderators) and adaptations' intended and unintended impacts on
   outcomes. MADI encourages practitioners to design adaptations in a way
   that anticipates intended and unintended impacts and leverages best
   practice from research.},

Title = {Establishing cross-systems collaborations for implementation: protocol
   for a longitudinal mixed methods study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Background: Cross-system interventions can help integrate services
   across different service delivery systems but require organizations to
   establish strong collaborative relationships for implementation.
   Contingency theory suggests that the effectiveness of different
   collaborative strategies (i.e. specific ways organizations align
   operations and services) varies by context. This paper describes a study
   of different strategies for fostering collaboration between child
   welfare and substance abuse treatment agencies and the conditions under
   which they are effective for implementation. We also describe the
   development and piloting of the Collaborating Across Systems for Program
   Implementation (CASPI) tool-a decision-making guide intended to help
   researchers and organizational leaders identify and use appropriate
   collaborative strategies for their context.
   Methods/design: This multisite longitudinal, mixed methods study,
   leverages a naturally occurring implementation initiative - in up to 17
   Ohio counties - to implement Ohio START (Sobriety Treatment and Reducing
   Trauma). START is a child welfare model that requires strong
   collaboration with local substance use treatment organizations to
   promote integrated services. During the first two years, we will
   identify collaborative strategies associated with improved START
   implementation (penetration and fidelity) and service delivery outcomes
   (timeliness), given system, and organizational features. We will conduct
   a convergent mixed methods study drawing on worker surveys, agency
   documents, administrative data, formal partner agreements, and group
   interviews. Data will be integrated and analyzed using Qualitative
   Comparative Analysis (QCA). To develop the CASPI, an expert panel
   comprised of implementation experts, and community stakeholders will
   convene to synthesize our findings and develop contents (including a
   decision tree). During the final year of the study, we will assess the
   acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the CASPI in a
   randomized vignette experiment, and a pilot-test with 3 child welfare
   agencies that have not yet implemented START.
   Discussion: Our results will lay the groundwork for a larger controlled
   trial that will test the CASPI's effectiveness for supporting effective
   and efficient implementation of cross-system interventions like START.
   The CASPI is expected to help leaders and researchers select and use
   collaboration strategies tailored to their context and be applicable in
   a wide range of settings including rural communities. Our work also
   advances system-level implementation strategies.},

Title = {The sustainability of public health interventions in schools: a
   systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {Background The sustainability of school-based health interventions after
   external funds and/or other resources end has been relatively unexplored
   in comparison to health care. If effective interventions discontinue,
   new practices cannot reach wider student populations and investment in
   implementation is wasted. This review asked: What evidence exists about
   the sustainability of school-based public health interventions? Do
   schools sustain public health interventions once start-up funds end?
   What are the barriers and facilitators affecting the sustainability of
   public health interventions in schools in high-income countries? Methods
   Seven bibliographic databases and 15 websites were searched. References
   and citations of included studies were searched, and experts and authors
   were contacted to identify relevant studies. We included reports
   published from 1996 onwards. References were screened on title/abstract,
   and those included were screened on full report. We conducted data
   extraction and appraisal using an existing tool. Extracted data were
   qualitatively synthesised for common themes, using May's General Theory
   of Implementation (2013) as a conceptual framework. Results Of the 9677
   unique references identified through database searching and other search
   strategies, 24 studies of 18 interventions were included in the review.
   No interventions were sustained in their entirety; all had some
   components that were sustained by some schools or staff, bar one that
   was completely discontinued. No discernible relationship was found
   between evidence of effectiveness and sustainability. Key facilitators
   included commitment/support from senior leaders, staff observing a
   positive impact on students' engagement and wellbeing, and staff
   confidence in delivering health promotion and belief in its value.
   Important contextual barriers emerged: the norm of prioritising
   educational outcomes under time and resource constraints, insufficient
   funding/resources, staff turnover and a lack of ongoing training.
   Adaptation of the intervention to existing routines and changing
   contexts appeared to be part of the sustainability process. Conclusions
   Existing evidence suggests that sustainability depends upon schools
   developing and retaining senior leaders and staff that are
   knowledgeable, skilled and motivated to continue delivering health
   promotion through ever-changing circumstances. Evidence of effectiveness
   did not appear to be an influential factor. However, methodologically
   stronger primary research, informed by theory, is needed.},

Abstract = {Background The PACE `Steps to Success' programme is a complex
   educational and development intervention for staff to improve palliative
   care in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). In a cluster randomized
   controlled trial, this programme has been implemented in 37 LTCFs in 7
   European countries. Alongside an effectiveness study, a process
   evaluation study was conducted. This paper reports on the results of
   this process evaluation, of which the aim was to provide a more detailed
   understanding of the implementation of the PACE Programme across and
   within countries. Methods The process evaluation followed the Reach,
   Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework
   and involved various measures and tools, including diaries for country
   trainers, evaluation questionnaires for care staff, attendance lists and
   interviews (online and face-to-face, individual and in groups) with
   country trainers, managers, PACE coordinators and other staff members.
   Based on key elements of the PACE Programme, a priori criteria for a
   high, medium and low level of the RE-AIM components Reach, Adoption,
   Implementation and intention to Maintenance were defined. Qualitative
   data on factors affecting each RE-AIM component gathered in the online
   discussion groups and interviews were analysed according to the
   principles of thematic analysis. Results The performance of the PACE
   Programme on the RE-AIM components was highly variable within and across
   countries, with a high or medium score for in total 28 (out of 37) LTCFs
   on Reach, for 26 LTCFs on Adoption, for 35 LTCFs on Implementation and
   for 34 LTCFs on intention to Maintenance. The factors affecting
   performance on the different RE-AIM components could be classified into
   three major categories: (1) the PACE Programme itself and its way of
   delivery, (2) people working with the PACE Programme and (3) contextual
   factors. Several country-specific challenges in implementing the PACE
   Programme were identified. Conclusions The implementation of the PACE
   Programme was feasible but leaves room for improvement. Our analysis
   helps to better understand the optimal levels of training and
   facilitation and provides recommendations to improve implementation in
   the LTC setting. The results of the process evaluation will be used to
   further adapt and improve the PACE Programme prior to its further
   dissemination.},

Title = {Adapting evidence-informed complex population health interventions for
   new contexts: a systematic review of guidance},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {Background Adapting interventions that have worked elsewhere can save
   resources associated with developing new interventions for each specific
   context. While a developing body of evidence shows benefits of adapted
   interventions compared with interventions transported without
   adaptation, there are also examples of interventions which have been
   extensively adapted, yet have not worked in the new context. Decisions
   on when, to what extent, and how to adapt interventions therefore are
   not straightforward, particularly when conceptualising intervention
   effects as contingent upon contextual interactions in complex systems.
   No guidance currently addresses these questions comprehensively. To
   inform development of an overarching guidance on adaptation of complex
   population health interventions, this systematic review synthesises the
   content of the existing guidance papers. Methods We searched for papers
   published between January 2000 and October 2018 in 7 bibliographic
   databases. We used citation tracking and contacted authors and experts
   to locate further papers. We double screened all the identified records.
   We extracted data into the following categories: descriptive
   information, key concepts and definitions, rationale for adaptation,
   aspects of adaptation, process of adaptation, evaluating and reporting
   adapted interventions. Data extraction was conducted independently by
   two reviewers, and retrieved data were synthesised thematically within
   pre-specified and emergent categories. Results We retrieved 6694 unique
   records. Thirty-eight papers were included in the review representing 35
   sources of guidance. Most papers were developed in the USA in the
   context of implementing evidence-informed interventions among different
   population groups within the country, such as minority populations. We
   found much agreement on how the papers defined key concepts, aims, and
   procedures of adaptation, including involvement of key stakeholders, but
   also identified gaps in scope, conceptualisation, and operationalisation
   in several categories. Conclusions Our review found limitations that
   should be addressed in future guidance on adaptation. Specifically,
   future guidance needs to be reflective of adaptations in the context of
   transferring interventions across countries, including macro- (e.g.
   national-) level interventions, better theorise the role of intervention
   mechanisms and contextual interactions in the replicability of effects
   and accordingly conceptualise key concepts, such as fidelity to
   intervention functions, and finally, suggest evidence-informed
   strategies for adaptation re-evaluation and reporting.},

Title = {Action, actor, context, target, time (AACTT): a framework for specifying

Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Background Designing implementation interventions to change the
   behaviour of healthcare providers and other professionals in the health
   system requires detailed specification of the behaviour(s) targeted for
   change to ensure alignment between intervention components and measured
   outcomes. Detailed behaviour specification can help to clarify
   evidence-practice gaps, clarify who needs to do what differently,
   identify modifiable barriers and enablers, design interventions to
   address these and ultimately provides an indicator of what to measure to
   evaluate an intervention's effect on behaviour change. An existing
   behaviour specification framework proposes four domains (Target, Action,
   Context, Time; TACT), but insufficiently clarifies who is performing the
   behaviour (i.e. the Actor). Specifying the Actor is especially important
   in healthcare settings characterised by multiple behaviours performed by
   multiple different people. We propose and describe an extension and
   re-ordering of TACT to enhance its utility to implementation
   intervention designers, practitioners and trialists: the Action, Actor,
   Context, Target, Time (AACTT) framework. We aim to demonstrate its
   application across key steps of implementation research and to provide
   tools for its use in practice to clarify the behaviours of stakeholders
   across multiple levels of the healthcare system. Methods and results We
   used French et al.'s four-step implementation process model to describe
   the potential applications of the AACTT framework for (a) clarifying who
   needs to do what differently, (b) identifying barriers and enablers, (c)
   selecting fit-for-purpose intervention strategies and components and (d)
   evaluating implementation interventions. Conclusions Describing and
   detailing behaviour using the AACTT framework may help to enhance
   measurement of theoretical constructs, inform development of topic
   guides and questionnaires, enhance the design of implementation
   interventions and clarify outcome measurement for evaluating
   implementation interventions.},

Title = {The impact of basic vs. enhanced Go NAPSACC on child care centers'
   healthy eating and physical activity practices: protocol for a type 3
   hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: To prevent childhood obesity and promote healthy
   development, health authorities recommend that child care programs use
   the evidence-based practices that foster healthy eating and physical
   habits in children. Go NAPSACC is an intervention shown to improve use
   of these recommended practices, but it is known to encounter barriers
   that limit its impact and widespread use.
   Methods: This study will use a type 3 hybrid
   effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized trial to compare
   effectiveness and implementation outcomes achieved from Go NAPSACC
   delivered with a basic or enhanced implementation approach. Participants
   will include approximately 25 coaches from Child Care Aware of Kentucky
   (serving four geographic regions), 97 child care centers with a director
   and teacher from each and two cross-sectional samples of 485
   3-4-year-old children (one recruitment at baseline, another at
   follow-up). Coaches will be randomly assigned to deliver Go NAPSACC
   using either the basic or enhanced implementation approach. ``Basic Go
   NAPSACC{''} represents the traditional way of delivering Go NAPSACC.
   ``Enhanced Go NAPSACC{''} incorporates preparatory and support
   activities before and during their Go NAPSACC work, which are guided by
   the Quality Implementation Framework and the Consolidated Framework for
   Implementation Research. Data will be collected primarily at baseline
   and post-intervention, with select measures continuing through 6, 12,
   and 24 months postintervention. Guided largely by RE-AIM, outcomes will
   assess change in centers' use of evidence-based nutrition and physical
   activity practices (primary, measured via observation); centers'
   adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the Go NAPSACC program
   (assessed via website use); center directors', teachers', and coaches'
   perceptions of contextual factors (assessed via self-report surveys);
   children's eating and physical activity behaviors at child care
   (measured via observation and accelerometers); and cost-effectiveness
   (assessed via logs and expense tracking). The hypotheses anticipate that
   ``Enhanced Go NAPSACC{''} will have greater effects than ``Basic Go
   NAPSACC.{''}
   Discussion: This study incorporates many lessons gleaned from the
   growing implementation science field, but also offers opportunities to
   address the field's research priorities, including applying a systematic
   method to tailor implementation strategies, examining the processes and
   mechanisms through which implementation strategies produce their
   effects, and conducting an economic evaluation of implementation
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Background Designing implementation research can be a complex and
   daunting task, especially for applied health researchers who have not
   received specialist training in implementation science. We developed the
   Implementation Science Research Development (ImpRes) tool and
   supplementary guide to address this challenge and provide researchers
   with a systematic approach to designing implementation research. Methods
   A multi-method and multi-stage approach was employed. An international,
   multidisciplinary expert panel engaged in an iterative brainstorming and
   consensus-building process to generate core domains of the ImpRes tool,
   representing core implementation science principles and concepts that
   researchers should consider when designing implementation research.
   Simultaneously, an iterative process of reviewing the literature and
   expert input informed the development and content of the tool. Once
   consensus had been reached, specialist expert input was sought on
   involving and engaging patients/service users; and economic evaluation.
   ImpRes was then applied to 15 implementation and improvement science
   projects across the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)
   Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care
   (CLAHRC) South London, a research organisation in London, UK.
   Researchers who applied the ImpRes tool completed an 11-item
   questionnaire evaluating its structure, content and usefulness. Results
   Consensus was reached on ten implementation science domains to be
   considered when designing implementation research. These include
   implementation theories, frameworks and models, determinants of
   implementation, implementation strategies, implementation outcomes and
   unintended consequences. Researchers who used the ImpRes tool found it
   useful for identifying project areas where implementation science is
   lacking (median 5/5, IQR 4-5) and for improving the quality of
   implementation research (median 4/5, IQR 4-5) and agreed that it
   contained the key components that should be considered when designing
   implementation research (median 4/5, IQR 4-4). Qualitative feedback from
   researchers who applied the ImpRes tool indicated that a supplementary
   guide was needed to facilitate use of the tool. Conclusions We have
   developed a feasible and acceptable tool, and supplementary guide, to
   facilitate consideration and incorporation of core principles and
   concepts of implementation science in applied health implementation
   research. Future research is needed to establish whether application of
   the tool and guide has an effect on the quality of implementation
   research.},

Title = {The FRAME: an expanded framework for reporting adaptations and
   modifications to evidence-based interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {BackgroundThis paper describes the process and results of a refinement
   of a framework to characterize modifications to interventions. The
   original version did not fully capture several aspects of modification
   and adaptation that may be important to document and report.
   Additionally, the earlier framework did not include a way to
   differentiate cultural adaptation from adaptations made for other
   reasons. Reporting additional elements will allow for a more precise
   understanding of modifications, the process of modifying or adapting,
   and the relationship between different forms of modification and
   subsequent health and implementation outcomes.DiscussionWe employed a
   multifaceted approach to develop the updated FRAME involving coding
   documents identified through a literature review, rapid coding of
   qualitative interviews, and a refinement process informed by multiple
   stakeholders. The updated FRAME expands upon Stirman et al.'s original
   framework by adding components of modification to report: (1) when and
   how in the implementation process the modification was made, (2) whether
   the modification was planned/proactive (i.e., an adaptation) or
   unplanned/reactive, (3) who determined that the modification should be
   made, (4) what is modified, (5) at what level of delivery the
   modification is made, (6) type or nature of context or content-level
   modifications, (7) the extent to which the modification is
   fidelity-consistent, and (8) the reasons for the modification, including
   (a) the intent or goal of the modification (e.g., to reduce costs) and
   (b) contextual factors that influenced the decision. Methods of using
   the framework to assess modifications are outlined, along with their
   strengths and weaknesses, and considerations for research to validate
   these measurement strategies.ConclusionThe updated FRAME includes
   consideration of when and how modifications occurred, whether it was
   planned or unplanned, relationship to fidelity, and reasons and goals
   for modification. This tool that can be used to support research on the
   timing, nature, goals and reasons for, and impact of modifications to
   evidence-based interventions.},

Title = {Using implementation facilitation to implement primary care mental

   protocol for a hybrid type 2 cluster randomized stepped-wedge design},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {BackgroundIntegrating mental health providers into primary care clinics
   improves access to and outcomes of mental health care. In the Veterans
   Health Administration (VA) Primary Care Mental Health Integration
   (PCMHI) program, mental health providers are co-located in primary care
   clinics, but the implementation of this model is challenging outside
   large VA medical centers, especially for rural clinics without full
   mental health staffing. Long wait times for mental health care, little
   collaboration between mental health and primary care providers, and
   sub-optimal outcomes for rural veterans could result. Telehealth could
   be used to provide PCMHI to rural clinics; however, the clinical
   effectiveness of the tele-PCMHI model has not been tested. Based on
   evidence that implementation facilitation is an effective implementation
   strategy to increase uptake of PCMHI when delivered on-site at larger VA
   clinics, it is hypothesized that this strategy may also be effective
   with regard to ensuring adequate uptake of the tele-PCMHI model at rural
   VA clinics.MethodsThis study is a hybrid type 2 pragmatic
   effectiveness-implementation trial of tele-PCMHI in six sites over
   24months. Tele-PCMHI, which will be delivered by clinical staff
   available in routine care settings, will be compared to usual care.
   Fidelity to the care model will be monitored but not controlled. We will
   use the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM)
   framework to evaluate the patient-level clinical effectiveness of
   tele-PCMHI in rural VA clinics and also to evaluate the fidelity to and
   outcomes of the implementation strategy, implementation facilitation.
   The proposed study will employ a stepped-wedge design in which study
   sites sequentially begin implementation in three steps at 6-month
   intervals. Each step will include (1) a 6-month period of implementation
   planning, followed by (2) a 6-month period of active implementation, and
   (3) a final period of stepped-down implementation
   facilitation.DiscussionThis study will evaluate the effectiveness of
   PCMHI in a novel setting and via a novel method (clinical video
   telehealth). We will test the feasibility of using implementation
   facilitation as an implementation strategy to deploy tele-PCMHI in rural
   VA clinics.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov registration number

Abstract = {BackgroundAlignment across levels of leadership within an organization
   is needed for successful implementation of evidence-based practice. The
   leadership and organizational change for implementation (LOCI)
   intervention is a multi-faceted multilevel implementation strategy
   focusing on enhancing first-level general and implementation leadership
   while also engaging with organization upper management to develop an
   organizational climate for implementation. The aim of the project is to
   evaluate the effectiveness of LOCI in supporting the implementation of
   evidence-based treatment for PTSD in child- and adult-specialized mental
   health clinics in health trusts in Norway.MethodsThe study design is a
   stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial with enrollment of clinics in
   three cohorts. Executives, clinic leaders, and therapists will be asked
   to complete surveys assessing leadership and implementation climate.
   Surveys will be completed at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20months.
   Results from surveys will be shared with executives and clinic leaders
   to inform the subsequent creation of tailored leadership and climate
   development plans for enhanced implementation. Patients will complete
   surveys measuring traumatic events and post-traumatic stress symptoms
   during the therapy process. Therapy sessions will be audio or video
   recorded and scored for fidelity as part of training.DiscussionThis
   study aims to provide knowledge on how to improve leadership and
   organizational climate to enhance effective implementation of
   evidence-based treatments in mental health services.Trial

Abstract = {Background: While it is recommended that childcare services implement
   policies and practices to support obesity prevention, there remains
   limited evidence to inform policy and practice. The aim of this study is
   to examine the effectiveness of performance review and facilitated
   feedback in increasing the implementation of healthy eating and physical
   activity-promoting policies and practices in childcare services.
   Methods: The study was conducted with childcare services in the Hunter
   New England region of New South Wales, Australia. Eligible services were
   randomised to a wait-list control group or to receive the implementation
   strategy. The strategy targeted the implementation of written nutrition,
   physical activity, and small screen recreation policies; providing
   information to families regarding healthy eating, physical activity, and
   small screen time; providing twice weekly healthy eating learning
   experiences to children; providing water and plain milk only to
   children; providing fundamental movement skills activities for children
   every day; and limiting the use of electronic screen time for
   educational purposes and learning experiences. Intervention services
   received a performance review and facilitated feedback process five
   times over the 10 months that included an assessment of current
   practices, goal setting, identification of barriers to implementation,
   problem-solving, and resource provision. The primary outcome was the
   proportion of services implementing all six policies and practices,
   assessed by nominated supervisor completion of a computer-assisted
   telephone interview at baseline and 12-month follow-up.
   Results: One hundred and eight services took part. There were no
   significant differences in the proportion of services implementing all
   six practices at 12 months (mean difference 0.51; 95\% CI 0.16 to 1.58;
   p = 0.24). There were also no differences between groups in the mean
   number of policies and practices implemented (mean difference 0.1; 95\%
   CI -0.4 to 0.6; p = 0.71), or the proportion implementing each of the
   six individual policies and practices at 12 months (OR range 0.57 to
   1.85; p > 0.05).
   Conclusions: Further support may be required to assist childcare

Title = {Intermediary/purveyor organizations for evidence-based interventions in
   the US child mental health: characteristics and implementation
   strategies},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {BackgroundMany psychosocial interventions are disseminated and supported
   by organizations, termed Intermediary/Purveyor Organizations (IPOs).
   Because IPOs remain largely unstudied, we lack understanding of their
   scale and the strategies they utilize. The role and function of
   organizations that link resource systems with user systems, such as
   IPOs, have been identified as an important but understudied issue in
   implementation science. The objectives of this paper are to describe
   features of IPOs that disseminate evidence-based interventions (EBIs)
   for child behavioral health and identify the strategies they use to
   support their implementation.MethodsThe Substance Abuse and Mental
   Health Services (SAMHSA) National Registry of Evidence-based Programs
   and Practices (NREPP) listed 119 unique IPOs for the 127 child
   behavioral health EBIs listed on its website. Data characterizing each
   organization were drawn from NREPP and GuideStar profiles. From 119
   unique IPOs identified, we found contact information for 108. We sent an
   electronic survey to capture additional organizational information and
   implementation strategies the IPOs employed in spreading the EBIs;
   response rate was 50\%. Data are presented descriptively and analyzed
   using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and Latent Class Analysis
   (LCA).ResultsVirtually all identified EBIs had an IPO. IPOs train
   individuals, organizations, and communities and provide supervision for
   the use of EBIs. About 20\% of IPOs trained at large scale, some
   training 500-1000+ providers annually. IPOs reported using an average of
   32 distinct strategies to implement their EBIs, with most using
   educational, planning, and quality improvement strategies. However,
   there was little convergence around strategy helpfulness. The only
   significant predictor of number of strategies used by an IPO was the
   NREPP-posted implementation readiness score of the intervention. LCA
   revealed that IPOs either used several implementation strategies or used
   very few.ConclusionsFindings add significantly to knowledge about IPO
   structure, scale, and function. They use numerous and varying
   implementation strategies but report little consensus in what works. The
   study advances methods for measuring and characterizing real-world
   implementation by demonstrating the feasibility of using a common
   nomenclature, per a published compilation and of LCA for data reduction
   in characterizing profiles of implementation approaches.},

Title = {Developing an evidence-based program sustainability training curriculum:
   a group randomized, multi-phase approach},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Background: The emergence of dissemination and implementation (D\&I)
   science has driven a rapid increase in studies of how new scientific
   discoveries are translated and developed into evidence-based programs
   and policies. However, D\&I science has paid much less attention to what
   happens to programs once they have been implemented. Public health
   programs can only deliver benefits if they reach maturity and sustain
   activities over time. In order to achieve the full benefits of
   significant investment in public health research and program
   development, there must be an understanding of the factors that relate
   to sustainability to inform development of tools and trainings to
   support strategic long-term program sustainability. Tobacco control
   programs, specifically, vary in their abilities to support and sustain
   themselves over time. As of 2018, most states still do not meet the
   CDC-recommended level for funding their TC program, allowing tobacco use
   to remain the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the USA.
   The purpose of this study is to empirically develop, test, and
   disseminate training programs to improve the sustainability of
   evidence-based state tobacco control programs and thus, tobacco-related
   health outcomes.
   Methods: This paper describes the methods of a group randomized,
   multi-phase study that evaluates the empirically developed ``Program
   Sustainability Action Planning Training{''} and technical assistance in
   US state-level tobacco control programs. Phase 1 includes developing the
   sustainability action planning training curriculum and technical
   assistance protocol and developing measures to assess long-term program
   sustainability. Phase 2 includes a group randomized trial to test the
   effectiveness of the training and technical assistance in improving
   sustainability outcomes in 24 state tobacco control programs (12
   intervention, 12 comparison). Phase 3 includes the active dissemination
   of final training curricula materials to a broader public health
   audience.
   Discussion: Empirical evidence has established that program
   sustainability can improve through training and technical assistance;
   however, to our knowledge, no evidence-based sustainability training
   curriculum program exists. Therefore, systematic methods are needed to
   develop, test, and disseminate a training that improves the
   sustainability of evidence-based programs.},

Title = {Protocol for the ROSE sustainment (ROSES) study, a sequential multiple
   assignment randomized trial to determine the minimum necessary
   intervention to maintain a postpartum depression prevention program in
   prenatal clinics serving low-income women},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Background: More research on sustainment of interventions is needed,
   especially return on investment (ROI) studies to determine cost-benefit
   trade-offs for effort required to sustain and how much is gained when
   effective programs are sustained. The ROSE sustainment (ROSES) study
   uses a sequential multiple assignment randomized (SMART) design to
   evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a stepwise approach
   to sustainment of the ROSE postpartum depression prevention program in
   90 outpatient clinics providing prenatal care to pregnant women on
   public assistance. Postpartum depression (PPD) is common and can have
   lasting consequences. Outpatient clinics offering prenatal care are an
   opportune place to provide PPD prevention because most women visit while
   pregnant The ROSE (Reach Out Stay Strong, Essentials for mothers of
   newborns) program is a group educational intervention to prevent PPD,
   delivered during pregnancy. ROSE has been found to reduce cases of PPD
   in community prenatal settings serving low-income pregnant women.
   Methods: All 90 prenatal clinics will receive enhanced implementation as
   usual (EIAU; initial training + tools for sustainment). At the first
   time at which a clinic is determined to be at risk for failure to
   sustain (i.e., at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months), that clinic will be
   randomized to receive either (1) no additional implementation support
   (i.e., EIAU only), or (2) low-intensity coaching and feedback (LICF). If
   clinics receiving LICF are still at risk at subsequent assessments, they
   will be randomized to either (1) EIAU + LICF only, or (2) high-intensity
   coaching and feedback (HICF). Additional follow-up interviews will occur
   at 18, 24, and 30 months, but no implementation intervention will occur
   after 18 months. Outcomes include (1) percent sustainment of core
   program elements at each time point (2) health impact (PPD rates over
   time at each clinic) and reach, and (3) ROI (costs and
   cost-effectiveness) of each sustainment step. Hypothesized mechanisms
   include sustainment of capacity to deliver core elements and
   engagement/ownership.
   Discussion: This study is the first randomized trial evaluating the ROI
   of a stepped approach to sustainment a critical unanswered question in
   implementation science. It will also a dvance knowledge of
   implementation mechanisms and clinical care for an at-risk population.},

   limited. Implementation strategies addressing barriers to such care may
   be effective in increasing care provision. The aim of this study is to
   examine the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of a
   multi-strategy practice change intervention in increasing antenatal care
   addressing the consumption of alcohol by pregnant women.
   Methods: The study will be a randomised, stepped-wedge controlled trial
   conducted in three sectors in a health district in New South Wales,
   Australia. Stepped implementation of a practice change intervention will
   be delivered to sectors in a random order to support the introduction of
   a model of care for addressing alcohol consumption by pregnant women. A
   staged process was undertaken to develop the implementation strategies,
   which comprise of: leadership support, local clinical practice
   guidelines, electronic prompts and reminders, opinion leaders, academic
   detailing (audit and feedback), educational meetings and educational
   materials, and performance monitoring. Repeated cross-sectional outcome
   data will be gathered weekly across all sectors for the study duration.
   The primary outcome measures are the proportion of antenatal
   appointments at `booking in', 27-28 weeks gestation and 35-36 weeks
   gestation for which women report (1) being assessed for alcohol
   consumption, (2) being provided with brief advice related to alcohol
   consumption during pregnancy, (3) receiving relevant care for addressing
   alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and (4) being assessed for alcohol
   consumption and receiving relevant care. Data on resources expended
   during intervention development and implementation will be collected.
   The proportion of women who report consuming alcohol since knowing they
   were pregnant will be measured as a secondary outcome.
   Discussion: This will be the first randomised controlled trial to
   evaluate the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of
   implementation strategies in improving antenatal care that addresses
   alcohol consumption by pregnant women. If positive changes in clinical
   practice are found, this evidence will support health service adoption
   of implementation strategies to support improved antenatal care for this
   recognised risk to the health and wellbeing of the mother and child.},

Title = {Using Normalization Process Theory in feasibility studies and process
   evaluations of complex healthcare interventions: a systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Background: Normalization Process Theory (NPT) identifies, characterises
   and explains key mechanisms that promote and inhibit the implementation,
   embedding and integration of new health techniques, technologies and
   other complex interventions. A large body of literature that employs NPT
   to inform feasibility studies and process evaluations of complex
   healthcare interventions has now emerged. The aims of this review were
   to review this literature; to identify and characterise the uses and
   limits of NPT in research on the implementation and integration of
   healthcare interventions; and to explore NPT's contribution to
   understanding the dynamics of these processes.
   Methods: A qualitative systematic review was conducted. We searched Web
   of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar for articles with empirical data
   in peer-reviewed journals that cited either key papers presenting and
   developing NPT, or the NPT Online Toolkit
   (www.normalizationprocess.org). We included in the review only articles
   that used NPT as the primary approach to collection, analysis or
   reporting of data in studies of the implementation of healthcare
   techniques, technologies or other interventions. A structured data
   extraction instrument was used, and data were analysed qualitatively.
   Results: Searches revealed 3322 citations. We show that after
   eliminating 2337 duplicates and broken or junk URLs, 985 were screened
   as titles and abstracts. Of these, 101 were excluded because they did
   not fit the inclusion criteria for the review. This left 884 articles
   for full-text screening. Of these, 754 did not fit the inclusion
   criteria for the review. This left 130 papers presenting results from
   108 identifiable studies to be included in the review. NPT appears to
   provide researchers and practitioners with a conceptual vocabulary for
   rigorous studies of implementation processes. It identifies,
   characterises and explains empirically identifiable mechanisms that
   motivate and shape implementation processes. Taken together, these mean
   that analyses using NPT can effectively assist in the explanation of the
   success or failure of specific implementation projects. Ten percent of
   papers included critiques of some aspect of NPT, with those that did
   mainly focusing on its terminology. However, two studies critiqued NPT
   emphasis on agency, and one study critiqued NPT for its normative focus.
   Conclusions: This review demonstrates that researchers found NPT useful
   and applied it across a wide range of interventions. It has been
   effectively used to aid intervention development and implementation
   planning as well as evaluating and understanding implementation
   processes themselves. In particular, NPT appears to have offered a
   valuable set of conceptual tools to aid understanding of implementation
   as a dynamic process.},

Title = {``I had to somehow still be flexible{''}: exploring adaptations during
   implementation of brief cognitive behavioral therapy in primary care},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Background: Primary care clinics present challenges to implementing
   evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) for depression and anxiety, and
   frontline providers infrequently adopt these treatments. The current
   study explored providers' perspectives on fidelity to a manualized brief
   cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as delivered in primary care clinics
   as part of a pragmatic randomized trial. Data from the primary study
   demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of the treatment and indicated
   that providers delivered brief CBT with high fidelity, as evaluated by
   experts using a standardized rating form. Data presented here explore
   challenges providers faced during implementation and how they adapted
   nonessential intervention components to make the protocol ``fit{''} into
   their clinical practice.
   Methods: A multiprofessional group of providers (n = 18) completed a
   one-time semi-structured interview documenting their experiences using
   brief CBT in the primary care setting. Data were analyzed via directed
   content analysis, followed by inductive sorting of interview excerpts to
   identify key themes agreed upon by consensus. The Dynamic Adaptation
   Process model provided an overarching framework to allow better
   understanding and contextualization of emergent themes.
   Results: Providers described a variety of adaptations to the brief CBT
   to better enable its implementation. Adaptations were driven by provider
   skills and abilities (i.e., using flexible content and delivery options
   to promote treatment engagement), patient-emergent issues (i.e.,
   addressing patients' broader life and clinical concerns), and
   system-level resources (i.e., maximizing the time available to provide
   treatment).
   Conclusions: The therapeutic relationship, individual patient factors,
   and system-level factors were critical drivers guiding how providers
   adapted EBP delivery to improve the ``fit{''} into their clinical
   practice. Adaptations were generally informed by tensions between the
   EBP protocol and patient and system needs and were largely not addressed
   in the EBP protocol itself. Adaptations were generally viewed as
   acceptable by study fidelity experts and helped to more clearly define
   delivery procedures to improve future implementation efforts. It is
   recommended that future EBP implementation efforts examine the concept
   of fidelity on a continuum rather than dichotomized as adherent/not
   adherent with focused efforts to understand the context of EBP delivery.},

Title = {Implementation of a community-based intervention in the most rural and
   remote districts of Zambia: a process evaluation of safe motherhood
   action groups},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Background: A community-based intervention known as Safe Motherhood
   Action Groups (SMAGs) was implemented to increase coverage of maternal
   and neonatal health (MNH) services among the poorest and most remote
   populations in Zambia. While the outcome evaluation demonstrated
   statistically significant improvement in the MNH indicators, targets for
   key indicators were not achieved, and reasons for this shortfall were
   not known This study was aimed at understanding why the targeted key
   indicators for MNH services were not achieved
   Methods: A process evaluation, in accordance with the Medical Research
   Council (MRC) framework, was conducted in two selected rural districts
   of Zambia using qualitative approaches Focus group discussions were
   conducted with SMAGs, volunteer community health workers, and mothers
   and in-depth interviews with healthcare providers. Content analysis was
   done.
   Results: We found that SMAGs implemented much of the intervention as was
   intended, particularly in the area of women's education and referral to
   health facilities for skilled MNH services. The SMAGs went beyond their
   prescribed roles to assist women with household chores and personal
   problems and used their own resources to enhance the success of the
   intervention. Deficiencies in the intervention were reported and
   included poor ongoing support, inadequate supplies and lack of effective
   transportation such as bicycles needed for the SMAGs to facilitate then
   work. Factors external to the intervention, such as inadequacy of health
   services and skilled healthcare providers in facilities where SMAGs
   referred mothers and pool geographical access, may have led SMAGs to
   engage in the unintended role of conducting deliveries, thus
   compromising the outcome of the intervention
   Conclusion: We found evidence suggesting that although SMAGs continue to
   play prvotal roles in contribution towards accelerated coverage of MNH
   services among hard to reach populations, they are unable to meet some
   of the critical sets of MNH service targeted indicators The complexities
   of the implementation mechanisms coupled with the presence of setting
   specific socio cultural and geographical contextual factors could
   partially explain this failure. This suggests a need for innovating
   existing implementation strategies so as to help SMAGs and any other
   community health system champions to effectively respond to MNH needs of
   most at risk women and promote universal health coverage targeting
   hard-to-reach groups.},

Title = {To what extent can behaviour change techniques be identified within an
   adaptable implementation package for primary care? A prospective
   directed content analysis},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Background: Interpreting evaluations of complex interventions can be
   difficult without sufficient description of key intervention content. We
   aimed to develop an implementation package for primary care which could
   be delivered using typically available resources and could be adapted to
   target determinants of behaviour for each of four quality indicators:
   diabetes control, blood pressure control, anticoagulation for atrial
   fibrillation and risky prescribing. We describe the development and
   prospective verification of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) embedded
   within the adaptable implementation packages.
   Methods: We used an over-lapping multi-staged process. We identified
   evidence-based, candidate delivery mechanisms-mainly audit and feedback,
   educational outreach and computerised prompts and reminders. We drew
   upon interviews with primary care professionals using the Theoretical
   Domains Framework to explore likely determinants of adherence to quality
   indicators. We linked determinants to candidate BCTs. With input from
   stakeholder panels, we prioritised likely determinants and intervention
   content prior to piloting the implementation packages. Our content
   analysis assessed the extent to which embedded BCTs could be identified
   within the packages and compared them across the delivery mechanisms and
   four quality indicators.
   Results: Each implementation package included at least 27 out of 30
   potentially applicable BCTs representing 15 of 16 BCT categories. Whilst
   23 BCTs were shared across all four implementation packages (e.g. BCTs
   relating to feedback and comparing behaviour), some BCTs were unique to
   certain delivery mechanisms (e.g. `graded tasks' and `problem solving'
   for educational outreach). BCTs addressing the determinants
   `environmental context' and `social and professional roles' (e.g.
   `restructuring the social and `physical environment' and `adding objects
   to the environment') were indicator specific. We found it challenging to
   operationalise BCTs targeting `environmental context', `social
   influences' and `social and professional roles' within our chosen
   delivery mechanisms.
   Conclusion: We have demonstrated a transparent process for selecting,
   operationalising and verifying the BCT content in implementation
   packages adapted to target four quality indicators in primary care.
   There was considerable overlap in BCTs identified across the four
   indicators suggesting core BCTs can be embedded and verified within
   delivery mechanisms commonly available to primary care. Whilst feedback
   reports can include a wide range of BCTs, computerised prompts can
   deliver BCTs at the time of decision making, and educational outreach
   can allow for flexibility and individual tailoring in delivery.},

Title = {Operationalizing a model to quantify implementation of a multi-component
   intervention in a stepped-wedge trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {Background: It is challenging to interpret the results of multifaceted
   interventions due to complex program theories that are difficult to
   measure in a quantifiable manner. The aims of this paper were, first, to
   develop a model for a comprehensive quantitative implementation
   evaluation and, second, to operationalize it in the process evaluation
   of the stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial: ``Prevention
   of low back pain and its consequences among nurses' aides in elderly
   care{''} to investigate if implementation differed across intervention
   components, steps, and settings (workplaces).
   Methods: Operationalization of a quantifiable measure of implementation
   requires three steps: (1) development of a program logic and
   intervention protocol, (2) description of a complete and acceptable
   delivery of the intervention, and (3) description of what determines the
   receipt of the intervention. Program logic from a previously developed
   multifaceted stepped-wedge intervention was used. The optimal delivery
   of the intervention was defined as the deliverers' full understanding
   and following of the intervention protocol and that they performed their
   best and contributed to the participants' attention and motivation
   (fidelity). The optimal receipt of the intervention was defined as
   participants being fully present at all intervention activities
   (participation), being motivated and satisfied, and having a good social
   support (responsiveness). Measurements of the fidelity, participation,
   and responsiveness were obtained from logbooks and questionnaires.
   Fidelity was multiplied by participation to measure exposure of the
   intervention to the individual. The implementation was determined from
   optimal delivery and optimal receipt on a scale from 0 (no
   implementation) to 100 (full implementation) on individual and
   organizational level.
   Results: Out of 753 sessions, 95\% were delivered. The sessions were
   delivered with 91\% success (fidelity) across the organization. Average
   participation, fidelity, exposure, and responsiveness were 50, 93, 48,
   and 89\% across all participants. The implementation of the intervention
   was uniform across steps (p = 0.252) and workplaces (p = 0.125) but not
   for intervention components (p = 0.000). However, participation,
   fidelity, exposure, and responsiveness varied between workplaces.
   Conclusions: This study developed a quantifiable implementation
   evaluation measuring participation, fidelity, exposure, and
   responsiveness. The quantifiable implementation evaluation was suitable
   for comparing implementation across steps, components, and settings and
   can be applied in the analyses on the impact of implementation of
   complex interventions.},

Title = {An individually tailored family-centered intervention for pediatric
   obesity in primary care: study protocol of a randomized type II hybrid
   effectiveness-implementation trial (Raising Healthy Children study)},

Abstract = {Background: Pediatric obesity is a multi-faceted public health concern
   that can lead to cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and early mortality.
   Small changes in diet, physical activity, or BMI can significantly
   reduce the possibility of developing cardiometabolic risk factors.
   Family-based behavioral interventions are an underutilized,
   evidence-based approach that have been found to significantly prevent
   excess weight gain and obesity in children and adolescents. Poor program
   availability, low participation rates, and non-adherence are noted
   barriers to positive outcomes. Effective interventions for pediatric
   obesity in primary care are hampered by low family functioning,
   motivation, and adherence to recommendations.
   Methods: This (type II) hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized
   trial tests the Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health) program, which was
   designed to target health behavior change in children by improving
   family management practices and parenting skills, with the goal of
   preventing obesity and excess weight gain. The FCU4Health is assessment
   driven to tailor services and increase parent motivation. A sample of
   350 families with children aged 6 to 12 years who are identified as
   overweight or obese (BMI >= 85th percentile for age and gender) will be
   enrolled at three primary care clinics {[}two Federally Qualified
   Healthcare Centers (FQHCs) and a children's hospital]. All clinics serve
   predominantly Medicaid patients and a large ethnic minority population,
   including Latinos, African Americans, and American Indians who face
   disparities in obesity, cardiometabolic risk, and access to care. The
   FCU4Health will be coordinated with usual care, using two different
   delivery strategies: an embedded approach for the two FQHCs and a
   referral model for the hospital-based clinic. To assess program
   effectiveness (BMI, body composition, child health behaviors, parenting,
   and utilization of support services) and implementation outcomes (such
   outcomes as acceptability, adoption, feasibility, appropriateness,
   fidelity, and cost), we use a multi-method and multi-informant
   assessment strategy including electronic health record data, behavioral
   observation, questionnaires, interviews, and cost capture methods.
   Discussion: This study has the potential to prevent excess weight gain,
   obesity, and health disparities in children by establishing the
   effectiveness of the FCU4Health and collecting information critical for
   healthcare decision makers to support sustainable implementation of
   family-based programs in primary care.},

Title = {Exploring multi-level system factors facilitating educator training and
   implementation of evidence-based practices (EBP): a study protocol},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background: This study examines how system-wide (i.e., region, district,
   and school) mechanisms such as leadership support, training
   requirements, structure, collaboration, and education affect the use of
   evidence-based practices (EBPs) in schools and how this affects the
   outcomes for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite
   growing evidence for the positive effects of EBPs for ASD, these
   practices are not consistently or effectively used in schools. Although
   special education programs are mandated to use EBPs, there are very few
   evidence-based methods for selecting, implementing, and sustaining EBPs.
   Research focuses primarily on teacher training, without attention to
   contextual factors (e.g., implementation climate, attitudes toward EBPs,
   resource allocation, and social networks) that may impact outcomes.
   Using an implementation science framework, this project will
   prospectively examine relations between system-wide factors and
   teachers' use of EBPs and student education outcomes.
   Methods/design: Survey data will be collected from approximately 85
   regional special education directors, 170 regional program specialists,
   265 district special education directors, 265 behavior specialists, 925
   school principals, 3538 special education teachers, and 2700
   paraprofessionals. Administrative data for the students with ASD served
   by participating teachers will be examined. A total of 79 regional-,
   district-, and school-level personnel will also participate in social
   network interviews. Mixed methods, including surveys, administrative
   data, and observational checklists, will be used to gather in-depth
   information about system-wide malleable factors that relate to positive
   teacher implementation of EBPs and student outcomes. Multi-level
   modeling will be used to assess system-wide malleable factors related to
   EBP implementation which will be linked to the trainer, teacher, and
   student outcomes and examined based on moderators (e.g., district size,
   Special Education Local Plan Area structure, teachers' ASD experience).
   Finally, a dynamic social network approach will be used to map
   EBP-related connectivity across all levels of the system for selected
   regions. Dynamic network analysis will be used to gauge the degree to
   which and ways that EBP trainings, resources, and interventions are
   shared (or not shared) among school staff.
   Discussion: Results are expected to inform the development of
   system-wide interventions to improve the school-based implementation of
   EBPs for students with ASD.},

Abstract = {Implementing research findings into healthcare practice and policy is a
   complex process occurring in diverse contexts; it invariably depends on
   changing human behaviour in many parts of an intricate implementation
   system. Questions asked with the aim of improving implementation are
   multifarious variants of `What works, compared with what, how well, with
   what exposure, with what behaviours (for how long), for whom, in what
   setting and why?'. Relevant evidence is being published at a high rate,
   but its quantity, complexity and lack of shared terminologies present
   challenges. The achievement of efficient, effective and timely synthesis
   of evidence is facilitated by using `ontologies' to systematically
   structure and organise the evidence about constructs and their
   relationships, using a controlled, well-defined vocabulary.},

Title = {Implementation and dissemination of a transition of care program for
   rural veterans: a controlled before and after study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {Background: Adapting promising health care interventions to local
   settings is a critical component in the dissemination and implementation
   process. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) rural transitions
   nurse program (TNP) is a nurse-led, Veteran-centered intervention
   designed to improve transitional care for rural Veterans funded by VA
   national offices for dissemination to other VA sites serving a
   predominantly rural Veteran population. Here, we describe our novel
   approach to the implementation and evaluation = the TNP.
   Methods: This is a controlled before and after study that assesses both
   implementation and intervention outcomes. During pre-implementation, we
   assessed site context using a mixed method approach with data from
   diverse sources including facility-level quantitative data, key
   informant and Veteran interviews, observations of the discharge process,
   and a group brainstorming activity. We used the Practical Robust
   Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) to inform our inquiries,
   to integrate data from all sources, and to identify factors that may
   affect implementation. In the implementation phase, we will use internal
   and external facilitation, paired with audit and feedback, to encourage
   appropriate contextual adaptations. We will use a modified Stirman
   framework to document adaptations. During the evaluation phase, we will
   measure intervention and implementation outcomes at each site using the
   RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and
   Maintenance). We will conduct a difference-in-differences analysis with
   propensity-matched Veterans and VA facilities as a control. Our primary
   intervention outcome is 30-day readmission and Emergency Department
   visit rates. We will use our findings to develop an implementation
   toolkit that will inform the larger scale-up of the TNP across the VA.
   Discussion: The use of PRISM to inform pre-implementation evaluation and
   synthesize data from multiple sources, coupled with internal and
   external facilitation, is a novel approach to engaging sites in adapting
   interventions while promoting fidelity to the intervention. Our
   application of PRISM to pre-implementation and midline evaluation, as
   well as documentation of adaptations, provides an opportunity to
   identify and address contextual factors that may impede or enhance
   implementation and sustainability of health interventions and inform
   dissemination.},

Title = {The Human Behaviour-Change Project: harnessing the power of artificial

Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Background: Behaviour change is key to addressing both the challenges
   facing human health and wellbeing and to promoting the uptake of
   research findings in health policy and practice. We need to make better
   use of the vast amount of accumulating evidence from behaviour change
   intervention (BCI) evaluations and promote the uptake of that evidence
   into a wide range of contexts. The scale and complexity of the task of
   synthesising and interpreting this evidence, and increasing evidence
   timeliness and accessibility, will require increased computer support.
   The Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP) will use Artificial
   Intelligence and Machine Learning to (i) develop and evaluate a
   `Knowledge System' that automatically extracts, synthesises and
   interprets findings from BCI evaluation reports to generate new insights
   about behaviour change and improve prediction of intervention
   effectiveness and (ii) allow users, such as practitioners, policy makers
   and researchers, to easily and efficiently query the system to get
   answers to variants of the question `What works, compared with what, how
   well, with what exposure, with what behaviours (for how long), for whom,
   in what settings and why?'.
   Methods: The HBCP will: a) develop an ontology of BCI evaluations and
   their reports linking effect sizes for given target behaviours with
   intervention content and delivery and mechanisms of action, as moderated
   by exposure, populations and settings; b) develop and train an automated
   feature extraction system to annotate BCI evaluation reports using this
   ontology; c) develop and train machine learning and reasoning algorithms
   to use the annotated BCI evaluation reports to predict effect sizes for
   particular combinations of behaviours, interventions, populations and
   settings; d) build user and machine interfaces for interrogating and
   updating the knowledge base; and e) evaluate all the above in terms of
   performance and utility.
   Discussion: The HBCP aims to revolutionise our ability to synthesise,
   interpret and deliver evidence on behaviour change interventions that is
   up-to-date and tailored to user need and context. This will enhance the
   usefulness, and support the implementation of, that evidence.},

Title = {Designing an implementation intervention with the Behaviour Change Wheel
   for health provider smoking cessation care for Australian Indigenous
   pregnant women},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Background: Indigenous smoking rates are up to 80\% among pregnant
   women: prevalence among pregnant Australian Indigenous women was 45\% in
   2014, contributing significantly to the health gap for Indigenous
   Australians. We aimed to develop an implementation intervention to
   improve smoking cessation care (SCC) for pregnant Indigenous smokers, an
   outcome to be achieved by training health providers at Aboriginal
   Medical Services (AMS) in a culturally competent approach, developed
   collaboratively with AMS.
   Method: The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW), incorporating the COM-B model
   (capability, opportunity and motivation for behavioural interventions),
   provided a framework for the development of the Indigenous Counselling
   and Nicotine (ICAN) QUIT in Pregnancy implementation intervention at
   provider and patient levels. We identified evidence-practice gaps
   through (i) systematic literature reviews, (ii) a national survey of
   clinicians and (iii) a qualitative study of smoking and quitting with
   Aboriginal mothers. We followed the three stages recommended in Michie
   et al.'s ``Behaviour Change Wheel{''} guide.
   Results: Targets identified for health provider behaviour change
   included the following: capability (psychological capability, knowledge
   and skills) by training clinicians in pharmacotherapy to assist women to
   quit; motivation (optimism) by presenting evidence of effectiveness, and
   positive testimonials from patients and clinicians; and opportunity
   (environmental context and resources) by promoting a whole-of-service
   approach and structuring consultations using a flipchart and prompts.
   Education and training were selected as the main intervention functions.
   For health providers, the delivery mode was webinar, to accommodate time
   and location constraints, bringing the training to the services; for
   patients, face-to-face consultations were supported by a booklet
   embedded with videos to improve patients' capability, opportunity and
   motivation.
   Conclusions: The ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy was an intervention to train
   health providers at Aboriginal Medical Services in how to implement
   culturally competent evidence-based practice including counselling and
   nicotine replacement therapy for pregnant patients who smoke. The BCW
   aided in scientifically and systematically informing this targeted
   implementation intervention based on the identified gaps in SCC by
   health providers. Multiple factors impact at systemic, provider,
   community and individual levels. This process was therefore important
   for defining the design and intervention components, prior to a
   conducting a pilot feasibility trial, then leading on to a full clinical
   trial.},

Title = {Quality improvement, implementation, and dissemination strategies to
   improve mental health care for children and adolescents: a systematic
   review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: Some outcomes for children with mental health problems
   remain suboptimal because of poor access to care and the failure of
   systems and providers to adopt established quality improvement
   strategies and interventions with proven effectiveness. This review had
   three goals: (1) assess the effectiveness of quality improvement,
   implementation, and dissemination strategies intended to improve the
   mental health care of children and adolescents; (2) examine harms
   associated with these strategies; and (3) determine whether
   effectiveness or harms differ for subgroups based on system,
   organizational, practitioner, or patient characteristics.
   Methods: Sources included MEDLINE (R), the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO,
   and CINAHL, from database inception through February 17, 2017.
   Additional sources included gray literature, additional studies from
   reference lists, and technical experts. Two reviewers selected relevant
   randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, extracted
   data, and assessed risk of bias. Dual analysis, synthesis, and grading
   of the strength of evidence for each outcome followed for studies
   meeting inclusion criteria. We also used qualitative comparative
   analysis to examine relationships between combinations of strategy
   components and improvements in outcomes.
   Results: We identified 18 strategies described in 19 studies. Eleven
   strategies significantly improved at least one measure of intermediate
   outcomes, final health outcomes, or resource use. Moderate strength of
   evidence ( from one RCT) supported using provider financial incentives
   such as pay for performance to improve the competence with which
   practitioners can implement evidence-based practices (EBPs). We found
   inconsistent evidence involving strategies with educational meetings,
   materials, and outreach; programs appeared to be successful in
   combination with reminders or providing practitioners with newly
   collected clinical information. We also found low strength of evidence
   for no benefit for initiatives that included only educational materials
   or meetings (or both), or only educational materials and outreach
   components. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions on harms and
   moderators of interventions.
   Conclusions: Several strategies can improve both intermediate and final
   health outcomes and resource use. This complex and heterogeneous body of
   evidence does not permit us to have a high degree of confidence about
   the efficacy of any one strategy because we generally found only a
   single study testing each strategy.},

Title = {A guide to using the Theoretical Domains Framework of behaviour change
   to investigate implementation problems},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUN 21},
Abstract = {Background: Implementing new practices requires changes in the behaviour
   of relevant actors, and this is facilitated by understanding of the
   determinants of current and desired behaviours. The Theoretical Domains
   Framework (TDF) was developed by a collaboration of behavioural
   scientists and implementation researchers who identified theories
   relevant to implementation and grouped constructs from these theories
   into domains. The collaboration aimed to provide a comprehensive,
   theory-informed approach to identify determinants of behaviour. The
   first version was published in 2005, and a subsequent version following
   a validation exercise was published in 2012. This guide offers practical
   guidance for those who wish to apply the TDF to assess implementation
   problems and support intervention design. It presents a brief rationale
   for using a theoretical approach to investigate and address
   implementation problems, summarises the TDF and its development, and
   describes how to apply the TDF to achieve implementation objectives.
   Examples from the implementation research literature are presented to
   illustrate relevant methods and practical considerations.
   Methods: Researchers from Canada, the UK and Australia attended a 3-day
   meeting in December 2012 to build an international collaboration among
   researchers and decision-makers interested in the advancing use of the
   TDF. The participants were experienced in using the TDF to assess
   implementation problems, design interventions, and/or understand change
   processes. This guide is an output of the meeting and also draws on the
   authors' collective experience. Examples from the implementation
   research literature judged by authors to be representative of specific
   applications of the TDF are included in this guide.
   Results: We explain and illustrate methods, with a focus on qualitative
   approaches, for selecting and specifying target behaviours key to
   implementation, selecting the study design, deciding the sampling
   strategy, developing study materials, collecting and analysing data, and
   reporting findings of TDF-based studies. Areas for development include
   methods for triangulating data, e.g. from interviews, questionnaires and
   observation and methods for designing interventions based on TDF-based
   problem analysis.
   Conclusions: We offer this guide to the implementation community to
   assist in the application of the TDF to achieve implementation
   objectives. Benefits of using the TDF include the provision of a
   theoretical basis for implementation studies, good coverage of potential
   reasons for slow diffusion of evidence into practice and a method for
   progressing from theory-based investigation to intervention.},

Title = {Organizational theory for dissemination and implementation research},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Background: Even under optimal internal organizational conditions,
   implementation can be undermined by changes in organizations' external
   environments, such as fluctuations in funding, adjustments in
   contracting practices, new technology, new legislation, changes in
   clinical practice guidelines and recommendations, or other environmental
   shifts. Internal organizational conditions are increasingly reflected in
   implementation frameworks, but nuanced explanations of how
   organizations' external environments influence implementation success
   are lacking in implementation research. Organizational theories offer
   implementation researchers a host of existing, highly relevant, and
   heretofore largely untapped explanations of the complex interaction
   between organizations and their environment. In this paper, we
   demonstrate the utility of organizational theories for implementation
   research.
   Discussion: We applied four well-known organizational theories
   (institutional theory, transaction cost economics, contingency theories,
   and resource dependency theory) to published descriptions of efforts to
   implement SafeCare, an evidence-based practice for preventing child
   abuse and neglect. Transaction cost economics theory explained how
   frequent, uncertain processes for contracting for SafeCare may have
   generated inefficiencies and thus compromised implementation among
   private child welfare organizations. Institutional theory explained how
   child welfare systems may have been motivated to implement SafeCare
   because doing so aligned with expectations of key stakeholders within
   child welfare systems' professional communities. Contingency theories
   explained how efforts such as interagency collaborative teams promoted
   SafeCare implementation by facilitating adaptation to child welfare
   agencies' internal and external contexts. Resource dependency theory
   (RDT) explained how interagency relationships, supported by contracts,
   memoranda of understanding, and negotiations, facilitated SafeCare
   implementation by balancing autonomy and dependence on funding agencies
   and SafeCare developers.
   Summary: In addition to the retrospective application of organizational
   theories demonstrated above, we advocate for the proactive use of
   organizational theories to design implementation research. For example,
   implementation strategies should be selected to minimize transaction
   costs, promote and maintain congruence between organizations' dynamic
   internal and external contexts over time, and simultaneously attend to
   organizations' financial needs while preserving their autonomy. We
   describe implications of applying organizational theory in
   implementation research for implementation strategies, the evaluation of
   implementation efforts, measurement, research design, theory, and
   practice. We also offer guidance to implementation researchers for
   applying organizational theory.},

Title = {Using media to impact health policy-making: an integrative systematic
   review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {Introduction: Media interventions can potentially play a major role in
   influencing health policies. This integrative systematic review aimed to
   assess the effects of planned media interventions-including social
   media-on the health policy-making process.
   Methods: Eligible study designs included randomized and non-randomized
   designs, economic studies, process evaluation studies, stakeholder
   analyses, qualitative methods, and case studies. We electronically
   searched Medline, EMBASE, Communication and Mass Media Complete,
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the WHO Global
   Health Library. We followed standard systematic review methodology for
   study selection, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment.
   Results: Twenty-one studies met our eligibility criteria: 10 evaluation
   studies using either quantitative (n = 7) or qualitative (n = 3) designs
   and 11 case studies. None of the evaluation studies were on social
   media. The findings of the evaluation studies suggest that media
   interventions may have a positive impact when used as accountability
   tools leading to prioritizing and initiating policy discussions, as
   tools to increase policymakers' awareness, as tools to influence policy
   formulation, as awareness tools leading to policy adoption, and as
   awareness tools to improve compliance with laws and regulations. In one
   study, media-generated attention had a negative effect on policy
   advocacy as it mobilized opponents who defeated the passage of the bills
   that the media intervention advocated for. We judged the confidence in
   the available evidence as limited due to the risk of bias in the
   included studies and the indirectness of the evidence.
   Conclusion: There is currently a lack of reliable evidence to guide
   decisions on the use of media interventions to influence health
   policy-making. Additional and better-designed, conducted, and reported
   primary research is needed to better understand the effects of media
   interventions, particularly social media, on health policy-making
   processes, and the circumstances under which media interventions are
   successful.},

Title = {A Hybrid III stepped wedge cluster randomized trial testing an
   implementation strategy to facilitate the use of an evidence-based
   practice in VA Homeless Primary Care Treatment Programs},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: Homeless veterans often have multiple health care and
   psychosocial needs, including assistance with access to housing and
   health care, as well as support for ongoing treatment engagement. The
   Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) developed specialized Homeless
   Patient Alignment Care Teams (HPACT) with the goal of offering an
   integrated, `` one-stop program{''} to address housing and health care
   needs of homeless veterans. However, while 70\% of HPACT's veteran
   enrollees have co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders,
   HPACT does not have a uniform, embedded treatment protocol for this
   subpopulation. One wraparound intervention designed to address the needs
   of homeless veterans with co-occurring mental health and substance use
   disorders which is suitable to be integrated into HPACT clinic sites is
   the evidence-based practice called Maintaining Independence and Sobriety
   through Systems Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Veterans Edition,
   or MISSION-Vet. Despite the promise of MISSION-Vet within HPACT clinics,
   implementation of an evidence-based intervention within a busy program
   like HPACT can be difficult. The current study is being undertaken to
   identify an appropriate implementation strategy for MISSION-Vet within
   HPACT. The study will test the implementation platform called
   Facilitation and compared to implementation as usual (IU). The aims of
   this study are as follows: (1) Compare the extent to which IU or
   Facilitation strategies achieve fidelity to the MISSION-Vet intervention
   as delivered by HPACT homeless provider staff. (2) Compare the effects
   of Facilitation and IU strategies on the National HPACT Performance
   Measures. (3) Compare the effects of IU and Facilitation on the
   permanent housing status. (4) Identify and describe key stakeholders'
   (patients, providers, staff) experiences with, and perspectives on, the
   barriers to, and facilitators of implementing MISSION.
   Design: Type III Hybrid modified stepped wedge implementation comparing
   IU to Facilitation across seven HPACT teams in three sites in the
   greater Los Angeles VA system. This is a cluster randomized trial.
   Discussion: Integrating MISSION-Vet within HPACT has the potential to
   improve the health of thousands of veterans, but it is crucial to
   implement the intervention appropriately in order for it to succeed. The
   lessons learned in this protocol could assist with a larger roll-out of
   MISSION within HPACT. This protocol is registered with clinicaltrials.

Title = {Using Getting To Outcomes to facilitate the use of an evidence-based
   practice in VA homeless programs: a cluster-randomized trial of an
   implementation support strategy},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: Incorporating evidence-based integrated treatment for dual
   disorders into typical care settings has been challenging, especially
   among those serving Veterans who are homeless. This paper presents an
   evaluation of an effort to incorporate an evidence-based, dual disorder
   treatment called Maintaining Independence and Sobriety Through Systems
   Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Veterans Edition (MISSION-Vet)
   into case management teams serving Veterans who are homeless, using an
   implementation strategy called Getting To Outcomes (GTO).
   Methods: This Hybrid Type III, cluster-randomized controlled trial
   assessed the impact of GTO over and above MISSION-Vet Implementation as
   Usual (IU). Both conditions received standard MISSION-Vet training and
   manuals. The GTO group received an implementation manual, training,
   technical assistance, and data feedback. The study occurred in teams at
   three large VA Medical Centers over 2 years. Within each team, existing
   sub-teams (case managers and Veterans they serve) were the clusters
   randomly assigned. The trial assessed MISSION-Vet services delivered and
   collected via administrative data and implementation barriers and
   facilitators, via semi-structured interview.
   Results: No case managers in the IU group initiated MISSION-Vet while
   68\% in the GTO group did. Seven percent of Veterans with case managers
   in the GTO group received at least one MISSION-Vet session. Most case
   managers appreciated the MISSION-Vet materials and felt the GTO planning
   meetings supported using MISSION-Vet. Case manager interviews also
   showed that MISSION-Vet could be confusing; there was little involvement
   from leadership after their initial agreement to participate; the data
   feedback system had a number of difficulties; and case managers did not
   have the resources to implement all aspects of MISSION-Vet.
   Conclusions: This project shows that GTO-like support can help launch
   new practices but that multiple implementation facilitators are needed
   for successful execution of a complex evidence-based program like
   MISSION-Vet.},

Title = {Methods for designing interventions to change healthcare professionals'
   behaviour: a systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Background: Systematic reviews consistently indicate that interventions
   to change healthcare professional (HCP) behaviour are haphazardly
   designed and poorly specified. Clarity about methods for designing and
   specifying interventions is needed. The objective of this review was to
   identify published methods for designing interventions to change HCP
   behaviour.
   Methods: A search of MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO was conducted from
   1996 to April 2015. Using inclusion/exclusion criteria, a broad screen
   of abstracts by one rater was followed by a strict screen of full text
   for all potentially relevant papers by three raters. An inductive
   approach was first applied to the included studies to identify
   commonalities and differences between the descriptions of methods across
   the papers. Based on this process and knowledge of related literatures,
   we developed a data extraction framework that included, e.g. level of
   change (e.g. individual versus organization); context of development; a
   brief description of the method; tasks included in the method (e.g.
   barrier identification, component selection, use of theory).
   Results: 3966 titles and abstracts and 64 full-text papers were screened
   to yield 15 papers included in the review, each outlining one design
   method. All of the papers reported methods developed within a specific
   context. Thirteen papers included barrier identification and 13 included
   linking barriers to intervention components; although not the same 13
   papers. Thirteen papers targeted individual HCPs with only one paper
   targeting change across individual, organization, and system levels. The
   use of theory and user engagement were included in 13/15 and 13/15
   papers, respectively.
   Conclusions: There is an agreement across methods of four tasks that
   need to be completed when designing individual-level interventions:
   identifying barriers, selecting intervention components, using theory,
   and engaging end-users. Methods also consist of further additional
   tasks. Examples of methods for designing the organisation and
   system-level interventions were limited. Further analysis of design
   tasks could facilitate the development of detailed guidelines for
   designing interventions.},

Title = {Multi-year school-based implementation and student outcomes of an
   evidencebased risk reduction intervention},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Background: Intervention effects observed in efficacy trials are rarely
   replicated when the interventions are broadly disseminated, underscoring
   the need for more information about factors influencing real-life
   implementation and program impact. Using data from the ongoing national
   implementation of an evidence-based HIV prevention program {[}Focus on
   Youth in The Caribbean (FOYC)] in The Bahamas, this study examines
   factors influencing teachers' patterns of implementation, the impact of
   teachers' initial implementation of FOYC, and subsequent delivery of the
   booster sessions on students' outcomes.
   Methods: Data were collected from the 80 government elementary and 34
   middle schools between 2011 and 2014, involving 208 grade 6, 75 grade 7,
   and 58 grade 8 teachers and 4411 students initially in grade 6 and
   followed for 3 years. Student outcomes include HIV/AIDS knowledge,
   reproductive health skills, self-efficacy, and intention to use
   protection. Data from teachers includes implementation and modification
   of the curriculum, attitudes towards the prevention program, comfort
   level with the curriculum, and attendance at training workshops.
   Structural equation modeling and mixed-effect modeling analyses were
   applied to examine the impact of teachers' implementation.
   Results: Teachers' attitudes towards and comfort with the intervention
   curriculum, and attendance at the curriculum training workshop had a
   direct effect on teachers' patterns of implementation, which had a
   direct effect on student outcomes. Teachers' attitudes had a direct
   positive effect on student outcomes. Teachers' training in interactive
   teaching methods and longer duration as teachers were positively
   associated with teachers' comfort with the curriculum. High-quality
   implementation in grade 6 was significantly related to student outcomes
   in grades 6 and 7 post-implementation. Level of implementation of the
   booster sessions in grades 7 and 8 were likewise significantly related
   to subsequent student outcomes in both grades.
   Conclusions: High-quality initial implementation of a prevention program
   is significantly related to better program outcomes. Poor subsequent
   delivery of booster sessions can undermine the positive effects from the
   initial implementation while strong subsequent delivery of booster
   sessions can partially overcome poor initial implementation.},

Title = {Combined use of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
   (CFIR) and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF): a systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Background: Over 60 implementation frameworks exist. Using multiple
   frameworks may help researchers to address multiple study purposes,
   levels, and degrees of theoretical heritage and operationalizability;
   however, using multiple frameworks may result in unnecessary complexity
   and redundancy if doing so does not address study needs. The
   Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the
   Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) are both well-operationalized,
   multi-level implementation determinant frameworks derived from theory.
   As such, the rationale for using the frameworks in combination (i.e.,
   CFIR + TDF) is unclear. The objective of this systematic review was to
   elucidate the rationale for using CFIR + TDF by (1) describing studies
   that have used CFIR + TDF, (2) how they used CFIR + TDF, and (2) their
   stated rationale for using CFIR + TDF.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic review to identify studies that
   mentioned both the CFIR and the TDF, were written in English, were
   peer-reviewed, and reported either a protocol or results of an empirical
   study in MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, or Google Scholar. We
   then abstracted data into a matrix and analyzed it qualitatively,
   identifying salient themes.
   Findings: We identified five protocols and seven completed studies that
   used CFIR + TDF. CFIR + TDF was applied to studies in several countries,
   to a range of healthcare interventions, and at multiple intervention
   phases; used many designs, methods, and units of analysis; and assessed
   a variety of outcomes. Three studies indicated that using CFIR + TDF
   addressed multiple study purposes. Six studies indicated that using CFIR
   + TDF addressed multiple conceptual levels. Four studies did not
   explicitly state their rationale for using CFIR + TDF.
   Conclusions: Differences in the purposes that authors of the CFIR (e.g.,
   comprehensive set of implementation determinants) and the TDF (e.g.,
   intervention development) propose help to justify the use of CFIR + TDF.
   Given that the CFIR and the TDF are both multi-level frameworks, the
   rationale that using CFIR + TDF is needed to address multiple conceptual
   levels may reflect potentially misleading conventional wisdom. On the
   other hand, using CFIR + TDF may more fully define the multi-level
   nature of implementation. To avoid concerns about unnecessary complexity
   and redundancy, scholars who use CFIR + TDF and combinations of other
   frameworks should specify how the frameworks contribute to their study.},

Title = {Evaluation of a large healthy lifestyle program: informing program
   implementation and scale-up in the prevention of obesity},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Background: The Healthy Lifestyle Program for women (HeLP-her) is a
   low-intensity, self-management program which has demonstrated efficacy
   in preventing excess weight gain in women. However, little is known
   about the implementation, reach, and sustainability of low-intensity
   prevention programs in rural settings, where risk for obesity in women
   is higher than urban settings. We aimed to evaluate a low-intensity
   healthy lifestyle program delivered to women in a rural setting to
   inform development of effective community prevention programs.
   Methods: A mixed method hybrid implementation and evaluation study,
   guided by the RE-AIM framework (addressing the Reach, Effectiveness,
   Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance), was undertaken. Data
   collection tools included anthropometric measures, program checklists,
   questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews with participants and
   local stakeholders. The RE-AIM self-audit tool was applied to assess
   evaluation rigor.
   Results: Six hundred and forty-nine women from 41 relatively
   socio-economic disadvantaged communities in Australia participated: mean
   age 39.6 years (+/- SD 6.7) and body mass index of 28.8 kg/m(2) (+/- SD
   6.9). A betweengroup weight difference of -0.92 kg (95\% CI -1.67 to
   -0.16) showed program effectiveness. Reach was broad across 41 towns
   with 62\% of participants reporting influencing some of the health
   behaviors of their families. Strong implementation fidelity was achieved
   with good retention rates at 1 year (76\%) and high participant
   satisfaction (82\% of participants willing to recommend this program).
   Over 300 multi-level community partnerships were established supporting
   high adoption. Stakeholders reported potential capacity to implement and
   sustain the prevention program in resource poor rural settings, due to
   the low-intensity design and minimal resources required.
   Conclusions: Our comprehensive RE-AIM evaluation demonstrates that an
   evidence-based obesity prevention program can be successfully
   implemented in real-world settings. The program achieved broad reach,
   effectiveness, and satisfaction at the community and stakeholder level,
   revealing potential for program sustainability. The evaluation addressed
   implementation knowledge gaps to support future obesity prevention
   program scale-up.},

Title = {Implementing international sexual counselling guidelines in hospital
   cardiac rehabilitation: development of the CHARMS intervention using the
   Behaviour Change Wheel},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Background: Decreased sexual activity and sexual problems are common
   among people with cardiovascular disease, negatively impacting
   relationship satisfaction and quality of life. International guidelines
   recommend routine delivery of sexual counselling to cardiac patients.
   The Cardiac Health and Relationship Management and Sexuality (CHARMS)
   baseline study in Ireland found, similar to international findings,
   limited implementation of sexual counselling guidelines in practice. The
   aim of the current study was to develop the CHARMS multi-level
   intervention to increase delivery of sexual counselling by healthcare
   professionals. We describe the methods used to develop the CHARMS
   intervention following the three phases of the Behaviour Change Wheel
   approach: understand the behaviour, identify intervention options, and
   identify content and implementation options. Survey (n = 60) and focus
   group (n = 14) data from two previous studies exploring why sexual
   counselling is not currently being delivered were coded by two members
   of the research team to understand staff's capability, opportunity, and
   motivation to engage in the behaviour. All potentially relevant
   intervention functions to change behaviour were identified and the
   APEASE (affordability, practicability, effectiveness, acceptability,
   side effects and equity) criteria were used to select the most
   appropriate. The APEASE criteria were then used to choose between all
   behaviour change techniques (BCTs) potentially relevant to the
   identified functions, and these BCTs were translated into intervention
   content. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication
   (TIDieR) checklist was used to specify details of the intervention
   including the who, what, how and where of proposed intervention
   delivery.
   Results: Providing sexual counselling group sessions by cardiac
   rehabilitation staff to patients during phase III cardiac rehabilitation
   was identified as the target behaviour. Education, enablement,
   modelling, persuasion and training were selected as appropriate
   intervention functions. Twelve BCTs, linked to intervention functions,
   were identified for inclusion and translated into CHARMS intervention
   content.
   Conclusions: This paper details the use of Behaviour Change Wheel
   approach to develop an implementation intervention in an
   under-researched area of healthcare provision. The systematic and
   transparent development of the CHARMS intervention will facilitate the
   evaluation of intervention effectiveness and future replication and
   contribute to the advancement of a cumulative science of implementation
   intervention design.},

Title = {Systematic development of a theory-informed multifaceted behavioural
   intervention to increase physical activity of adults with type 2
   diabetes in routine primary care: Movement as Medicine for Type 2
   Diabetes},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {Background: Despite substantial evidence for physical activity (PA) as a
   management option for type 2 diabetes, there remains a lack of PA
   behavioural interventions suitable for delivery in primary care. This
   paper describes the systematic development of an evidence informed PA
   behavioural intervention for use during routine primary care
   consultations.
   Methods: In accordance with the Medical Research Council Framework for
   the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions, a four-stage
   systematic development process was undertaken: (1) exploratory work
   involving interviews and workshop discussions identified training needs
   of healthcare professionals and support needs of adults with type 2
   diabetes; (2) a systematic review with meta- and moderator analyses
   identified behaviour change techniques and optimal intervention
   intensity and duration; (3) usability testing identified strategies to
   increase implementation of the intervention in primary care and (4) an
   open pilot study in two primary care practices facilitated intervention
   optimisation.
   Results: Healthcare professional training needs included knowledge about
   type, intensity and duration of PA sufficient to improve glycaemic
   control and acquisition of skills to promote PA behaviour change.
   Patients lacked knowledge about type 2 diabetes and skills to enable
   them to make sustainable changes to their level of PA. An accredited
   online training programme for healthcare professionals and a
   professional-delivered behavioural intervention for adults with type 2
   diabetes were subsequently developed. This multifaceted intervention was
   informed by the theory of planned behaviour and social cognitive theory
   and consisted of 15 behaviour change techniques. Intervention intensity
   and duration were informed by a systematic review. Usability testing
   resolved technical problems with the online training intervention that
   facilitated use on practice IT systems. An open pilot study of the
   intervention with fidelity of delivery assessment informed optimisation
   and identified mechanisms to enhance implementation of the intervention
   during routine diabetes consultations.
   Conclusions: Movement as Medicine for Type 2 diabetes represents an
   evidence-informed multifaceted behavioural intervention targeting PA for
   management of type 2 diabetes developed for delivery in primacy care.
   The structured development process undertaken enhances transparency of
   intervention content, replicability and scalability. Movement as
   Medicine for Type 2 diabetes is currently undergoing evaluation in a
   pilot RCT.},

Title = {Cluster randomized trial of a multilevel evidence-based quality
   improvement approach to tailoring VA Patient Aligned Care Teams to the
   needs of women Veterans},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {Background: The Veterans Health Administration (VA) has undertaken a
   major initiative to transform care through implementation of Patient
   Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). Based on the patient-centered medical home
   (PCMH) concept, PACT aims to improve access, continuity, coordination,
   and comprehensiveness using team-based care that is patient-driven and
   patient-centered. However, how VA should adapt PACT to meet the needs of
   special populations, such as women Veterans (WVs), was not considered in
   initial implementation guidance. WVs' numerical minority in VA
   healthcare settings (approximately 7-8 \% of users) creates logistical
   challenges to delivering gender-sensitive comprehensive care. The main
   goal of this study is to test an evidence-based quality improvement
   approach (EBQI) to tailoring PACT to meet the needs of WVs,
   incorporating comprehensive primary care services and gender-specific
   care in gender-sensitive environments, thereby accelerating achievement
   of PACT tenets for women (Women's Health (WH)-PACT).
   Methods/design: EBQI is a systematic approach to developing a multilevel
   research-clinical partnership that engages senior organizational leaders
   and local quality improvement (QI) teams in adapting and implementing
   new care models in the context of prior evidence and local practice
   conditions, with researchers providing technical support, formative
   feedback, and practice facilitation. In a 12-site cluster randomized
   trial, we will evaluate WH-PACT model achievement using patient,
   provider, staff, and practice surveys, in addition to analyses of
   secondary administrative and chart-based data. We will explore impacts
   of receipt of WH-PACT care on quality of chronic disease care and
   prevention, health status, patient satisfaction and experience of care,
   provider experience, utilization, and costs. Using mixed methods, we
   will assess pre-post practice contexts; document EBQI activities
   undertaken in participating facilities and their relationship to
   provider/staff and team actions/attitudes; document WH-PACT
   implementation; and examine barriers/facilitators to EBQI-supported
   WH-PACT implementation through a combination of semi-structured
   interviews and monthly formative progress narratives and administrative
   data.
   Discussion: Lack of gender-sensitive comprehensive care has demonstrated
   consequences for the technical quality and ratings of care among WVs and
   may contribute to decisions to continue use or seek care elsewhere under
   the US Affordable Care Act. We hypothesize that tailoring PACT
   implementation through EBQI may improve the experience and quality of
   care at many levels.},

Title = {Impact of primary healthcare providers' initial role security and

   risky alcohol consumption: a cluster randomised factorial trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},

Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Background: Brief interventions in primary healthcare are cost-effective
   in reducing drinking problems but poorly implemented in routine
   practice. Although evidence about implementing brief interventions is
   growing, knowledge is limited with regard to impact of initial role
   security and therapeutic commitment on brief intervention
   implementation.
   Methods: In a cluster randomised factorial trial, 120 primary healthcare
   units (PHCUs) were randomised to eight groups: care as usual, training
   and support, financial reimbursement, and the opportunity to refer
   patients to an internet-based brief intervention (e-BI); paired
   combinations of these three strategies, and all three strategies
   combined. To explore the impact of initial role security and therapeutic
   commitment on implementing brief interventions, we performed multilevel
   linear regression analyses adapted to the factorial design.
   Results: Data from 746 providers from 120 PHCUs were included in the
   analyses. Baseline role security and therapeutic commitment were found
   not to influence implementation of brief interventions. Furthermore,
   there were no significant interactions between these characteristics and
   allocated implementation groups.
   Conclusions: The extent to which providers changed their brief
   intervention delivery following experience of different implementation
   strategies was not determined by their initial attitudes towards alcohol
   problems. In future research, more attention is needed to unravel the
   causal relation between practitioners' attitudes, their actual behaviour
   and care improvement strategies to enhance implementation science.},

Title = {A modified theoretical framework to assess implementation fidelity of
   adaptive public health interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Background: One of the major debates in implementation research turns
   around fidelity and adaptation. Fidelity is the degree to which an
   intervention is implemented as intended by its developers. It is meant
   to ensure that the intervention maintains its intended effects.
   Adaptation is the process of implementers or users bringing changes to
   the original design of an intervention. Depending on the nature of the
   modifications brought, adaptation could either be potentially positive
   or could carry the risk of threatening the theoretical basis of the
   intervention, resulting in a negative effect on expected outcomes.
   Adaptive interventions are those for which adaptation is allowed or even
   encouraged. Classical fidelity dimensions and conceptual frameworks do
   not address the issue of how to adapt an intervention while still
   maintaining its effectiveness.
   Discussion: We support the idea that fidelity and adaptation co-exist
   and that adaptations can impact either positively or negatively on the
   intervention's effectiveness. For adaptive interventions, research
   should answer the question how an adequate fidelity-adaptation balance
   can be reached. One way to address this issue is by looking
   systematically at the aspects of an intervention that are being adapted.
   We conducted fidelity research on the implementation of an empowerment
   strategy for dengue prevention in Cuba. In view of the adaptive nature
   of the strategy, we anticipated that the classical fidelity dimensions
   would be of limited use for assessing adaptations. The typology we used
   in the assessment-implemented, not-implemented, modified, or added
   components of the strategy-also had limitations. It did not allow us to
   answer the question which of the modifications introduced in the
   strategy contributed to or distracted from outcomes. We confronted our
   empirical research with existing literature on fidelity, and as a
   result, considered that the framework for implementation fidelity
   proposed by Carroll et al. in 2007 could potentially meet our concerns.
   We propose modifications to the framework to assess both fidelity and
   adaptation.
   Summary: The modified Carroll et al.'s framework we propose may permit a
   comprehensive assessment of the implementation fidelity-adaptation
   balance required when implementing adaptive interventions, but more
   empirical research is needed to validate it.},

Abstract = {Background: In 2009, Damschroder et al. developed the Consolidated
   Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), which provides a
   comprehensive listing of constructs thought to influence implementation.
   This systematic review assesses the extent to which the CFIR's use in
   implementation research fulfills goals set forth by Damschroder et al.
   in terms of breadth of use, depth of application, and contribution to
   implementation research.
   Methods: We searched Scopus and Web of Science for publications that
   cited the original CFIR publication by Damschroder et al. (Implement Sci
   4:50, 2009) and downloaded each unique result for review. After applying
   exclusion criteria, the final articles were empirical studies published
   in peer-review journals that used the CFIR in a meaningful way (i.e.,
   used the CFIR to guide data collection, measurement, coding, analysis,
   and/or reporting). A framework analysis approach was used to guide
   abstraction and synthesis of the included articles.
   Results: Twenty-six of 429 unique articles (6 \%) met inclusion
   criteria. We found great breadth in CFIR application; the CFIR was
   applied across a wide variety of study objectives, settings, and units
   of analysis. There was also variation in the method of included studies
   (mixed methods (n = 13); qualitative (n = 10); quantitative (n = 3)).
   Depth of CFIR application revealed some areas for improvement. Few
   studies (n = 3) reported justification for selection of CFIR constructs
   used; the majority of studies (n = 14) used the CFIR to guide data
   analysis only; and few studies investigated any outcomes (n = 11).
   Finally, reflections on the contribution of the CFIR to implementation
   research were scarce.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that the CFIR has been used across a
   wide range of studies, though more in-depth use of the CFIR may help
   advance implementation science. To harness its potential, researchers
   should consider how to most meaningfully use the CFIR. Specific
   recommendations for applying the CFIR include explicitly justifying
   selection of CFIR constructs; integrating the CFIR throughout the
   research process (in study design, data collection, and analysis); and
   appropriately using the CFIR given the phase of implementation of the
   research (e.g., if the research is post-implementation, using the CFIR
   to link determinants of implementation to outcomes).},

Title = {Using theory of change to design and evaluate public health
   interventions: a systematic review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the increasing popularity of the theory of change
   (ToC) approach, little is known about the extent to which ToC has been
   used in the design and evaluation of public health interventions. This
   review aims to determine how ToCs have been developed and used in the
   development and evaluation of public health interventions globally.
   Methods: We searched for papers reporting the use of ``theory of
   change{''} in the development or evaluation of public health
   interventions in databases of peer-reviewed journal articles such as
   Scopus, Pubmed, PsychInfo, grey literature databases, Google and
   websites of development funders. We included papers of any date,
   language or study design. Both abstracts and full text papers were
   double screened. Data were extracted and narratively and quantitatively
   summarised.
   Results: A total of 62 papers were included in the review. Forty-nine
   (79 \%) described the development of ToC, 18 (29 \%) described the use
   of ToC in the development of the intervention and 49 (79 \%) described
   the use of ToC in the evaluation of the intervention. Although a large
   number of papers were included in the review, their descriptions of the
   ToC development and use in intervention design and evaluation lacked
   detail.
   Conclusions: The use of the ToC approach is widespread in the public
   health literature. Clear reporting of the ToC process and outputs is
   important to strengthen the body of literature on practical application
   of ToC in order to develop our understanding of the benefits and
   advantages of using ToC. We also propose a checklist for reporting on
   the use of ToC to ensure transparent reporting and recommend that our
   checklist is used and refined by authors reporting the ToC approach.},

Title = {Using intervention mapping to develop a home-based parental-supervised
   toothbrushing intervention for young children},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Background: Dental caries in young children is a major public health
   problem impacting on the child and their family in terms of pain,
   infection and substantial financial burden on healthcare funders. In the
   UK, national guidance on the prevention of dental caries advises parents
   to supervise their child's brushing with fluoride toothpaste until age
   7. However, there is a dearth of evidence-based interventions to
   encourage this practice in parents. The current study used intervention
   mapping (IM) to develop a home-based parental-supervised toothbrushing
   intervention to reduce dental caries in young children.
   Methods: The intervention was developed using the six key stages of the
   IM protocol: (1) needs assessment, including a systematic review,
   qualitative interviews, and meetings with a multi-disciplinary
   intervention development group; (2) identification of outcomes and
   change objectives following identification of the barriers to
   parental-supervised toothbrushing (PSB), mapped alongside psychological
   determinants outlined in the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF); (3)
   selection of methods and practical strategies; (4) production of a
   programme plan; (5) adoption and implementation and (6) Evaluation.
   Results: The comprehensive needs assessment highlighted key barriers to
   PSB, such as knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, routine setting and
   behaviour regulation and underlined the importance of individual, social
   and structural influences. Parenting skills (routine setting and the
   ability to manage the behaviour of a reluctant child) were emphasised as
   critical to the success of PSB. The multi-disciplinary intervention
   development group highlighted the need for both universal and targeted
   programmes, which could be implemented within current provision. Two
   intervention pathways were developed: a lower cost universal pathway
   utilising an existing national programme and an intensive targeted
   programme delivered via existing parenting programmes. A training manual
   was created to accompany each intervention to ensure knowledge and
   standardise implementation procedures.
   Conclusions: PSB is a complex behaviour and requires intervention across
   individual, social and structural levels. IM, although a time-consuming
   process, allowed us to capture this complexity and allowed us to develop
   two community-based intervention pathways covering both universal and
   targeted approaches, which can be integrated into current provision.
   Further research is needed to evaluate the acceptability and
   sustainability of these interventions.},

Title = {The 4KEEPS study: identifying predictors of sustainment of multiple
   practices fiscally mandated in children's mental health services},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Background: Research to date has largely focused on predictors of
   adoption and initial implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs),
   yet sustained implementation is crucial to deliver a return on
   investments in dissemination. Furthermore, most studies focus on single
   EBPs, limiting opportunities to study the fit between practice
   characteristics EBPs and implementation contexts.
   Methods/design: This observational study will characterize
   implementation sustainment and identify organizational and therapist
   characteristics that predict sustainment of multiple practices being
   implemented within a fiscal mandate in the largest public mental health
   system in the USA. Specific aims are to (1) characterize sustainment
   outcomes (volume/penetration, EBP concordant care); (2) use mixed
   methods to characterize inner context (agency-and therapist-level)
   factors and early implementation conditions; and (3) identify inner
   context factors and early implementation conditions that predict
   sustainment outcomes. This study will undertake original data collection
   and analysis of existing data sources to achieve its aims. Archived
   reports and documents will be used to characterize early implementation
   conditions in 102 agencies. Administrative claims data will be used to
   characterize volume and penetration outcomes over 8 years. Therapist and
   program manager surveys will be administered to characterize sustained
   EBP concordant care and inner context determinants of sustainment. An
   in-depth study in a subset of agencies will yield interview data and
   recordings of treatment sessions for validation of the EBP concordant
   care scale.
   Discussion: This project will yield new understanding of whether and how
   multiple EBPs can be sustained in public mental health systems
   undergoing a policy-driven community implementation effort. We will
   produce generalizable models for characterizing sustainment, including
   feasible and flexible measurement of practice across multiple EBPs. The
   findings will inform the development of implementation interventions to
   promote sustained delivery of EBPs to maximize their public health
   impact.},

Title = {Implementing a social network intervention designed to enhance and
   diversify support for people with long-term conditions. A qualitative
   study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 29},
Abstract = {Background: For people with long-term conditions, social networks
   provide a potentially central means of mobilising, mediating and
   accessing support for health and well-being. Few interventions address
   the implementation of improving engagement with and through social
   networks. This paper describes the development and implementation of a
   web-based tool which comprises: network mapping, user-centred preference
   elicitation and need assessment and facilitated engagement with
   resources. The study aimed to determine whether the intervention was
   acceptable, implementable and acted to enhance support and to add to
   theory concerning social networks and engagement with resources and
   activities.
   Methods: A longitudinal design with 15 case studies used ethnographic
   methods comprising video, non-participant observation of intervention
   delivery and qualitative interviews (baseline, 6 and 12 months).
   Participants were people with type 2 diabetes living in a marginalised
   island community. Facilitators were local health trainers and care
   navigators. Analysis applied concepts concerning implementation of
   technology for self-management support to explain how new practices of
   work were operationalised and how the technology impacted on
   relationships fit with everyday life and allowed for visual feedback.
   Results: Most participants reported identifying and taking up new
   activities as a result of using the tool. Thematic analysis suggested
   that workability of the tool was predicated on disruption and
   reconstruction of networks, challenging/supportive facilitation and
   change and reflection over time concerning network support.
   Visualisation of the network enabled people to mobilise support and
   engage in new activities. The tool aligned synergistically with the
   facilitators' role of linking people to local resources.
   Conclusions: The social network tool works through a process of
   initiating positive disruption of established selfmanagement practice
   through mapping and reflection on personal network membership and
   support. This opens up possibilities for reconstructing self-management
   differently from current practice. Key facets of successful
   implementation were: the visual maps of networks and support options;
   facilitation characterised by a perceived lack of status difference
   which assisted engagement and constructive discussion of support and
   preferences for activities; and background work (a reliable database,
   tailored preferences, option reduction) for facilitator and user ease of
   use.},

Title = {Evaluating the QUIT-PRIMO clinical practice ePortal to increase smoker
   engagement with online cessation interventions: a national hybrid type 2
   implementation study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Background: Effective web-assisted tobacco interventions (WATIs) have
   been underutilized by smokers; moreover, despite practice guideline
   recommendations, clinical teams do not routinely refer smokers to WATIs.
   Our goal was to test a clinical practice innovation, an ePortal designed
   to change practice and patient behavior. Our hypotheses were that the
   integrated system would result in increased smoker referrals, with an
   automated follow-up system resulting in more smoker registrations and
   finally augmentations of the WATI would result in more smokers quitting
   at 6 months.
   Methods: Practice ePortal Implementation Trial: Practices (n = 174) were
   randomized to an online practice ePortal with an ``e-referral tool{''}
   to the WATI (e-referred smokers received automated email reminders from
   the practice) and with practice feedback reports with patient tracking
   and practice-to-patient secure messaging versus comparison (a paper
   ``referral prescription{''}). Implementation success was measured by the
   number of smokers referred and smokers registering.
   Clinical Effectiveness Trial: To estimate the effectiveness of the WATI
   components on 6-month smoking cessation, registered smokers were
   randomized into three groups: a state-of-the-art tailored WATI control
   {[}control], the WATI enhanced with proactive, pushed tailored email
   motivational messaging (messaging), and the WATI with messaging further
   enhanced with personal secure messaging with a tobacco treatment
   specialist and an online support group (personalized).
   Results: Practice ePortal Trial results: A total of 4789 smokers were
   referred. The mean smokers referred per practice was not statistically
   different by group (ePortal 24.89 (SD 22.29) versus comparison 30.15 (SD
   25.45), p = 0.15). The e-referral portal implementation program resulted
   in nearly triple the rate of smoker registration (31 \% of all smokers
   referred registered online) versus comparison (11 \%, p < 0.001).
   Clinical Effectiveness Trial results: Active smokers randomized to the
   personalized group had a 6-month cessation rate of 25.2 \%, compared
   with the messaging group (26.7 \%) and the control (17 \%). Next, when
   using an inverse probability weighted selection model to account for
   attrition, those randomized to the two groups that received motivational
   messaging (messaging or personalized) were more likely to quit than
   those in the control (p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: Among all smokers referred, the e-referral resulted in
   nearly threefold greater registrants (31 \%) than paper (11 \%). The
   practice ePortal smokers received multiple reminders (increasing
   registration opportunities), and the practices could track patient
   progress. The result was more smokers registering and, thus, more
   cessation opportunities. Combining the proactive referral and the WATI
   resulted in higher rates of smoking cessation.},

Title = {Using realist review to inform intervention development: methodological
   illustration and conceptual platform for collaborative care in offender
   mental health},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Background: This paper reports how we used a realist review, as part of
   a wider project to improve collaborative mental health care for
   prisoners with common mental health problems, to develop a conceptual
   platform. The importance of offenders gaining support for their mental
   health, and the need for practitioners across the health service, the
   criminal justice system, and the third sector to work together to
   achieve this is recognised internationally. However, the literature does
   not provide coherent analyses of how these ambitions can be achieved.
   This paper demonstrates how a realist review can be applied to inform
   complex intervention development that spans different locations,
   organisations, professions, and care sectors.
   Methods: We applied and developed a realist review for the purposes of
   intervention development, using a three-stage process. (1) An iterative
   database search strategy (extending beyond criminal justice and offender
   health) and groups of academics, practitioners, and people with lived
   experience were used to identify explanatory accounts (n = 347). (2)
   From these accounts, we developed consolidated explanatory accounts (n =
   75). (3) The identified interactions between practitioners and offenders
   (within their organisational, social, and cultural contexts) were
   specified in a conceptual platform. We also specify, step by step, how
   these explanatory accounts were documented, consolidated, and built into
   a conceptual platform. This addresses an important methodological gap
   for social scientists and intervention developers about how to develop
   and articulate programme and implementation theory underpinning complex
   interventions.
   Results: An integrated person-centred system is proposed to improve
   collaborative mental health care for offenders with common mental health
   problems (near to and after release) by achieving consistency between
   the goals of different sectors and practitioners, enabling practitioners
   to apply scientific and experiential knowledge in working judiciously
   and reflectively, and building systems and aligning resources that are
   centred on offenders' health and social care needs.
   Conclusions: As part of a broader programme of work, a realist review
   can make an important contribution to the specification of theoretically
   informed interventions that have the potential to improve health
   outcomes. Our conceptual platform has potential application in related
   systems of health and social care where integrated, and person-centred
   care is a goal.},

Title = {Narrative review of models and success factors for scaling up public
   health interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {Background: To maximise the impact of public health research, research
   interventions found to be effective in improving health need to be
   scaled up and delivered on a population-wide basis. Theoretical
   frameworks and approaches are useful for describing and understanding
   how effective interventions are scaled up from small trials into broader
   policy and practice and can be used as a tool to facilitate effective
   scale-up. The purpose of this literature review was to synthesise
   evidence on scaling up public health interventions into population-wide
   policy and practice, with a focus on the defining and describing
   frameworks, processes and methods of scaling up public health
   initiatives.
   Methods: The review involved keyword searches of electronic databases
   including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EBM Reviews and Google Scholar
   between August and December 2013. Keywords included `scaling up' and
   `scalability', while the search terms `intervention research',
   `translational research', `research dissemination', `health promotion'
   and `public health' were used to focus the search on public health
   approaches. Studies included in the review were published in English
   from January 1990 to December 2013 and described processes, theories or
   frameworks associated with scaling up public health and health promotion
   interventions.
   Results: There is a growing body of literature describing frameworks for
   scaling health interventions, with the review identifying eight
   frameworks, the majority of which have an explicit focus on scaling up
   health action in low and middle income country contexts. Key success
   factors for scaling up included the importance of establishing
   monitoring and evaluation systems, costing and economic modelling of
   intervention approaches, active engagement of a range of implementers
   and the target community, tailoring the scaled-up approach to the local
   context, the use of participatory approaches, the systematic use of
   evidence, infrastructure to support implementation, strong leadership
   and champions, political will, well defined scale-up strategy and strong
   advocacy.
   Conclusions: Effective scaling up requires the systematic use of
   evidence, and it is essential that data from implementation monitoring
   is linked to decision making throughout the scaling up process.
   Conceptual frameworks can assist both policy makers and researchers to
   determine the type of research that is most useful at different stages
   of scaling up processes.},

Title = {What strategies are used to build practitioners' capacity to implement
   community-based interventions and are they effective?: a systematic
   review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {Background: Numerous agencies are providing training, technical
   assistance, and other support to build community-based practitioners'
   capacity to adopt and implement evidence-based prevention interventions.
   Yet, little is known about how best to design capacity-building
   interventions to optimize their effectiveness. Wandersman et al. (Am J
   Community Psychol. 50: 445-59, 2102) proposed the Evidence-Based System
   of Innovation Support (EBSIS) as a framework to guide research and
   thereby strengthen the evidence base for building practitioners'
   capacity. The purpose of this review was to contribute to further
   development of the EBSIS by systematically reviewing empirical studies
   of capacity-building interventions to identify (1) the range of
   strategies used, (2) variations in the way they were structured, and (3)
   evidence for their effectiveness at increasing practitioners' capacity
   to use evidence-based prevention interventions.
   Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched for English-language
   articles reporting findings of empirical studies of capacity-building
   interventions that were published between January 2000 and January 2014
   and were intended to increase use of evidence-based prevention
   interventions in non-clinical settings. To maximize review data, studies
   were not excluded a priori based on design or methodological quality.
   Using the EBSIS as a guide, two researchers independently extracted data
   from included studies. Vote counting and meta-summary methods were used
   to summarize findings.
   Results: The review included 42 publications reporting findings from 29
   studies. In addition to confirming the strategies and structures
   described in the EBSIS, the review identified two new strategies and two
   variations in structure. Capacity-building interventions were found to
   be effective at increasing practitioners' adoption (n = 10 of 12
   studies) and implementation (n = 9 of 10 studies) of evidence-based
   interventions. Findings were mixed for interventions' effects on
   practitioners' capacity or intervention planning behaviors. Both the
   type and structure of capacity-building strategies may have influenced
   effectiveness. The review also identified contextual factors that may
   require variations in the ways capacity-building interventions are
   designed.
   Conclusions: Based on review findings, refinements are suggested to the
   EBSIS. The refined framework moves the field towards a more
   comprehensive and standardized approach to conceptualizing the types and
   structures of capacity-building strategies. This standardization will
   assist with synthesizing findings across studies and guide
   capacity-building practice and research.},

Title = {A cluster randomized Hybrid Type III trial testing an implementation
   support strategy to facilitate the use of an evidence-based practice in
   VA homeless programs},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: The Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs
   Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program is one of the largest initiatives
   to end Veteran homelessness. However, mental health and substance use
   disorders continue to reduce client stability and impede program
   success. HUD-VASH programs do not consistently employ evidence-based
   practices that address co-occurring mental health and substance use
   disorders. This paper presents a study protocol to evaluate the
   implementation of an evidence-based, co-occurring disorder treatment
   called Maintaining Independence and Sobriety Through Systems
   Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Veterans Edition (MISSION-Vet) in
   HUD-VASH using an implementation strategy called Getting To Outcomes
   (GTO).
   Methods/design: In three large VA Medical Centers, this Hybrid Type III
   trial will randomize case managers and their clients by HUD-VASH
   sub-teams to receive either MISSION-Vet Implementation as Usual
   (IU-standard training and access to the MISSION-Vet treatment manuals)
   or MISSION-Vet implementation augmented by GTO. In addition to testing
   GTO, effectiveness of the treatment (MISSION-Vet) will be assessed using
   existing Veteran-level data from the HUD-VASH data monitoring system.
   This project will compare GTO and IU case managers and their clients on
   the following variables: (1) fidelity to the MISSION-Vet intervention;
   (2) proportion of time the Veteran is housed; (3) mental health,
   substance use, and functional outcomes among Veterans; and (4) factors
   key to the successful deployment of a new treatment as specified by the
   Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM)
   model.
   Discussion: This project is an important step for developing an
   implementation strategy to increase adoption of evidence-based practice
   use in VA homeless programs, and to further examine efficacy of
   MISSION-Vet in HUD-VASH. This project has important implications for
   program managers, policy makers, and researchers within the homelessness
   field. VA Central IRB approval for this study was granted in October
   2011. The three sites were trained on MISSION-Vet and GTO in the first
   half of 2013. The first GTO planning meetings began after training
   occurred, between January 2013 and November 2013, across the three
   sites. The data collection-via a fidelity measure embedded into the VA
   Computerized Patient Record System-began as each site initiated
   MISSION-Vet, between April 2013 and January 2014.},

Title = {I-RREACH: an engagement and assessment tool for improving implementation
   readiness of researchers, organizations and communities in complex
   interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Background: Non-communicable chronic diseases are the leading causes of
   mortality globally, and nearly 80\% of these deaths occur in low-and
   middle-income countries (LMICs). In high-income countries (HICs),
   inequitable distribution of resources affects poorer and otherwise
   disadvantaged groups including Aboriginal peoples. Cardiovascular
   mortality in high-income countries has recently begun to fall; however,
   these improvements are not realized among citizens in LMICs or those
   subgroups in high-income countries who are disadvantaged in the social
   determinants of health including Aboriginal people. It is critical to
   develop multi-faceted, affordable and realistic health interventions in
   collaboration with groups who experience health inequalities. Based on
   community-based participatory research (CBPR), we aimed to develop
   implementation tools to guide complex interventions to ensure that
   health gains can be realized in low-resource environments.
   Methods: We developed the I-RREACH (Intervention and Research Readiness
   Engagement and Assessment of Community Health Care) tool to guide
   implementation of interventions in low-resource environments. We
   employed CBPR and a consensus methodology to (1) develop the theoretical
   basis of the tool and (2) to identify key implementation factor domains;
   then, we (3) collected participant evaluation data to validate the tool
   during implementation.
   Results: The I-RREACH tool was successfully developed using a
   community-based consensus method and is rooted in participatory
   principles, equalizing the importance of the knowledge and perspectives
   of researchers and community stakeholders while encouraging respectful
   dialogue. The I-RREACH tool consists of three phases: fact finding,
   stakeholder dialogue and community member/patient dialogue. The
   evaluation for our first implementation of I-RREACH by participants was
   overwhelmingly positive, with 95\% or more of participants indicating
   comfort with and support for the process and the dialogue it creates.
   Conclusions: The I-RREACH tool was designed to (1) pinpoint key domains
   required for dialogue between the community and the research team to
   facilitate implementation of complex health interventions and research
   projects and (2) to identify existing strengths and areas requiring
   further development for effective implementation. I-RREACH has been
   found to be easily adaptable to diverse geographical and cultural
   settings and can be further adapted to other complex interventions.
   Further research should include the potential use of the I-RREACH tool
   in the development of blue prints for scale-up of successful
   interventions, particularly in low-resource environments.},

Title = {Development of a behaviour change intervention to increase upper limb
   exercise in stroke rehabilitation},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {Background: Two thirds of survivors will achieve independent ambulation
   after a stroke, but less than half will recover upper limb function.
   There is strong evidence to support intensive repetitive task-oriented
   training for recovery after stroke. The number of repetitions needed is
   suggested to be in the order of hundreds, but this is not currently
   being achieved in clinical practice. In an effort to bridge this
   evidence-practice gap, we have developed a behaviour change intervention
   that aims to increase provision of upper limb repetitive task-oriented
   training in stroke rehabilitation. This paper aims to describe the
   systematic processes that took place in collaboratively developing the
   behaviour change intervention.
   Methods: The methods used in this study were not defined a priori but
   were guided by the Behaviour Change Wheel. The process was collaborative
   and iterative with four stages of development emerging (i) establishing
   an intervention development group; (ii) structured discussions to
   understand the problem, prioritise target behaviours and analyse target
   behaviours; (iii) collaborative design of theoretically underpinned
   intervention components and (iv) piloting and refining of intervention
   components.
   Results: The intervention development group consisted of the research
   team and stroke therapy team at a local stroke rehabilitation unit. The
   group prioritised four target behaviours at the therapist level: (i)
   identifying suitable patients for exercises, (ii) provision of
   exercises, (iii) communicating exercises to family/visitors and (iv)
   monitoring and reviewing exercises. It also provides a method for
   self-monitoring performance in order to measure fidelity. The developed
   intervention, PRACTISE (Promoting Recovery of the Arm: Clinical Tools
   for Intensive Stroke Exercise), consists of team meetings and the
   PRACTISE Toolkit (screening tool and upper limb exercise plan, PRACTISE
   exercise pack and an audit tool).
   Conclusions: This paper provides an example of how the Behaviour Change
   Wheel may be applied in the collaborative development of a behaviour
   change intervention for health professionals. The process involved was
   resource-intensive, and the iterative process was difficult to capture.
   The use of a published behaviour change framework and taxonomy will
   assist replication in future research and clinical use. The feasibility
   and acceptability of PRACTISE is currently being explored in two other
   stroke rehabilitation units.},

Title = {Effectiveness of a tailored implementation programme to improve

   general practice: a cluster randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Background: Anxiety and depression are not always diagnosed and treated
   in primary care as has been recommended. A tailored implementation
   programme, which addresses key barriers for change by targeted
   interventions, may help to remedy this.
   Methods: The effectiveness of an individually tailored implementation
   programme, additional to standardised training and feedback on the
   recognition and treatment of patients with anxiety or depression in
   general practice, was examined in a cluster randomised controlled trial.
   Participants were 46 general practitioners (GPs) from 23 general
   practices (12 intervention, 11 control) and 444 patients aged 18 years
   or older (198 intervention, 246 control) who screened positive on the
   extended Kessler 10. In the control group, GPs received a 1-day training
   in guidelines for recognition and stepped treatment for anxiety and
   depression. Ten months after the training session, GPs received feedback
   on their performance over the preceding 6 months. In the intervention
   group, GPs received the same training and feedback as those in the
   control condition; in addition, they were offered support, tailored to
   perceived local barriers to change. The support was delivered in the
   format of peer group supervisions and personalised telephone
   consultations. Data were based on an audit of patient records and
   patient surveys at baseline and after 3 and 6 months.
   Results: The tailored implementation programme led to recognition of a
   higher proportion of patients presenting with anxiety and depression
   (42\% versus 31\%; odds ratio (OR) = 1.60; 95\% CI: 1.01-2.53), more
   consultations after recognition (IRR = 1.78; 95\% CI: 1.14-2.78) and did
   not lead to more prescription of antidepressants (OR = 1.07; 95\% CI:
   0.52-2.19) or referral to specialist mental health services (OR = 1.62;
   95\% CI: 0.72-3.64). Patients in the intervention group reported better
   accessibility of care (effect size (ES) = 0.4; p < 0.05) and provision
   of information and advice (ES = 0.5; p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: A tailored implementation programme may enhance the
   recognition and treatment of patients with anxiety or depression.
   Further development and evaluation of the programme is warranted to
   determine its cost-effectiveness.},

Title = {A refined compilation of implementation strategies: results from the
   Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) project},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Background: Identifying, developing, and testing implementation
   strategies are important goals of implementation science. However, these
   efforts have been complicated by the use of inconsistent language and
   inadequate descriptions of implementation strategies in the literature.
   The Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) study aimed to
   refine a published compilation of implementation strategy terms and
   definitions by systematically gathering input from a wide range of
   stakeholders with expertise in implementation science and clinical
   practice.
   Methods: Purposive sampling was used to recruit a panel of experts in
   implementation and clinical practice who engaged in three rounds of a
   modified Delphi process to generate consensus on implementation
   strategies and definitions. The first and second rounds involved
   Web-based surveys soliciting comments on implementation strategy terms
   and definitions. After each round, iterative refinements were made based
   upon participant feedback. The third round involved a live polling and
   consensus process via a Web-based platform and conference call.
   Results: Participants identified substantial concerns with 31\% of the
   terms and/or definitions and suggested five additional strategies.
   Seventy-five percent of definitions from the originally published
   compilation of strategies were retained after voting. Ultimately, the
   expert panel reached consensus on a final compilation of 73
   implementation strategies.
   Conclusions: This research advances the field by improving the
   conceptual clarity, relevance, and comprehensiveness of implementation
   strategies that can be used in isolation or combination in
   implementation research and practice. Future phases of ERIC will focus
   on developing conceptually distinct categories of strategies as well as
   ratings for each strategy's importance and feasibility. Next, the expert
   panel will recommend multifaceted strategies for hypothetical yet
   real-world scenarios that vary by sites' endorsement of evidence-based
   programs and practices and the strength of contextual supports that
   surround the effort.},

Title = {Enhancing outreach for persons with serious mental illness: 12-month
   results from a cluster randomized trial of an adaptive implementation
   strategy},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Background: Few implementation strategies have been empirically tested
   for their effectiveness in improving uptake of evidence-based treatments
   or programs. This study compared the effectiveness of an immediate
   versus delayed enhanced implementation strategy (Enhanced Replicating
   Effective Programs (REP)) for providers at Veterans Health
   Administration (VA) outpatient facilities (sites) on improved uptake of
   an outreach program (Re-Engage) among sites not initially responding to
   a standard implementation strategy.
   Methods: One mental health provider from each U.S. VA site (N = 158) was
   initially given a REP-based package and training program in Re-Engage.
   The Re-Engage program involved giving each site provider a list of
   patients with serious mental illness who had not been seen at their
   facility for at least a year, requesting that providers contact these
   patients, assessing patient clinical status, and where appropriate,
   facilitating appointments to VA health services. At month 6, sites
   considered non-responsive (N = 89, total of 3,075 patients), defined as
   providers updating documentation for less than <80\% of patients on
   their list, were randomized to two adaptive implementation
   interventions: Enhanced REP (provider coaching; N = 40 sites) for 6
   months followed by Standard REP for 6 months; versus continued Standard
   REP (N = 49 sites) for 6 months followed by 6 months of Enhanced REP for
   sites still not responding. Outcomes included patient-level Re-Engage
   implementation and utilization.
   Results: Patients from sites that were randomized to receive Enhanced
   REP immediately compared to Standard REP were more likely to have a
   completed contact (adjusted OR = 2.13; 95\% CI: 1.09-4.19, P = 0.02).
   There were no differences in patient-level utilization between Enhanced
   and Standard REP sites.
   Conclusions: Enhanced REP was associated with greater Re-Engage program
   uptake (completed contacts) among sites not responding to a standard
   implementation strategy. Further research is needed to determine whether
   national implementation of Facilitation results in tangible changes in
   patient-level outcomes.},

Title = {Using realist evaluation to open the black box of knowledge translation:
   a state-of-the-art review},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Background: In knowledge translation, complex interventions may be
   implemented in the attempt to improve uptake of research-based knowledge
   in practice. Traditional evaluation efforts that focus on aggregate
   effectiveness represent an oversimplification of both the environment
   and the interventions themselves. However, theory-based approaches to
   evaluation, such as realist evaluation (RE), may be better-suited to
   examination of complex knowledge translation interventions with a view
   to understanding what works, for whom, and under what conditions. It is
   the aim of the present state-of-the-art review to examine current
   literature with regard to the use of RE in the assessment of knowledge
   translation interventions implemented within healthcare environments.
   Methods: Multiple online databases were searched from 1997 through June
   2013. Primary studies examining the application or implementation of
   knowledge translation interventions within healthcare settings and using
   RE were selected for inclusion. Varying applications of RE across
   studies were examined in terms of a) reporting of core elements of RE,
   and b) potential feasibility of this evaluation method.
   Results: A total of 14 studies (6 study protocols), published between
   2007 and 2013, were identified for inclusion. Projects were initiated in
   a variety of healthcare settings and represented a range of
   interventions. While a majority of authors mentioned context (C),
   mechanism (M) and outcome (O), a minority reported the development of
   C-M-O configurations or testable hypotheses based on these
   configurations. Four completed studies reported results that included
   refinement of proposed C-M-O configurations and offered explanations
   within the RE framework. In the few studies offering insight regarding
   challenges associated with the use of RE, difficulties were expressed
   regarding the definition of both mechanisms and contextual factors.
   Overall, RE was perceived as time-consuming and resource intensive.
   Conclusions: The use of RE in knowledge translation is relatively new;
   however, theory-building approaches to the examination of complex
   interventions in this area may be increasing as researchers attempt to
   identify what works, for whom and under what circumstances. Completion
   of the RE cycle may be challenging, particularly in the development of
   C-M-O configurations; however, as researchers approach challenges and
   explore innovations in its application, rich and detailed accounts may
   improve feasibility.},

Title = {Implementing an outreaching, preference-led stepped care intervention
   programme to reduce late life depressive symptoms: results of a
   mixed-methods study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Background: Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in old age, but
   they remain mostly untreated. Several clinical trials have shown
   promising results in preventing or reducing depressive symptoms.
   However, it is not clear how robust these effects are in the real world
   of day-to-day care. Therefore, we have implemented the `Lust for Life'
   programme, which significantly reduced depressive symptoms in
   community-dwelling older adults in the first three months after
   implementation. This mixed-methods study was conducted alongside the
   trial to develop a contextualised understanding of factors affecting the
   implementation.
   Methods: A total of 263 persons of 65 years and older with depressive
   symptoms were recruited from 18 general practices and home care
   organizations in the Netherlands. We used qualitative data (in-depth
   interviews and focus group discussions with participants with depressive
   symptoms and healthcare professionals) as well as quantitative data
   (longitudinal data on the severity of depressive symptoms) to explore
   hindering and facilitating factors to the implementation of the `Lust
   for Life' programme.
   Results: The uptake of the routine screening was poor and imposed
   significant burdens on participants and healthcare professionals, and
   drop-out rates were high. Participants' perceived mental problems and
   need for care played a key role in their decision to participate in the
   programme and to step up to consequent interventions. Older people
   preferred interventions that focused on interpersonal contact. The
   programme was only effective when delivered by mental healthcare nurses,
   compared to home care nurses with limited experience in providing mental
   healthcare.
   Conclusions: The intervention programme was effective in reducing
   depressive symptoms, and valuable lessons can be learned from this
   implementation trial. Given the low uptake and high investment, we
   advise against routine screening for depressive symptoms in general
   healthcare. Further, agreement between the participant and healthcare
   professional on perceived need for care and intervention is vital.
   Rather than providing a stepped care intervention programme, we showed
   that offering only one single preference-led intervention is effective.
   Lastly, since the provision of the interventions seems to ask for
   specific skills and experiences, it might require mental healthcare
   nurses to offer the programme.},

Title = {GRAIDs: a framework for closing the gap in the availability of health
   promotion programs and interventions for people with disabilities},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {Background: Evidence-based health promotion programs developed and
   tested in the general population typically exclude people with
   disabilities. To address this gap, a set of methods and criteria were
   created to adapt evidence-based health promotion programs for people
   with disabilities. In this first study, we describe a framework for
   adapting evidence-based obesity prevention strategies for people with
   disabilities. We illustrate how the framework has been used to adapt the
   U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) obesity
   prevention strategies for individuals with physical and developmental
   disabilities.
   Methods: The development of inclusion guidelines, recommendations and
   adaptations for obesity prevention (referred to as GRAIDs - Guidelines,
   Recommendations, Adaptations Including Disability) consists of five
   components: (i) a scoping review of the published and grey literature;
   (ii) an expert workgroup composed of nationally recognized leaders in
   disability and health promotion who review, discuss and modify the
   scoping review materials and develop the content into draft GRAIDs;
   (iii) focus groups with individuals with disabilities and their family
   members (conducted separately) who provide input on the potential
   applicability of the proposed GRAIDs in real world settings; (iv) a
   national consensus meeting with 21 expert panel members who review and
   vote on a final set of GRAIDs; and (v) an independent peer review of
   GRAIDs by national leaders from key disability organizations and
   professional groups through an online web portal.
   Results: This is an ongoing project, and to date, the process has been
   used to develop 11 GRAIDs to coincide with 11 of the 24 CDC obesity
   prevention strategies.
   Conclusion: A set of methods and criteria have been developed to allow
   researchers, practitioners and government agencies to promote inclusive
   health promotion guidelines, strategies and practices for people with
   disabilities. Evidence-based programs developed for people without
   disabilities can now be adapted for people with disabilities using the
   GRAIDs framework.},

Title = {Barriers and enablers to delivery of the Healthy Kids Check: an analysis
   informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework and COM-B model},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {Background: More than a fifth of Australian children arrive at school
   developmentally vulnerable. To counteract this, the Healthy Kids Check
   (HKC), a one-off health assessment aimed at preschool children, was
   introduced in 2008 into Australian general practice. Delivery of
   services has, however, remained low. The Theoretical Domains Framework,
   which provides a method to understand behaviours theoretically, can be
   condensed into three core components: capability, opportunity and
   motivation, and the COM-B model. Utilising this system, this study aimed
   to determine the barriers and enablers to delivery of the HKC, to inform
   the design of an intervention to promote provision of HKC services in
   Australian general practice.
   Methods: Data from 6 focus group discussions with 40 practitioners from
   general practices in socio-culturally diverse areas of Melbourne,
   Victoria, were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Many practitioners expressed uncertainty regarding their
   capabilities and the practicalities of delivering HKCs, but in some
   cases HKCs had acted as a catalyst for professional development. Key
   connections between immunisation services and delivery of HKCs prompted
   practices to have systems of recall and reminder in place.
   Standardisation of methods for developmental assessment and streamlined
   referral pathways affected practitioners' confidence and motivation to
   perform HKCs.
   Conclusion: Application of a systematic framework effectively
   demonstrated how a number of behaviours could be targeted to increase
   delivery of HKCs. Interventions need to target practice systems, the
   support of office staff and referral options, as well as practitioners'
   training. Many behavioural changes could be applied through a single
   intervention programme delivered by the primary healthcare organisations
   charged with local healthcare needs (Medicare Locals) providing vital
   links between general practice, community and the health of young
   children.},

Title = {Development of a behaviour change intervention: a case study on the
   practical application of theory},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Background: Use of theory in implementation of complex interventions is
   widely recommended. A complex trial intervention, to enhance
   self-management support for people with osteoarthritis (OA) in primary
   care, needed to be implemented in the Managing Osteoarthritis in
   Consultations (MOSAICS) trial. One component of the trial intervention
   was delivery by general practitioners (GPs) of an enhanced consultation
   for patients with OA. The aim of our case study is to describe the
   systematic selection and use of theory to develop a behaviour change
   intervention to implement GP delivery of the enhanced consultation.
   Methods: The development of the behaviour change intervention was guided
   by four theoretical models/frameworks: i) an implementation of change
   model to guide overall approach, ii) the Theoretical Domains Framework
   (TDF) to identify relevant determinants of change, iii) a model for the
   selection of behaviour change techniques to address identified
   determinants of behaviour change, and iv) the principles of adult
   learning. Methods and measures to evaluate impact of the behaviour
   change intervention were identified.
   Results: The behaviour change intervention presented the GPs with a
   well-defined proposal for change; addressed seven of the TDF domains (e.
   g., knowledge, skills, motivation and goals); incorporated ten behaviour
   change techniques (e. g., information provision, skills rehearsal,
   persuasive communication); and was delivered in workshops that valued
   the expertise and professional values of GPs. The workshops used a
   mixture of interactive and didactic sessions, were facilitated by
   opinion leaders, and utilised `context-bound communication skills
   training.' Methods and measures selected to evaluate the behaviour
   change intervention included: appraisal of satisfaction with workshops,
   GP report of intention to practise and an assessment of video-recorded
   consultations of GPs with patients with OA.
   Conclusions: A stepped approach to the development of a behaviour change
   intervention, with the utilisation of theoretical frameworks to identify
   determinants of change matched with behaviour change techniques, has
   enabled a systematic and theory-driven development of an intervention
   designed to enhance consultations by GPs for patients with OA. The
   success of the behaviour change intervention in practice will be
   evaluated in the context of the MOSAICS trial as a whole, and will
   inform understanding of practice level and patient outcomes in the
   trial.},

Title = {A cluster randomized trial to evaluate external support for the
   implementation of positive behavioral interventions and supports by
   school personnel},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Background: Urban schools lag behind non-urban schools in attending to
   the behavioral health needs of their students. This is especially
   evident with regard to the level of use of evidence-based interventions
   with school children. Increased used of evidence-based interventions in
   urban schools would contribute to reducing mental health services
   disparities in low-income communities. School-wide positive behavioral
   interventions and supports (SWPBIS) is a service delivery framework that
   can be used to deliver universal preventive interventions and
   evidence-based behavioral health treatments, such as group cognitive
   behavioral therapy. In this article, we describe our ongoing research on
   creating internal capacity for program implementation. We also examine
   the cost-effectiveness and resulting school climate when two different
   levels of external support are provided to personnel as they implement a
   two-tier SWPBIS program.
   Methods/ Design: The study follows six K - 8 schools in the School
   District of Philadelphia randomly assigned to consultation support or
   consultation-plus-coaching support. Participants are: approximately 48
   leadership team members, 180 school staff and 3,900 students in Tier 1,
   and 12 counselors, and 306 child participants in Tier 2. Children who
   meet inclusion criteria for Tier 2 will participate in group cognitive
   behavioral therapy for externalizing or anxiety disorders. The study has
   three phases, baseline/training, implementation, and sustainability. We
   will measure implementation outcomes, service outcomes, child outcomes,
   and cost.
   Discussion: Findings from this study will provide evidence as to the
   appropriateness of school-wide prevention and treatment service delivery
   models for addressing services disparities in schools. The effectiveness
   and cost-effectiveness analyses of the two levels of training and
   consultation should help urban school districts and policymakers with
   the planning and deployment of cost-effective strategies for the
   implementation of evidence-based interventions for some of the most
   common behavioral health problems in school children.},

Title = {A qualitative systematic review of studies using the normalization
   process theory to research implementation processes},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Background: There is a well-recognized need for greater use of theory to
   address research translational gaps. Normalization Process Theory (NPT)
   provides a set of sociological tools to understand and explain the
   social processes through which new or modified practices of thinking,
   enacting, and organizing work are implemented, embedded, and integrated
   in healthcare and other organizational settings. This review of NPT
   offers readers the opportunity to observe how, and in what areas, a
   particular theoretical approach to implementation is being used. In this
   article we review the literature on NPT in order to understand what
   interventions NPT is being used to analyze, how NPT is being
   operationalized, and the reported benefits, if any, of using NPT.
   Methods: Using a framework analysis approach, we conducted a qualitative
   systematic review of peer-reviewed literature using NPT. We searched 12
   electronic databases and all citations linked to six key NPT development
   papers. Grey literature/unpublished studies were not sought. Limitations
   of English language, healthcare setting and year of publication 2006 to
   June 2012 were set.
   Results: Twenty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria; in the main,
   NPT is being applied to qualitatively analyze a diverse range of complex
   interventions, many beyond its original field of e-health and
   telehealth. The NPT constructs have high stability across settings and,
   notwithstanding challenges in applying NPT in terms of managing overlaps
   between constructs, there is evidence that it is a beneficial heuristic
   device to explain and guide implementation processes.
   Conclusions: NPT offers a generalizable framework that can be applied
   across contexts with opportunities for incremental knowledge gain over
   time and an explicit framework for analysis, which can explain and
   potentially shape implementation processes. This is the first review of
   NPT in use and it generates an impetus for further and extended use of
   NPT. We recommend that in future NPT research, authors should explicate
   their rationale for choosing NPT as their theoretical framework and,
   where possible, involve multiple stakeholders including service users to
   enable analysis of implementation from a range of perspectives.},

Title = {Cluster randomized adaptive implementation trial comparing a standard
   versus enhanced implementation intervention to improve uptake of an
   effective re-engagement program for patients with serious mental illness},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Background: Persons with serious mental illness (SMI) are
   disproportionately burdened by premature mortality. This disparity is
   exacerbated by poor continuity of care with the health system. The
   Veterans Health Administration (VA) developed Re-Engage, an effective
   population-based outreach program to identify veterans with SMI lost to
   care and to reconnect them with VA services. However, such programs
   often encounter barriers getting implemented into routine care. Adaptive
   designs are needed when the implementation intervention requires
   augmentation within sites that do not initially respond to an initial
   implementation intervention. This protocol describes the methods used in
   an adaptive implementation design study that aims to compare the
   effectiveness of a standard implementation strategy (Replicating
   Effective Programs, or REP) with REP enhanced with External Facilitation
   (enhanced REP) to promote the uptake of Re-Engage.
   Methods/Design: This study employs a four-phase, two-arm, longitudinal,
   clustered randomized trial design. VA sites (n = 158) across the United
   States with a designated Re-Engage provider, at least one Veteran with
   SMI lost to care, and who received standard REP during a six-month
   run-in phase. Subsequently, 88 sites with inadequate uptake were
   stratified at the cluster level by geographic region (n = 4) and VA
   regional service network (n = 20) and randomized to REP (n = 49) vs.
   enhanced REP (n = 39) in phase two. The primary outcome was the
   percentage of veterans on each facility outreach list documented on an
   electronic web registry. The intervention was at the site and network
   level and consisted of standard REP versus REP enhanced by external
   phone facilitation consults. At 12 months, enhanced REP sites returned
   to standard REP and 36 sites with inadequate participation received
   enhanced REP for six months in phase three. Secondary implementation
   outcomes included the percentage of veterans contacted directly by site
   providers and the percentage re-engaged in VA health services.
   Discussion: Adaptive implementation designs consisting of a sequence of
   decision rules that are tailored based on a site's uptake of an
   effective program may produce more relevant, rapid, and generalizable
   results by more quickly validating or rejecting new implementation
   strategies, thus enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of
   implementation research and potentially leading to the rollout of more
   cost-efficient implementation strategies.},

Title = {Immediate versus sustained effects: interrupted time series analysis of
   a tailored intervention},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Background: Detailed intervention descriptions and robust evaluations
   that test intervention impact-and explore reasons for impact-are an
   essential part of progressing implementation science. Time series
   designs enable the impact and sustainability of intervention effects to
   be tested. When combined with time series designs, qualitative methods
   can provide insight into intervention effectiveness and help identify
   areas for improvement for future interventions. This paper describes the
   development, delivery, and evaluation of a tailored intervention
   designed to increase primary health care professionals' adoption of a
   national recommendation that women with mild to moderate postnatal
   depression (PND) are referred for psychological therapy as a first stage
   treatment.
   Methods: Three factors influencing referral for psychological treatment
   were targeted using three related intervention components: a tailored
   educational meeting, a tailored educational leaflet, and changes to an
   electronic system data template used by health professionals during
   consultations for PND. Evaluation comprised time series analysis of
   monthly audit data on percentage referral rates and monthly first
   prescription rates for antidepressants. Interviews were conducted with a
   sample of health professionals to explore their perceptions of the
   intervention components and to identify possible factors influencing
   intervention effectiveness.
   Results: The intervention was associated with a significant, immediate,
   positive effect upon percentage referral rates for psychological
   treatments. This effect was not sustained over the ten month follow-on
   period. Monthly rates of anti-depressant prescriptions remained
   consistently high after the intervention. Qualitative interview findings
   suggest key messages received from the intervention concerned what
   appropriate antidepressant prescribing is, suggesting this to underlie
   the lack of impact upon prescribing rates. However, an understanding
   that psychological treatment can have long-term benefits was also cited.
   Barriers to referral identified before intervention were cited again
   after the intervention, suggesting the intervention had not successfully
   tackled the barriers targeted.
   Conclusion: A time series design allowed the initial and sustained
   impact of our intervention to be tested. Combined with qualitative
   interviews, this provided insight into intervention effectiveness.
   Future research should test factors influencing intervention
   sustainability, and promote adoption of the targeted behavior and dis
   adoption of competing behaviors where appropriate.},

Title = {Knowledge translation strategies to improve the use of evidence in
   public health decision making in local government: intervention design
   and implementation plan},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {Background: Knowledge translation strategies are an approach to increase
   the use of evidence within policy and practice decision-making contexts.
   In clinical and health service contexts, knowledge translation
   strategies have focused on individual behavior change, however the
   multi-system context of public health requires a multi-level,
   multi-strategy approach. This paper describes the design of and
   implementation plan for a knowledge translation intervention for public
   health decision making in local government.
   Methods: Four preliminary research studies contributed findings to the
   design of the intervention: a systematic review of knowledge translation
   intervention effectiveness research, a scoping study of knowledge
   translation perspectives and relevant theory literature, a survey of the
   local government public health workforce, and a study of the use of
   evidence-informed decision-making for public health in local government.
   A logic model was then developed to represent the putative pathways
   between intervention inputs, processes, and outcomes operating between
   individual-, organizational-, and system-level strategies. This formed
   the basis of the intervention plan.
   Results: The systematic and scoping reviews identified that effective
   and promising strategies to increase access to research evidence require
   an integrated intervention of skill development, access to a knowledge
   broker, resources and tools for evidence-informed decision making, and
   networking for information sharing. Interviews and survey analysis
   suggested that the intervention needs to operate at individual and
   organizational levels, comprising workforce development, access to
   evidence, and regular contact with a knowledge broker to increase access
   to intervention evidence; develop skills in appraisal and integration of
   evidence; strengthen networks; and explore organizational factors to
   build organizational cultures receptive to embedding evidence in
   practice. The logic model incorporated these inputs and strategies with
   a set of outcomes to measure the intervention's effectiveness based on
   the theoretical frameworks, evaluation studies, and decision-maker
   experiences.
   Conclusion: Documenting the design of and implementation plan for this
   knowledge translation intervention provides a transparent, theoretical,
   and practical approach to a complex intervention. It provides
   significant insights into how practitioners might engage with evidence
   in public health decision making. While this intervention model was
   designed for the local government context, it is likely to be applicable
   and generalizable across sectors and settings.},

Title = {The dynamic sustainability framework: addressing the paradox of
   sustainment amid ongoing change},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Background: Despite growth in implementation research, limited
   scientific attention has focused on understanding and improving
   sustainability of health interventions. Models of sustainability have
   been evolving to reflect challenges in the fit between intervention and
   context.
   Discussion: We examine the development of concepts of sustainability,
   and respond to two frequent assumptions - `voltage drop,' whereby
   interventions are expected to yield lower benefits as they move from
   efficacy to effectiveness to implementation and sustainability, and
   `program drift,' whereby deviation from manualized protocols is assumed
   to decrease benefit. We posit that these assumptions limit opportunities
   to improve care, and instead argue for understanding the changing
   context of healthcare to continuously refine and improve interventions
   as they are sustained. Sustainability has evolved from being considered
   as the endgame of a translational research process to a suggested
   `adaptation phase' that integrates and institutionalizes interventions
   within local organizational and cultural contexts. These recent
   approaches locate sustainability in the implementation phase of
   knowledge transfer, but still do not address intervention improvement as
   a central theme. We propose a Dynamic Sustainability Framework that
   involves: continued learning and problem solving, ongoing adaptation of
   interventions with a primary focus on fit between interventions and
   multi-level contexts, and expectations for ongoing improvement as
   opposed to diminishing outcomes over time.
   Summary: A Dynamic Sustainability Framework provides a foundation for
   research, policy and practice that supports development and testing of
   falsifiable hypotheses and continued learning to advance the
   implementation, transportability and impact of health services research.},

Title = {Protocol for CONSORT-SPI: an extension for social and psychological
   interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Background: Determining the effectiveness of social and psychological
   interventions is important for improving individual and population
   health. Such interventions are complex and, where possible, are best
   evaluated by randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The use of research
   findings in policy and practice decision making is hindered by poor
   reporting of RCTs. Poor reporting limits the ability to replicate
   interventions, synthesise evidence in systematic reviews, and utilise
   findings for evidence-based policy and practice. The lack of guidance
   for reporting the specific methodological features of complex
   intervention RCTs contributes to poor reporting. We aim to develop an
   extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement
   for Social and Psychological Interventions (CONSORT-SPI).
   Methods/design: This research project will be conducted in five phases.
   The first phase was the project launch, which consisted of the
   establishment of a Project Executive and International Advisory Group,
   and recruitment of journal editors and the CONSORT Group. The second
   phase involves a Delphi process that will generate a list of possible
   items to include in the CONSORT Extension. Next, there will be a formal
   consensus meeting to select the reporting items to add to, or modify
   for, the CONSORT-SPI Extension. Fourth, guideline documents will be
   written, including an explanation and elaboration (E\&E) document that
   will provide detailed advice for each item and examples of good
   reporting. The final phase will comprise guideline dissemination, with
   simultaneous publication and endorsement of the guideline in multiple
   journals, endorsement by funding agencies, presentations at conferences
   and other meetings, and a dedicated website that will facilitate
   feedback about the guideline.
   Conclusion: As demonstrated by previous CONSORT guidelines, the
   development of an evidence-based reporting guideline for social and
   psychological intervention RCTs should improve the accuracy,
   comprehensiveness, and transparency of study reports. This, in turn,
   promises to improve the critical appraisal of research and its use in
   policy and practice decision making. We invite readers to participate in
   the project by visiting our website (http://tinyurl.com/CONSORT-study).},

Title = {A study protocol for applying the co-creating knowledge translation
   framework to a population health study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {Background: Population health research can generate significant outcomes
   for communities, while Knowledge Translation (KT) aims to expressly
   maximize the outcomes of knowledge producing activity. Yet the two
   approaches are seldom explicitly combined as part of the research
   process. A population health study in Port Lincoln, South Australia
   offered the opportunity to develop and apply the co-KT Framework to the
   entire research process. This is a new framework to facilitate knowledge
   formation collaboratively between researchers and communities throughout
   a research to intervention implementation process.
   Design: This study employs a five step framework (the co-KT Framework)
   that is formulated from engaged scholarship and action research
   principles. By following the steps a knowledge base will be cumulatively
   co-created with the study population that is useful to the research
   aims. Step 1 is the initiating of contact between the researcher and the
   study contexts, and the framing of the research issue, achieved through
   a systematic data collection tool. Step 2 refines the research issue and
   the knowledge base by building into it context specific details and
   conducting knowledge exchange events. Step 3 involves interpreting and
   analysing the knowledge base, and integrating evidence to inform
   intervention development. In Step 4 the intervention will be piloted and
   evaluated. Step 5 is the completion of the research process where
   outcomes for improvement will be instituted as regular practice with the
   facilitation of the community.
   In summary, the model uses an iterative knowledge construction mechanism
   that is complemented by external evidence to design interventions to
   address health priorities within the community.
   Discussion: This is a systematic approach that operationalises the
   translational cycle using a framework for KT practice. It begins with
   the local context as its foundation for knowledge creation and ends with
   the development of contextually applicable interventions. It will be of
   interest to those involved in KT research, participatory action
   research, population health research and health care systems studies.
   The co-KT Framework is a method for embedding the principles of KT into
   all stages of a community-based research process, in which research
   questions are framed by emergent data from each previous stage.},

Title = {Development of a framework and coding system for modifications and
   adaptations of evidence-based interventions},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Background: Evidence-based interventions are frequently modified or
   adapted during the implementation process. Changes may be made to
   protocols to meet the needs of the target population or address
   differences between the context in which the intervention was originally
   designed and the one into which it is implemented {[}Addict Behav 2011,
   36(6):630-635]. However, whether modification compromises or enhances
   the desired benefits of the intervention is not well understood. A
   challenge to understanding the impact of specific types of modifications
   is a lack of attention to characterizing the different types of changes
   that may occur. A system for classifying the types of modifications that
   are made when interventions and programs are implemented can facilitate
   efforts to understand the nature of modifications that are made in
   particular contexts as well as the impact of these modifications on
   outcomes of interest.
   Methods: We developed a system for classifying modifications made to
   interventions and programs across a variety of fields and settings. We
   then coded 258 modifications identified in 32 published articles that
   described interventions implemented in routine care or community
   settings.
   Results: We identified modifications made to the content of
   interventions, as well as to the context in which interventions are
   delivered. We identified 12 different types of content modifications,
   and our coding scheme also included ratings for the level at which these
   modifications were made (ranging from the individual patient level up to
   a hospital network or community). We identified five types of contextual
   modifications (changes to the format, setting, or patient population
   that do not in and of themselves alter the actual content of the
   intervention). We also developed codes to indicate who made the
   modifications and identified a smaller subset of modifications made to
   the ways that training or evaluations occur when evidence-based
   interventions are implemented. Rater agreement analyses indicated that
   the coding scheme can be used to reliably classify modifications
   described in research articles without overly burdensome training.
   Conclusions: This coding system can complement research on fidelity and
   may advance research with the goal of understanding the impact of
   modifications made when evidence-based interventions are implemented.
   Such findings can further inform efforts to implement such interventions
   while preserving desired levels of program or intervention
   effectiveness.},

Title = {Development of a checklist to assess the quality of reporting of
   knowledge translation interventions using the Workgroup for Intervention
   Development and Evaluation Research (WIDER) recommendations},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},

Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Background: Influenced by an important paper by Michie et al., outlining
   the rationale and requirements for detailed reporting of behavior change
   interventions now required by Implementation Science, we created and
   refined a checklist to operationalize the Workgroup for Intervention
   Development and Evaluation Research (WIDER) recommendations in
   systematic reviews. The WIDER recommendations provide a framework to
   identify and provide detailed reporting of the essential components of
   behavior change interventions in order to facilitate replication,
   further development, and scale-up of the interventions.
   Findings: The checklist was developed, applied, and improved over the
   course of four systematic reviews of knowledge translation (KT)
   strategies in a variety of healthcare settings conducted by Scott and
   associates. The checklist was created as one method of operationalizing
   the work of the WIDER in order to facilitate comparison across
   heterogeneous studies included in these systematic reviews. Numerous
   challenges were encountered in the process of creating and applying the
   checklist across four stages of development. The resulting improvements
   have produced a `user-friendly' and replicable checklist to assess the
   quality of reporting of KT interventions in systematic reviews using the
   WIDER recommendations.
   Conclusions: With journals, such as Implementation Science, using the
   WIDER recommendations as publication requirements for evaluation reports
   of behavior change intervention studies, it is crucial to find methods
   of examining, measuring, and reporting the quality of reporting. This
   checklist is one approach to operationalize the WIDER recommendations in
   systematic review methodology.},

Title = {Proposing a conceptual framework for integrated local public health
   policy, applied to childhood obesity - the behavior change ball},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {Background: Childhood obesity is a `wicked' public health problem that
   is best tackled by an integrated approach, which is enabled by
   integrated public health policies. The development and implementation of
   such policies have in practice proven to be difficult, however, and
   studying why this is the case requires a tool that may assist local
   policy-makers and those assisting them. A comprehensive framework that
   can help to identify options for improvement and to systematically
   develop solutions may be used to support local policy-makers.
   Discussion: We propose the `Behavior Change Ball' as a tool to study the
   development and implementation of integrated public health policies
   within local government. Based on the tenets of the `Behavior Change
   Wheel' by Michie and colleagues (2011), the proposed conceptual
   framework distinguishes organizational behaviors of local policy-makers
   at the strategic, tactical and operational levels, as well as the
   determinants (motivation, capability, opportunity) required for these
   behaviors, and interventions and policy categories that can influence
   them. To illustrate the difficulty of achieving sustained integrated
   approaches, we use the metaphor of a ball in our framework: the
   mountainous landscapes surrounding the ball reflect the system's
   resistance to change (by making it difficult for the ball to roll). We
   apply this framework to the problem of childhood obesity prevention. The
   added value provided by the framework lies in its comprehensiveness,
   theoretical basis, diagnostic and heuristic nature and face validity.
   Summary: Since integrated public health policies have not been widely
   developed and implemented in practice, organizational behaviors relevant
   to the development of these policies remain to be investigated. A
   conceptual framework that can assist in systematically studying the
   policy process may facilitate this. Our Behavior Change Ball adds
   significant value to existing public health policy frameworks by
   incorporating multiple theoretical perspectives, specifying a set of
   organizational behaviors and linking the analysis of these behaviors to
   interventions and policies. We would encourage examination by others of
   our framework as a tool to explain and guide the development of
   integrated policies for the prevention of wicked public health problems.},

Title = {Policy to implementation: evidence-based practice in community mental
   health - study protocol},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Background: Evidence-based treatments (EBTs) are not widely available in
   community mental health settings. In response to the call for
   implementation of evidence-based treatments in the United States, states
   and counties have mandated behavioral health reform through policies and
   other initiatives. Evaluations of the impact of these policies on
   implementation are rare. A systems transformation about to occur in
   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, offers an important opportunity to
   prospectively study implementation in response to a policy mandate.
   Methods/design: Using a prospective sequential mixed-methods design,
   with observations at multiple points in time, we will investigate the
   responses of staff from 30 community mental health clinics to a policy
   from the Department of Behavioral Health encouraging and incentivizing
   providers to implement evidence-based treatments to treat youth with
   mental health problems. Study participants will be 30 executive
   directors, 30 clinical directors, and 240 therapists. Data will be
   collected prior to the policy implementation, and then at two and four
   years following policy implementation. Quantitative data will include
   measures of intervention implementation and potential moderators of
   implementation (i.e., organizational-and leader-level variables) and
   will be collected from executive directors, clinical directors, and
   therapists. Measures include self-reported therapist fidelity to
   evidence-based treatment techniques as measured by the Therapist
   Procedures Checklist-Revised, organizational variables as measured by
   the Organizational Social Context Measurement System and the
   Implementation Climate Assessment, leader variables as measured by the
   Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, attitudes towards EBTs as measured
   by the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale, and knowledge of EBTs as
   measured by the Knowledge of Evidence-Based Services Questionnaire.
   Qualitative data will include semi-structured interviews with a subset
   of the sample to assess the implementation experience of high-,
   average-, and low-performing agencies. Mixed methods will be integrated
   through comparing and contrasting results from the two methods for each
   of the primary hypotheses in this study.
   Discussion: Findings from the proposed research will inform both future
   policy mandates around implementation and the support required for the
   success of these policies, with the ultimate goal of improving the
   quality of treatment provided to youth in the public sector.},

Title = {How hard can it be to include research evidence and evaluation in local
   health policy implementation? Results from a mixed methods study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Background: Although an evidence-based approach is the ideal model for
   planning and delivering healthcare, barriers exist to using research
   evidence to implement and evaluate service change. This paper aims to
   inform policy implementation and evaluation by understanding the role of
   research evidence at the local level through implementation of a
   national chronic conditions management policy.
   Methods: We conducted a national email survey of health service
   commissioners at the most devolved level of decision-making in Wales
   (Local Health Boards - LHBs) followed by in-depth interviews with
   representatives of LHBs, purposively selecting five to reflect
   geographic and economic characteristics. Survey data were analysed
   descriptively; we used thematic analysis for interview data.
   Results: All LHBs (n = 22) completed questionnaires. All reported they
   routinely assessed the research literature before implementing
   interventions, but free-text answers revealed wide variation in
   approach. Most commonly reported information sources included personal
   contacts, needs assessments, information or research databases. No
   consistent approach to evaluation was reported. Frequently reported
   challenges were: insufficient staff capacity (17/22); limited skills,
   cost, limited time, competing priorities (16/22); availability and
   quality of routine data (15/22). Respondents reported they would value
   central guidance on evaluation. Five interviews were held with managers
   from the five LHBs contacted. Service delivery decisions were informed
   by Welsh Government initiatives and priorities, budgets, perceived good
   practice, personal knowledge, and local needs, but did not include
   formal research evidence, they reported. Decision making was a
   collaborative process including clinical staff, patient representatives,
   and partner organization managers with varying levels of research
   experience. Robust evaluation data were required, but they were
   constrained by a lack of skills, time, and resources. They viewed
   evaluation as a means of demonstrating that targets had been met.
   Conclusions: There is a gap between evidence-based aims of national
   health policy and how health services are commissioned, implemented, and
   evaluated at local level. Commissioners and managers are unable to
   routinely incorporate research evidence. If health services research is
   to identify most effective ways to implement high quality care, it
   should be incorporated into commissioning and service delivery. Local
   commissioners and managers need to build the critical use of research
   evidence and evaluation into health policy implementation at local level
   in order to provide consistent and effective healthcare services.},

Title = {Implementing training and support, financial reimbursement, and referral
   to an internet-based brief advice program to improve the early
   identification of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption in primary
   care (ODHIN): study protocol for a cluster randomized factorial trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Background: The European level of alcohol consumption, and the
   subsequent burden of disease, is high compared to the rest of the world.
   While screening and brief interventions in primary healthcare are
   cost-effective, in most countries they have hardly been implemented in
   routine primary healthcare. In this study, we aim to examine the
   effectiveness and efficiency of three implementation interventions that
   have been chosen to address key barriers for improvement: training and
   support to address lack of knowledge and motivation in healthcare
   providers; financial reimbursement to compensate the time investment;
   and internet-based counselling to reduce workload for primary care
   providers.
   Methods/design: In a cluster randomized factorial trial, data from
   Catalan, English, Netherlands, Polish, and Swedish primary healthcare
   units will be collected on screening and brief advice rates for
   hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption. The three implementation
   strategies will be provided separately and in combination in a total of
   seven intervention groups and compared with a treatment as usual control
   group. Screening and brief intervention activities will be measured at
   baseline, during 12 weeks and after six months. Process measures include
   health professionals' role security and therapeutic commitment of the
   participating providers (SAAPPQ questionnaire). A total of 120 primary
   healthcare units will be included, equally distributed over the five
   countries. Both intention to treat and per protocol analyses are planned
   to determine intervention effectiveness, using random coefficient
   regression modelling.
   Discussion: Effective interventions to implement screening and brief
   interventions for hazardous alcohol use are urgently required. This
   international multi-centre trial will provide evidence to guide decision
   makers.},

Title = {Specifying content and mechanisms of change in interventions to change
   professionals' practice: an illustration from the Good Goals study in
   occupational therapy},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Background: It is widely agreed that interventions to change
   professionals' practice need to be clearly specified. This involves (1)
   selecting and defining the intervention techniques, (2) operationalising
   the techniques and deciding their delivery, and (3) formulating
   hypotheses about the mechanisms through which the techniques are thought
   to result in change. Descriptions of methods to achieve these objectives
   are limited. This paper reports methods and illustrates outputs from a
   study to meet these objectives, specifically from the Good Goals study
   to improve occupational therapists' caseload management practice.
   Methods: (1) Behaviour change techniques were identified and selected
   from an existing matrix that maps techniques to determinants. An
   existing coding manual was used to define the techniques. (2) A team of
   occupational therapists generated context-relevant, acceptable modes of
   delivery for the techniques; these data were compared and contrasted
   with previously collected data, literature on caseload management, and
   the aims of the intervention. (3) Hypotheses about the mechanisms of
   change were formulated by drawing on the matrix and on theories of
   behaviour change.
   Results: (1) Eight behaviour change techniques were selected: goal
   specified; self-monitoring; contract; graded tasks; increasing skills
   (problem solving, decision making, goal setting); coping skills;
   rehearsal of relevant skills; social processes of encouragement,
   support, and pressure; demonstration by others; and feedback. (2) A
   range of modes of delivery were generated (e. g., graded tasks'
   consisting of series of clinical cases and situations that become
   increasingly difficult). Conditions for acceptable delivery were
   identified (e. g., `self-monitoring' was acceptable only if delivered at
   team level). The modes of delivery were specified as face-to-face
   training, task sheets, group tasks, DVDs, and team-based weekly
   meetings. (3) The eight techniques were hypothesized to target caseload
   management practice through eleven mediating variables. Three domains
   were hypothesized to be most likely to change: beliefs about
   capabilities, motivation and goals, and behavioural regulation.
   Conclusions: The project provides an exemplar of a systematic and
   reportable development of a quality-improvement intervention, with its
   methods likely to be applicable to other projects. A subsequent study of
   the intervention has provided early indication that use of systematic
   methods to specify interventions may help to maximize acceptability and
   effectiveness.},

Title = {A systematic review of hand hygiene improvement strategies: a
   behavioural approach},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Background: Many strategies have been designed and evaluated to address
   the problem of low hand hygiene (HH) compliance. Which of these
   strategies are most effective and how they work is still unclear. Here
   we describe frequently used improvement strategies and related
   determinants of behaviour change that prompt good HH behaviour to
   provide a better overview of the choice and content of such strategies.
   Methods: Systematic searches of experimental and quasi-experimental
   research on HH improvement strategies were conducted in Medline, Embase,
   CINAHL, and Cochrane databases from January 2000 to November 2009.
   First, we extracted the study characteristics using the EPOC Data
   Collection Checklist, including study objectives, setting, study design,
   target population, outcome measures, description of the intervention,
   analysis, and results. Second, we used the Taxonomy of Behavioural
   Change Techniques to identify targeted determinants.
   Results: We reviewed 41 studies. The most frequently addressed
   determinants were knowledge, awareness, action control, and facilitation
   of behaviour. Fewer studies addressed social influence, attitude,
   self-efficacy, and intention. Thirteen studies used a controlled design
   to measure the effects of HH improvement strategies on HH behaviour. The
   effectiveness of the strategies varied substantially, but most
   controlled studies showed positive results. The median effect size of
   these strategies increased from 17.6 (relative difference) addressing
   one determinant to 49.5 for the studies that addressed five
   determinants.
   Conclusions: By focussing on determinants of behaviour change, we found
   hidden and valuable components in HH improvement strategies. Addressing
   only determinants such as knowledge, awareness, action control, and
   facilitation is not enough to change HH behaviour. Addressing
   combinations of different determinants showed better results. This
   indicates that we should be more creative in the application of
   alternative improvement activities addressing determinants such as
   social influence, attitude, self-efficacy, or intention.},

Title = {Developing the Autism Model of Implementation for Autism spectrum
   disorder community providers: study protocol},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Background: Currently, 1 out of 88 children are diagnosed with an autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD), and the estimated cost for treatment services
   is \$126 billion annually. Typically, ASD community providers (ASD-CPs)
   provide services to children with any severity of ASD symptoms using a
   combination of various treatment paradigms, some with an evidence-base
   and some without. When evidence-based practices (EBPs) are successfully
   implemented by ASD-CPs, they can result in positive outcomes. Despite
   this promise, EBPs are often implemented unsuccessfully and other
   treatments used by ASD-CPs lack supportive evidence, especially for
   school-age children with ASD. While it is not well understood why
   ASD-CPs are not implementing EBPs, organizational and individual
   characteristics likely play a role. As a response to this need and to
   improve the lives of children with ASD and their families, this study
   aims to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of the Autism
   Model of Implementation (AMI) to support the implementation of EBPs by
   ASD-CPs.
   Methods/design: An academic-community collaboration developed to partner
   with ASD-CPs will facilitate the development of the AMI, a process
   specifically for use by ASD community-based agencies. Using a mixed
   methods approach, the project will assess agency and individual factors
   likely to facilitate or hinder implementing EBPs in this context;
   develop the AMI to address identified barriers and facilitators; and
   pilot test the AMI to examine its feasibility and acceptability using a
   specific EBP to treat anxiety disorders in school-age children with ASD.
   Discussion: The AMI will represent a data-informed approach to
   facilitate implementation of EBPs by ASD-CPs by providing an
   implementation model specifically developed for this context. This study
   is designed to address the real-world implications of EBP implementation
   in ASD community-based agencies. In doing so, the AMI will help to
   provide children with ASD the best and most effective services in their
   own community. Moreover, the proposed study will positively impact the
   field of implementation science by providing an empirically supported
   and tested model of implementation to facilitate the identification,
   adoption, and use of EBPs.},

Title = {Using psychological theory to inform methods to optimize the
   implementation of a hand hygiene intervention},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Background: Careful hand hygiene (HH) is the single most important
   factor in preventing the transmission of infections to patients, but
   compliance is difficult to achieve and maintain. A lack of understanding
   of the processes involved in changing staff behaviour may contribute to
   the failure to achieve success. The purpose of this study was to
   identify nurses' and administrators' perceived barriers and facilitators
   to current HH practices and the implementation of a new electronic
   monitoring technology for HH.
   Methods: Ten key informant interviews (three administrators and seven
   nurses) were conducted to explore barriers and facilitators related to
   HH and the impact of the new technology on outcomes. The semi structured
   interviews were based on the Theoretical Domains Framework by Michie et
   al. and conducted prior to intervention implementation. Data were
   explored using an inductive qualitative analysis approach. Data between
   administrators and nurses were compared.
   Results: In 9 of the 12 domains, nurses and administrators differed in
   their responses. Administrators believed that nurses have insufficient
   knowledge and skills to perform HH, whereas the nurses were confident
   they had the required knowledge and skills. Nurses focused on immediate
   consequences, whereas administrators highlighted long-term outcomes of
   the system. Nurses concentrated foremost on their personal safety and
   their families' safety as a source of motivation to perform HH, whereas
   administrators identified professional commitment, incentives, and goal
   setting. Administrators stated that the staff do not have the decision
   processes in place to judge whether HH is necessary or not. They also
   highlighted the positive aspects of teams as a social influence, whereas
   nurses were not interested in group conformity or being compared to
   others. Nurses described the importance of individual feedback and
   self-monitoring in order to increase their performance, whereas
   administrators reported different views.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the benefits of using a structured
   approach based on psychological theory to inform an implementation plan
   for a behavior change intervention. This work is an essential step
   towards systematically identifying factors affecting nurses' behaviour
   associated with HH.},

Title = {Brief cognitive behavioral therapy in primary care: a hybrid type 2
   patient-randomized effectiveness-implementation design},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Background: Despite the availability of evidence-based psychotherapies
   for depression and anxiety, they are underused in non-mental health
   specialty settings such as primary care. Hybrid
   effectiveness-implementation designs have the potential to evaluate
   clinical and implementation outcomes of evidence-based psychotherapies
   to improve their translation into routine clinical care practices.
   Methods: This protocol article discusses the study methodology and
   implementation strategies employed in an ongoing, hybrid, type 2
   randomized controlled trial with two primary aims: (1) to determine
   whether a brief, manualized cognitive behavioral therapy administered by
   Veterans Affairs Primary Care Mental Health Integration program
   clinicians is effective in treating depression and anxiety in a sample
   of medically ill (chronic cardiopulmonary diseases) primary care
   patients and (2) to examine the acceptability, feasibility, and
   preliminary outcomes of a focused implementation strategy on improving
   adoption and fidelity of brief cognitive behavioral therapy at two
   Primary Care-Mental Health Integration clinics. The study uses a hybrid
   type 2 effectiveness/implementation design to simultaneously test
   clinical effectiveness and to collect pilot data on a multifaceted
   implementation strategy that includes an online training program, audit
   and feedback of session content, and internal and external facilitation.
   Additionally, the study engages the participation of an advisory council
   consisting of stakeholders from Primary Care-Mental Health Integration,
   as well as regional and national mental health leaders within the
   Veterans Administration. It targets recruitment of 320 participants
   randomized to brief cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 200) or usual care
   (n = 120). Both effectiveness and implementation outcomes are being
   assessed using mixed methods, including quantitative evaluation (e. g.,
   intent-to-treat analyses across multiple time points) and qualitative
   methods (e. g., focus interviews and surveys from patients and
   providers). Patient-effectiveness outcomes include measures of
   depression, anxiety, and physical health functioning using blinded
   independent evaluators. Implementation outcomes include patient
   engagement and adherence and clinician brief cognitive behavioral
   therapy adoption and fidelity.
   Conclusions: Hybrid designs are needed to advance clinical effectiveness
   and implementation knowledge to improve healthcare practices. The
   current article describes the rationale and challenges associated with
   the use of a hybrid design for the study of brief cognitive behavioral
   therapy in primary care. Although trade-offs exist between scientific
   control and external validity, hybrid designs are part of an emerging
   approach that has the potential to rapidly advance both science and
   practice.},

Title = {Validation of the theoretical domains framework for use in behaviour
   change and implementation research},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Background: An integrative theoretical framework, developed for
   cross-disciplinary implementation and other behaviour change research,
   has been applied across a wide range of clinical situations. This study
   tests the validity of this framework.
   Methods: Validity was investigated by behavioural experts sorting 112
   unique theoretical constructs using closed and open sort tasks. The
   extent of replication was tested by Discriminant Content Validation and
   Fuzzy Cluster Analysis.
   Results: There was good support for a refinement of the framework
   comprising 14 domains of theoretical constructs (average silhouette
   value 0.29): `Knowledge', `Skills', `Social/Professional Role and
   Identity', `Beliefs about Capabilities', `Optimism', `Beliefs about
   Consequences', `Reinforcement', `Intentions', `Goals', `Memory,
   Attention and Decision Processes', `Environmental Context and
   Resources', `Social Influences', `Emotions', and `Behavioural
   Regulation'.
   Conclusions: The refined Theoretical Domains Framework has a
   strengthened empirical base and provides a method for theoretically
   assessing implementation problems, as well as professional and other
   health-related behaviours as a basis for intervention development.},

Title = {Theories of behaviour change synthesised into a set of theoretical
   groupings: introducing a thematic series on the theoretical domains
   framework},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Behaviour change is key to increasing the uptake of evidence into
   healthcare practice. Designing behaviour-change interventions first
   requires problem analysis, ideally informed by theory. Yet the large
   number of partly overlapping theories of behaviour makes it difficult to
   select the most appropriate theory. The need for an overarching
   theoretical framework of behaviour change was addressed in research in
   which 128 explanatory constructs from 33 theories of behaviour were
   identified and grouped. The resulting Theoretical Domains Framework
   (TDF) appears to be a helpful basis for investigating implementation
   problems. Research groups in several countries have conducted TDF-based
   studies. It seems timely to bring together the experience of these teams
   in a thematic series to demonstrate further applications and to report
   key developments. This overview article describes the TDF, provides a
   brief critique of the framework, and introduces this thematic series.
   In a brief review to assess the extent of TDF-based research, we
   identified 133 papers that cite the framework. Of these, 17 used the TDF
   as the basis for empirical studies to explore health professionals'
   behaviour. The identified papers provide evidence of the impact of the
   TDF on implementation research. Two major strengths of the framework are
   its theoretical coverage and its capacity to elicit beliefs that could
   signify key mediators of behaviour change. The TDF provides a useful
   conceptual basis for assessing implementation problems, designing
   interventions to enhance healthcare practice, and understanding
   behaviour-change processes. We discuss limitations and research
   challenges and introduce papers in this series.},

Title = {Developing theory-informed behaviour change interventions to implement
   evidence into practice: a systematic approach using the Theoretical
   Domains Framework},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Background: There is little systematic operational guidance about how
   best to develop complex interventions to reduce the gap between practice
   and evidence. This article is one in a Series of articles documenting
   the development and use of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to
   advance the science of implementation research.
   Methods: The intervention was developed considering three main
   components: theory, evidence, and practical issues. We used a four-step
   approach, consisting of guiding questions, to direct the choice of the
   most appropriate components of an implementation intervention: Who needs
   to do what, differently? Using a theoretical framework, which barriers
   and enablers need to be addressed? Which intervention components
   (behaviour change techniques and mode(s) of delivery) could overcome the
   modifiable barriers and enhance the enablers? And how can behaviour
   change be measured and understood?
   Results: A complex implementation intervention was designed that aimed
   to improve acute low back pain management in primary care. We used the
   TDF to identify the barriers and enablers to the uptake of evidence into
   practice and to guide the choice of intervention components. These
   components were then combined into a cohesive intervention. The
   intervention was delivered via two facilitated interactive small group
   workshops. We also produced a DVD to distribute to all participants in
   the intervention group. We chose outcome measures in order to assess the
   mediating mechanisms of behaviour change.
   Conclusions: We have illustrated a four-step systematic method for
   developing an intervention designed to change clinical practice based on
   a theoretical framework. The method of development provides a systematic
   framework that could be used by others developing complex implementation
   interventions. While this framework should be iteratively adjusted and
   refined to suit other contexts and settings, we believe that the
   four-step process should be maintained as the primary framework to guide
   researchers through a comprehensive intervention development process.},

Title = {Implementation outcomes of evidence-based quality improvement for
   depression in VA community based outpatient clinics},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {Background: Collaborative-care management is an evidence-based practice
   for improving depression outcomes in primary care. The Department of
   Veterans Affairs (VA) has mandated the implementation of
   collaborative-care management in its satellite clinics, known as
   Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). However, the organizational
   characteristics of CBOCs present added challenges to implementation. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
   evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) as a strategy to facilitate
   the adoption of collaborative-care management in CBOCs.
   Methods: This nonrandomized, small-scale, multisite evaluation of EBQI
   was conducted at three VA Medical Centers and 11 of their affiliated
   CBOCs. The Plan phase of the EBQI process involved the localized
   tailoring of the collaborative-care management program to each CBOC.
   Researchers ensured that the adaptations were evidence based. Clinical
   and administrative staff were responsible for adapting the
   collaborative-care management program for local needs, priorities,
   preferences and resources. Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were used to refine
   the program over time. The evaluation was based on the RE-AIM (Reach,
   Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) Framework and used
   data from multiple sources: administrative records, web-based
   decision-support systems, surveys, and key-informant interviews.
   Results: Adoption: 69.0\% (58/84) of primary care providers referred
   patients to the program. Reach: 9.0\% (298/3,296) of primary care
   patients diagnosed with depression who were not already receiving
   specialty care were enrolled in the program. Fidelity: During baseline
   care manager encounters, education/activation was provided to 100\%
   (298/298) of patients, barriers were assessed and addressed for 100\%
   (298/298) of patients, and depression severity was monitored for 100\%
   (298/298) of patients. Less than half (42.5\%, 681/1603) of follow-up
   encounters during the acute stage were completed within the timeframe
   specified. During the acute phase of treatment for all trials, the
   Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) symptom-monitoring tool was used at
   100\% (681/681) of completed follow-up encounters, and self-management
   goals were discussed during 15.3\% (104/681) of completed follow-up
   encounters. During the acute phase of treatment for pharmacotherapy and
   combination trials, medication adherence was assessed at 99.1\%
   (575/580) of completed follow-up encounters, and side effects were
   assessed at 92.4\% (536/580) of completed follow-up encounters. During
   the acute phase of treatment for psychotherapy and combination trials,
   counseling session adherence was assessed at 83.3\% (239/287) of
   completed follow-up encounters. Effectiveness: 18.8\% (56/298) of
   enrolled patients remitted (symptom free) and another 22.1\% (66/298)
   responded to treatment (50\% reduction in symptom severity).
   Maintenance: 91.9\% (10/11) of the CBOCs chose to sustain the program
   after research funds were withdrawn.},

Title = {The sustainability of new programs and innovations: a review of the
   empirical literature and recommendations for future research},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Background: The introduction of evidence-based programs and practices
   into healthcare settings has been the subject of an increasing amount of
   research in recent years. While a number of studies have examined
   initial implementation efforts, less research has been conducted to
   determine what happens beyond that point. There is increasing
   recognition that the extent to which new programs are sustained is
   influenced by many different factors and that more needs to be known
   about just what these factors are and how they interact. To understand
   the current state of the research literature on sustainability, our team
   took stock of what is currently known in this area and identified areas
   in which further research would be particularly helpful. This paper
   reviews the methods that have been used, the types of outcomes that have
   been measured and reported, findings from studies that reported
   long-term implementation outcomes, and factors that have been identified
   as potential influences on the sustained use of new practices, programs,
   or interventions. We conclude with recommendations and considerations
   for future research.
   Methods: Two coders identified 125 studies on sustainability that met
   eligibility criteria. An initial coding scheme was developed based on
   constructs identified in previous literature on implementation.
   Additional codes were generated deductively. Related constructs among
   factors were identified by consensus and collapsed under the general
   categories. Studies that described the extent to which programs or
   innovations were sustained were also categorized and summarized.
   Results: Although ``sustainability{''} was the term most commonly used
   in the literature to refer to what happened after initial
   implementation, not all the studies that were reviewed actually
   presented working definitions of the term. Most study designs were
   retrospective and naturalistic. Approximately half of the studies relied
   on self-reports to assess sustainability or elements that influence
   sustainability. Approximately half employed quantitative methodologies,
   and the remainder employed qualitative or mixed methodologies. Few
   studies that investigated sustainability outcomes employed rigorous
   methods of evaluation (e.g., objective evaluation, judgement of
   implementation quality or fidelity). Among those that did, a small
   number reported full sustainment or high fidelity. Very little research
   has examined the extent, nature, or impact of adaptations to the
   interventions or programs once implemented. Influences on sustainability
   included organizational context, capacity, processes, and factors
   related to the new program or practice themselves.
   Conclusions: Clearer definitions and research that is guided by the
   conceptual literature on sustainability are critical to the development
   of the research in the area. Further efforts to characterize the
   phenomenon and the factors that influence it will enhance the quality of
   future research. Careful consideration must also be given to
   interactions among influences at multiple levels, as well as issues such
   as fidelity, modification, and changes in implementation over time.
   While prospective and experimental designs are needed, there is also an
   important role for qualitative research in efforts to understand the
   phenomenon, refine hypotheses, and develop strategies to promote
   sustainment.},

Title = {Implementation of the CALM intervention for anxiety disorders: a
   qualitative study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Background: Investigators recently tested the effectiveness of a
   collaborative-care intervention for anxiety disorders: Coordinated
   Anxiety Learning and Management(CALM) (sic)) in 17 primary care clinics
   around the United States. Investigators also conducted a qualitative
   process evaluation. Key research questions were as follows: (1) What
   were the facilitators/barriers to implementing CALM? (2) What were the
   facilitators/barriers to sustaining CALM after the study was completed?
   Methods: Key informant interviews were conducted with 47 clinic staff
   members (18 primary care providers, 13 nurses, 8 clinic administrators,
   and 8 clinic staff) and 14 study-trained anxiety clinical specialists
   (ACSs) who coordinated the collaborative care and provided cognitive
   behavioral therapy. The interviews were semistructured and conducted by
   phone. Data were content analyzed with line-by-line analyses leading to
   the development and refinement of themes. Results: Similar themes
   emerged across stakeholders. Important facilitators to implementation
   included the perception of ``low burden{''} to implement, provider
   satisfaction with the intervention, and frequent provider interaction
   with ACSs. Barriers to implementation included variable provider
   interest in mental health, high rates of part-time providers in clinics,
   and high social stressors of lower socioeconomic-status patients
   interfering with adherence. Key sustainability facilitators were if a
   clinic had already incorporated collaborative care for another disorder
   and presence of onsite mental health staff. The main barrier to
   sustainability was funding for the ACS. Conclusions: The CALM
   intervention was relatively easy to incorporate during the effectiveness
   trial, and satisfaction was generally high. Numerous implementation and
   sustainability barriers could limit the reach and impact of widespread
   adoption. Findings should be interpreted with the knowledge that the
   ACSs in this study were provided and trained by the study. Future
   research should explore uptake of CALM and similar interventions without
   the aid of an effectiveness trial.},

Title = {Challenges of nurse delivery of psychological interventions for
   long-term conditions in primary care: a qualitative exploration of the
   case of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalitis},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {Background: The evidence base for a range of psychosocial and
   behavioural interventions in managing and supporting patients with
   long-term conditions (LTCs) is now well-established. With increasing
   numbers of such patients being managed in primary care, and a shortage
   of specialists in psychology and behavioural management to deliver
   interventions, therapeutic interventions are increasingly being
   delivered by general nurses with limited training in psychological
   interventions. It is unknown what issues this raises for the nurses or
   their patients. The purpose of the study was to examine the challenges
   faced by non-specialist nurses when delivering psychological
   interventions for an LTC (chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic
   encephalomyelitis {[}CFS/ME]) within a primary care setting.
   Methods: A qualitative study nested within a randomised controlled trial
   {[}ISRCTN 74156610] explored the experiences and acceptability of two
   different psychological interventions (pragmatic rehabilitation and
   supportive listening) from the perspectives of nurses, their
   supervisors, and patients. Semi structured in-depth interviews were
   conducted with three nurse therapists, three supervisors, and 46
   patients. An iterative approach was used to develop conceptual
   categories from the dataset.
   Results: Analyses identified four sets of challenges that were common to
   both interventions: (i) being a novice therapist, (ii) engaging patients
   in the therapeutic model, (iii) dealing with emotions, and (iv) the
   complexity of primary care. Each challenge had the potential to cause
   tension between therapist and patient. A number of strategies were
   developed by participants to manage the tensions.
   Conclusions: Tensions existed for nurses when attempting to deliver
   psychological interventions for patients with CFS/ME in this primary
   care trial. Such tensions should be addressed before implementing
   psychological interventions within routine clinical practice. Similar
   tensions may be found for other LTCs. Our findings have implications for
   developing therapeutic alliances and highlight the need for regular
   supervision.},

Title = {Implementing collaborative care for depression treatment in primary
   care: A cluster randomized evaluation of a quality improvement practice
   redesign},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Background: Meta-analyses show collaborative care models (CCMs) with
   nurse care management are effective for improving primary care for
   depression. This study aimed to develop CCM approaches that could be
   sustained and spread within Veterans Affairs (VA). Evidence-based
   quality improvement (EBQI) uses QI approaches within a research/clinical
   partnership to redesign care. The study used EBQI methods for CCM
   redesign, tested the effectiveness of the locally adapted model as
   implemented, and assessed the contextual factors shaping intervention
   effectiveness.
   Methods: The study intervention is EBQI as applied to CCM
   implementation. The study uses a cluster randomized design as a
   formative evaluation tool to test and improve the effectiveness of the
   redesign process, with seven intervention and three non-intervention VA
   primary care practices in five different states. The primary study
   outcome is patient antidepressant use. The context evaluation is
   descriptive and uses subgroup analysis. The primary context evaluation
   measure is naturalistic primary care clinician (PCC) predilection to
   adopt CCM. For the randomized evaluation, trained telephone research
   interviewers enrolled consecutive primary care patients with major
   depression in the evaluation, referred enrolled patients in intervention
   practices to the implemented CCM, and re-surveyed at seven months.
   Results: Interviewers enrolled 288 CCM site and 258 non-CCM site
   patients. Enrolled intervention site patients were more likely to
   receive appropriate antidepressant care (66\% versus 43\%, p = 0.01),
   but showed no significant difference in symptom improvement compared to
   usual care. In terms of context, only 40\% of enrolled patients received
   complete care management per protocol. PCC predilection to adopt CCM had
   substantial effects on patient participation, with patients belonging to
   early adopter clinicians completing adequate care manager follow-up
   significantly more often than patients of clinicians with low
   predilection to adopt CCM (74\% versus 48\%\%, p = 0.003).
   Conclusions: Depression CCM designed and implemented by primary care
   practices using EBQI improved antidepressant initiation. Combining QI
   methods with a randomized evaluation proved challenging, but enabled new
   insights into the process of translating research-based CCM into
   practice. Future research on the effects of PCC attitudes and skills on
   CCM results, as well as on enhancing the link between improved
   antidepressant use and symptom outcomes, is needed.},

Title = {Use of RE-AIM to develop a multi-media facilitation tool for the
   patient-centered medical home},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Background: Much has been written about how the medical home model can
   enhance patient-centeredness, care continuity, and follow-up, but few
   comprehensive aids or resources exist to help practices accomplish these
   aims. The complexity of primary care can overwhelm those concerned with
   quality improvement.
   Methods: The RE-AIM planning and evaluation model was used to develop a
   multimedia, multiple-health behavior tool with psychosocial assessment
   and feedback features to facilitate and guide patient-centered
   communication, care, and follow-up related to prevention and
   self-management of the most common adult chronic illnesses seen in
   primary care.
   Results: The Connection to Health Patient Self-Management System, a
   web-based patient assessment and support resource, was developed using
   the RE-AIM factors of reach (e.g., allowing input and output via choice
   of different modalities), effectiveness (e.g., using evidence-based
   intervention strategies), adoption (e.g., assistance in integrating the
   system into practice workflows and permitting customization of the
   website and feedback materials by practice teams), implementation (e.g.,
   identifying and targeting actionable priority behavioral and
   psychosocial issues for patients and teams), and
   maintenance/sustainability (e.g., integration with current National
   Committee for Quality Assurance recommendations and clinical pathways of
   care). Connection to Health can work on a variety of input and output
   platforms, and assesses and provides feedback on multiple health
   behaviors and multiple chronic conditions frequently managed in adult
   primary care. As such, it should help to make patient-healthcare team
   encounters more informed and patient-centered. Formative research with
   clinicians indicated that the program addressed a number of practical
   concerns and they appreciated the flexibility and how the Connection to
   Health program could be customized to their office.
   Conclusions: This primary care practice tool based on an implementation
   science model has the potential to guide patients to more healthful
   behaviors and improved self-management of chronic conditions, while
   fostering effective and efficient communication between patients and
   their healthcare team. RE-AIM and similar models can help clinicians and
   media developers create practical products more likely to be widely
   adopted, feasible in busy medical practices, and able to produce public
   health impact.},

Title = {Collaborative planning approach to inform the implementation of a
   healthcare manager intervention for hispanics with serious mental
   illness: a study protocol},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {Background: This study describes a collaborative planning approach that
   blends principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR) and
   intervention mapping to modify a healthcare manager intervention to a
   new patient population and provider group and to assess the feasibility
   and acceptability of this modified intervention to improve the physical
   health of Hispanics with serious mental illness (SMI) and at risk for
   cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Methods: The proposed study uses a multiphase approach that applies CBPR
   principles and intervention-mapping steps-an intervention-planning
   approach-to move from intervention planning to pilot testing. In phase
   I, a community advisory board composed of researchers and stakeholders
   will be assembled to learn and review the intervention and make initial
   modifications. Phase II uses a combination of qualitative
   methods-patient focus groups and stakeholder interviews-to ensure that
   the modifications are acceptable to all stakeholders. Phase III uses
   results from phase II to further modify the intervention, develop an
   implementation plan, and train two care managers on the modified
   intervention. Phase IV consists of a 12-month open pilot study (N = 30)
   to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the modified intervention
   and explore its initial effects. Lastly, phase V consists of analysis of
   pilot study data and preparation for future funding to develop a more
   rigorous evaluation of the modified intervention.
   Discussion: The proposed study is one of the few projects to date to
   focus on improving the physical health of Hispanics with SMI and at risk
   for CVD by using a collaborative planning approach to enhance the
   transportability and use of a promising healthcare manager intervention.
   This study illustrates how blending health-disparities research and
   implementation science can help reduce the disproportionate burden of
   medical illness in a vulnerable population.},

Title = {Randomised controlled trial of tailored interventions to improve the
   management of anxiety and depressive disorders in primary care},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 21},
Abstract = {Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders are highly prevalent
   disorders and are mostly treated in primary care. The management of
   these disorders by general practitioners is not always consistent with
   prevailing guidelines because of a variety of factors. Designing
   implementation strategies tailored to prospectively identified barriers
   could lead to more guideline-recommended care. Although tailoring of
   implementation strategies is promoted in practice, little is known about
   the effect on improving the quality of care for the early recognition,
   diagnosis, and stepped care treatment allocation in patients with
   anxiety or depressive disorders in general practice. This study examines
   whether the tailored strategy supplemented with training and feedback is
   more effective than providing training and feedback alone.
   Methods: In this cluster randomised controlled trial, a total of 22
   general practices will be assigned to one of two conditions: (1)
   training, feedback, and tailored interventions and (2) training and
   feedback. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients who
   have been recognised to have anxiety and/or depressive disorder. The
   secondary outcome measures in patients are severity of anxiety and
   depressive symptoms, level of functioning, expectation towards and
   experience with care, quality of life, and economic costs. Measures are
   taken after the start of the intervention at baseline and at three-and
   six-month follow-ups. Secondary outcome measures in general
   practitioners are adherence to guideline-recommended care in care that
   has been delivered, the proportion of antidepressant prescriptions, and
   number of referrals to specialised mental healthcare facilities. Data
   will be gathered from the electronic medical patient records from the
   patients included in the study. In a process evaluation, the
   identification of barriers to change and the relations between
   prospectively identified barriers and improvement interventions selected
   for use will be described, as well as the factors that influence the
   provision of guideline-recommended care.
   Discussion: It is hypothesised that the adherence to guideline
   recommendations will be improved by designing implementation
   interventions that are tailored to prospectively identified barriers in
   the local context of general practitioners. Currently, there is
   insufficient evidence on the most effective and efficient approaches to
   tailoring, including how barriers should be identified and how
   interventions should be selected to address the barriers.},

Title = {Strengthening evaluation and implementation by specifying components of
   behaviour change interventions: a study protocol},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Background: The importance of behaviour change in improving health is
   illustrated by the increasing investment by funding bodies in the
   development and evaluation of complex interventions to change
   population, patient, and practitioner behaviours. The development of
   effective interventions is hampered by the absence of a nomenclature to
   specify and report their content. This limits the possibility of
   replicating effective interventions, synthesising evidence, and
   understanding the causal mechanisms underlying behaviour change. In
   contrast, biomedical interventions are precisely specified (e.g., the
   pharmacological `ingredients' of prescribed drugs, their dose and
   frequency of administration). For most complex interventions, the
   precise `ingredients' are unknown; descriptions (e.g., `behavioural
   counseling') can mean different things to different researchers or
   implementers. The lack of a method for specifying complex interventions
   undermines the precision of evidence syntheses of effectiveness, posing
   a problem for secondary, as well as primary, research.
   We aim to develop a reliable method of specifying intervention
   components ('techniques') aimed at changing behaviour.
   Methods/Design: The research will be conducted in three phases. The
   first phase will develop the nomenclature. We will refine a preliminary
   list of techniques and definitions. Using a formal consensus method,
   experts will then define the key attributes of each technique and how it
   relates to, and differs from, others. They will evaluate the techniques
   and their definitions until they achieve an agreed-upon list of clearly
   defined, nonredundant techniques. The second phase will test the
   nomenclature. Trained experts (primary researchers and systematic
   reviewers), equipped with a coding manual and guidance, will use the
   nomenclature to code published descriptions of complex interventions.
   Reliability between experts, over time, and across types of users will
   be assessed. We will assess whether using the nomenclature to write
   intervention descriptions enhances the clarity and replicability of
   interventions. The third phase will develop a web-based users' resource
   of clearly specified and nonredundant techniques, which will aid the
   scientific understanding of, and development of, effective complex
   interventions. Dissemination throughout the project will be through
   stakeholder meetings, targeted multidisciplinary workshops, conference
   presentation, journal publication, and publication in an interactive
   web-based platform (a Wiki).
   Discussion: The development of a reliable method of specifying
   intervention components aimed at changing behaviour will strengthen the
   scientific basis for developing, evaluating, and reporting complex
   interventions. It will improve the precision of evidence syntheses of
   effectiveness, thus enhancing secondary, as well as primary, research.},

Title = {A critical synthesis of literature on the promoting action on research
   implementation in health services (PARIHS) framework},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {Background: The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health
   Services framework, or PARIHS, is a conceptual framework that posits
   key, interacting elements that influence successful implementation of
   evidence-based practices. It has been widely cited and used as the basis
   for empirical work; however, there has not yet been a literature review
   to examine how the framework has been used in implementation projects
   and research. The purpose of the present article was to critically
   review and synthesize the literature on PARIHS to understand how it has
   been used and operationalized, and to highlight its strengths and
   limitations.
   Methods: We conducted a qualitative, critical synthesis of peer-reviewed
   PARIHS literature published through March 2009. We synthesized findings
   through a three-step process using semi-structured data abstraction
   tools and group consensus.
   Results: Twenty-four articles met our inclusion criteria: six core
   concept articles from original PARIHS authors, and eighteen empirical
   articles ranging from case reports to quantitative studies. Empirical
   articles generally used PARIHS as an organizing framework for analyses.
   No studies used PARIHS prospectively to design implementation
   strategies, and there was generally a lack of detail about how variables
   were measured or mapped, or how conclusions were derived. Several
   studies used findings to comment on the framework in ways that could
   help refine or validate it. The primary issue identified with the
   framework was a need for greater conceptual clarity regarding the
   definition of sub-elements and the nature of dynamic relationships.
   Strengths identified included its flexibility, intuitive appeal,
   explicit acknowledgement of the outcome of `successful implementation,'
   and a more expansive view of what can and should constitute `evidence.'
   Conclusions: While we found studies reporting empirical support for
   PARIHS, the single greatest need for this and other implementation
   models is rigorous, prospective use of the framework to guide
   implementation projects. There is also need to better explain derived
   findings and how interventions or measures are mapped to specific PARIHS
   elements; greater conceptual discrimination among sub-elements may be
   necessary first. In general, it may be time for the implementation
   science community to develop consensus guidelines for reporting the use
   and usefulness of theoretical frameworks within implementation studies.},

Title = {Embedding effective depression care: using theory for primary care
   organisational and systems change},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {Background: Depression and related disorders represent a significant
   part of general practitioners (GPs) daily work. Implementing the
   evidence about what works for depression care into routine practice
   presents a challenge for researchers and service designers. The emerging
   consensus is that the transfer of efficacious interventions into routine
   practice is strongly linked to how well the interventions are based upon
   theory and take into account the contextual factors of the setting into
   which they are to be transferred. We set out to develop a conceptual
   framework to guide change and the implementation of best practice
   depression care in the primary care setting.
   Methods: We used a mixed method, observational approach to gather data
   about routine depression care in a range of primary care settings via:
   audit of electronic health records; observation of routine clinical
   care; and structured, facilitated whole of organisation meetings. Audit
   data were summarised using simple descriptive statistics. Observational
   data were collected using field notes. Organisational meetings were
   audio taped and transcribed. All the data sets were grouped, by
   organisation, and considered as a whole case. Normalisation Process
   Theory (NPT) was identified as an analytical theory to guide the
   conceptual framework development.
   Results: Five privately owned primary care organisations (general
   practices) and one community health centre took part over the course of
   18 months. We successfully developed a conceptual framework for
   implementing an effective model of depression care based on the four
   constructs of NPT: coherence, which proposes that depression work
   requires the conceptualisation of boundaries of who is depressed and who
   is not depressed and techniques for dealing with diffuseness; cognitive
   participation, which proposes that depression work requires engagement
   with a shared set of techniques that deal with depression as a health
   problem; collective action, which proposes that agreement is reached
   about how care is organised; and reflexive monitoring, which proposes
   that depression work requires agreement about how depression work will
   be monitored at the patient and practice level. We describe how these
   constructs can be used to guide the design and implementation of
   effective depression care in a way that can take account of contextual
   differences.
   Conclusions: Ideas about what is required for an effective model and
   system of depression care in primary care need to be accompanied by
   theoretically informed frameworks that consider how these can be
   implemented. The conceptual framework we have presented can be used to
   guide organisational and system change to develop common language around
   each construct between policy makers, service users, professionals, and
   researchers. This shared understanding across groups is fundamental to
   the effective implementation of change in primary care for depression.},

Title = {Translating research into practice in Leeds and Bradford (TRiPLaB): a
   protocol for a programme of research},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Background: The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) has funded
   nine Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care
   (CLAHRCs). Each CLAHRC is a partnership between higher education
   institutions (HEIs) and the NHS in nine UK regional health economies.
   The CLAHRC for Leeds, York, and Bradford comprises two `research themes'
   and three `implementation themes.' One of these implementation themes is
   Translating Research into Practice in Leeds and Bradford (TRiPLaB).
   TRiPLaB aims to develop, implement, and evaluate methods for inducing
   and sustaining the uptake of research knowledge into practice in order
   to improve the quality of health services for the people of Leeds and
   Bradford.
   Methods: TRiPLaB is built around a three-stage, sequential, approach
   using separate, longitudinal case studies conducted with collaborating
   NHS organisations, TRiPLaB will select robust innovations to implement,
   conduct a theory-informed exploration of the local context using a
   variety of data collection and analytic methods, and synthesise the
   information collected to identify the key factors influencing the uptake
   and adoption of targeted innovations. This synthesis will inform the
   development of tailored, multifaceted, interventions designed to
   increase the translation of research findings into practice. Mixed
   research methods, including time series analysis, quasi-experimental
   comparison, and qualitative process evaluation, will be used to evaluate
   the impact of the implementation strategies deployed.
   Conclusion: TRiPLaB is a theory-informed, systematic, mixed methods
   approach to developing and evaluating tailored implementation strategies
   aimed at increasing the translation of research-based findings into
   practice in one UK health economy. Through active collaboration with its
   local NHS, TRiPLaB aims to improve the quality of health services for
   the people of Leeds and Bradford and to contribute to research knowledge
   regarding the interaction between context and adoption behaviour in
   health services.},

Title = {Unpacking vertical and horizontal integration: childhood
   overweight/obesity programs and planning, a Canadian perspective},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Background: Increasingly, multiple intervention programming is being
   understood and implemented as a key approach to developing public health
   initiatives and strategies. Using socio-ecological and population health
   perspectives, multiple intervention programming approaches are aimed at
   providing coordinated and strategic comprehensive programs operating
   over system levels and across sectors, allowing practitioners and
   decision makers to take advantage of synergistic effects. These
   approaches also require vertical and horizontal (v/h) integration of
   policy and practice in order to be maximally effective.
   Discussion: This paper examines v/h integration of interventions for
   childhood overweight/obesity prevention and reduction from a Canadian
   perspective. It describes the implications of v/h integration for
   childhood overweight and obesity prevention, with examples of
   interventions where v/h integration has been implemented. An application
   of a conceptual framework for structuring v/h integration of an
   overweight/obesity prevention initiative is presented. The paper
   concludes with a discussion of the implications of vertical/horizontal
   integration for policy, research, and practice related to childhood
   overweight and obesity prevention multiple intervention programs.
   Summary: Both v/h integration across sectors and over system levels are
   needed to fully support multiple intervention programs of the complexity
   and scope required by obesity issues. V/h integration requires attention
   to system structures and processes. A conceptual framework is needed to
   support policy alignment, multi-level evaluation, and ongoing
   coordination of people at the front lines of practice. Using such tools
   to achieve integration may enhance sustainability, increase
   effectiveness of prevention and reduction efforts, decrease
   stigmatization, and lead to new ways to relate the environment to people
   and people to the environment for better health for children.},

Title = {Study protocol A randomized trial to evaluate e-learning interventions
   designed to improve learner's performance, satisfaction, and
   self-efficacy with the AGREE II},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Background: Practice guidelines (PGs) are systematically developed
   statements intended to assist in patient, practitioner, and policy
   decisions. The AGREE II is the revised and updated standard tool for
   guideline development, reporting and evaluation. It is comprised of 23
   items and a user's Manual. The AGREE II is ready for use.
   Objectives: To develop, execute, and evaluate the impact of two
   internet-based educational interventions designed to accelerate the
   capacity of stakeholders to use the AGREE II: a multimedia didactic
   tutorial with a virtual coach, and a higher intensity training program
   including both the didactic tutorial and an interactive practice
   exercise component.
   Methods: Participants (clinicians, developers, and policy makers) will
   be randomly assigned to one of three conditions. Condition one, didactic
   tutorial - participants will go through the on-line AGREE II tutorial
   supported by a virtual coach and review of the AGREE II prior to
   appraising the test PG. Condition two, tutorial + practice - following
   the multimedia didactic tutorial with a virtual coach, participants will
   review the on-line AGREE II independently and use it to appraise a
   practice PG. Upon entering their AGREE II score for the practice PG,
   participants will be given immediate feedback on how their score
   compares to expert norms. If their score falls outside a predefined
   range, the participant will receive a series of hints to guide the
   appraisal process. Participants will receive an overall summary of their
   performance appraising the PG compared to expert norms. Condition three,
   control arm - participants will receive a PDF copy of the AGREE II for
   review and to appraise the test PG on-line. All participants will then
   rate one of ten test PGs with the AGREE II. The outcomes of interest are
   learners' performance, satisfaction, self-efficacy, mental effort, and
   time-on-task; comparisons will be made across each of the test groups.
   Discussion: Our research will test innovative educational interventions
   of various intensities and instructional design to promote the adoption
   of AGREE II and to identify those strategies that are most effective for
   training. The results will facilitate international capacity to apply
   the AGREE II accurately and with confidence and to enhance the overall
   guideline enterprise.},

Title = {What work has to be done to implement collaborative care for depression?
   Process evaluation of a trial utilizing the Normalization Process Model},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Background: There is a considerable evidence base for `collaborative
   care' as a method to improve quality of care for depression, but an
   acknowledged gap between efficacy and implementation. This study
   utilises the Normalisation Process Model (NPM) to inform the process of
   implementation of collaborative care in both a future full-scale trial,
   and the wider health economy.
   Methods: Application of the NPM to qualitative data collected in both
   focus groups and one-to-one interviews before and after an exploratory
   randomised controlled trial of a collaborative model of care for
   depression.
   Results: Findings are presented as they relate to the four factors of
   the NPM (interactional workability, relational integration, skill-set
   workability, and contextual integration) and a number of necessary tasks
   are identified. Using the model, it was possible to observe that
   predictions about necessary work to implement collaborative care that
   could be made from analysis of the pre-trial data relating to the four
   different factors of the NPM were indeed borne out in the post-trial
   data. However, additional insights were gained from the post-trial
   interview participants who, unlike those interviewed before the trial,
   had direct experience of a novel intervention. The professional freedom
   enjoyed by more senior mental health workers may work both for and
   against normalisation of collaborative care as those who wish to adopt
   new ways of working have the freedom to change their practice but are
   not obliged to do so.
   Conclusions: The NPM provides a useful structure for both guiding and
   analysing the process by which an intervention is optimized for testing
   in a larger scale trial or for subsequent full-scale implementation.},

Title = {Delivering the WISE (Whole Systems Informing Self-Management Engagement)
   training package in primary care: learning from formative evaluation},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Background: The WISE (Whole System Informing Self-management Engagement)
   approach encompasses creating, finding, and implementing appropriate
   self-care support for people with long-term conditions. A training
   package for primary care to introduce the approach was developed and
   underwent formative evaluation. This entailed exploring the
   acceptability of the WISE approach and its effectiveness in changing
   communication within consultations. The study aimed to refine the
   patient, practitioner, and patient level components of the WISE approach
   and translate the principles of WISE into an operational intervention
   deliverable through National Health Service training methods.
   Methods: Normalisation Process Theory provided a framework for
   development of the intervention. Practices were recruited from an inner
   city Primary Care Trust in NW England. All practice staff were expected
   to attend two afternoon training sessions. The training sessions were
   observed by members of the training team. Post-training audio recordings
   of consultations from each general practitioner and nurse in the
   practices were transcribed and read to provide a narrative overview of
   the incorporation of WISE skills and tools into consultations.
   Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff
   post-training.
   Results: Two practices out of 14 deemed eligible agreed to take part.
   Each practice attended two sessions, although a third session on
   consultation skills training was needed for one practice. Fifty-four
   post-training consultations were recorded from 15 clinicians. Two
   members of staff were interviewed at each practice. Significant elements
   of the training form and methods of delivery fitted contemporary
   practice. There were logistical problems in getting a whole practice to
   attend both sessions, and administrative staff founds some sections
   irrelevant. Clinicians reported problems incorporating some of the tools
   developed for WISE, and this was confirmed in the overview of
   consultations, with limited overt use of WISE tools and missed
   opportunities to address patients' self-management needs.
   Conclusions: The formative evaluation approach and attention to
   normalisation process theory allowed the training team to make
   adjustments to content and delivery and ensure appropriate staff
   attended each session. The content of the course was simplified and
   focussed more clearly on operationalising the WISE approach. The patient
   arm of the approach was strengthened by raising expectations of a change
   in approach to self-care support by their practice.},

Title = {A typology of practice narratives during the implementation of a
   preventive, community intervention trial},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {Background: Traditional methods of process evaluation encompass what
   components were delivered, but rarely uncover how practitioners position
   themselves and act relative to an intervention being tested. This could
   be crucial for expanding our understanding of implementation and its
   contribution to intervention effectiveness.
   Methods: We undertook a narrative analysis of in-depth, unstructured
   field diaries kept by nine community development practitioners for two
   years. The practitioners were responsible for implementing a
   multi-component, preventive, community-level intervention for mothers of
   new babies in eight communities, as part of a cluster randomised
   community intervention trial. We constructed a narrative typology of
   approaches to practice, drawing on the phenomenology of Alfred Schutz
   and Max Weber's Ideal Type theory.
   Results: Five types of practice emerged, from a highly
   `technology-based' type that was faithful to intervention
   specifications, through to a `romantic' type that held relationships to
   be central to daily operations, with intact relationships being the
   final arbiter of intervention success. The five types also differed in
   terms of how others involved in the intervention were characterized, the
   narrative form (e. g., tragedy, satire) and where and how transformative
   change in communities was best created. This meant that different types
   traded-off or managed the priorities of the intervention differently,
   according to the deeply held values of their type.
   Conclusions: The data set constructed for this analysis is unique. It
   revealed that practitioners not only exercise their agency within
   interventions, they do so systematically, that is, according to a
   pattern. The typology is the first of its kind and, if verified through
   replication, may have value for anticipating intervention dynamics and
   explaining implementation variation in community interventions.},

Abstract = {Background: While a number of preventive interventions delivered within
   schools have shown both short-term and long-term impact in
   epidemiologically based randomized field trials, programs are not often
   sustained with high-quality implementation over time. This study was
   designed to support two purposes. The first purpose was to test the
   effectiveness of a universal classroom-based intervention, the Whole Day
   First Grade Program (WD), aimed at two early antecedents to drug abuse
   and other problem behaviors, namely, aggressive, disruptive behavior and
   poor academic achievement. The second purpose-the focus of this
   paper-was to examine the utility of a multilevel structure to support
   high levels of implementation during the effectiveness trial, to sustain
   WD practices across additional years, and to train additional teachers
   in WD practices.
   Methods: The WD intervention integrated three components, each
   previously tested separately: classroom behavior management;
   instruction, specifically reading; and family-classroom partnerships
   around behavior and learning. Teachers and students in 12 schools were
   randomly assigned to receive either the WD intervention or the standard
   first-grade program of the school system (SC). Three consecutive cohorts
   of first graders were randomized within schools to WD or SC classrooms
   and followed through the end of third grade to test the effectiveness of
   the WD intervention. Teacher practices were assessed over three years to
   examine the utility of the multilevel structure to support
   sustainability and scaling-up.
   Discussion: The design employed in this trial appears to have
   considerable utility to provide data on WD effectiveness and to inform
   the field with regard to structures required to move evidence-based
   programs into practice.},

Title = {Fostering implementation of health services research findings into
   practice: a consolidated framework for advancing implementation science},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {Background: Many interventions found to be effective in health services
   research studies fail to translate into meaningful patient care outcomes
   across multiple contexts. Health services researchers recognize the need
   to evaluate not only summative outcomes but also formative outcomes to
   assess the extent to which implementation is effective in a specific
   setting, prolongs sustainability, and promotes dissemination into other
   settings. Many implementation theories have been published to help
   promote effective implementation. However, they overlap considerably in
   the constructs included in individual theories, and a comparison of
   theories reveals that each is missing important constructs included in
   other theories. In addition, terminology and definitions are not
   consistent across theories. We describe the Consolidated Framework For
   Implementation Research (CFIR) that offers an overarching typology to
   promote implementation theory development and verification about what
   works where and why across multiple contexts.
   Methods: We used a snowball sampling approach to identify published
   theories that were evaluated to identify constructs based on strength of
   conceptual or empirical support for influence on implementation,
   consistency in definitions, alignment with our own findings, and
   potential for measurement. We combined constructs across published
   theories that had different labels but were redundant or overlapping in
   definition, and we parsed apart constructs that conflated underlying
   concepts.
   Results: The CFIR is composed of five major domains: intervention
   characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of the
   individuals involved, and the process of implementation. Eight
   constructs were identified related to the intervention (e.g., evidence
   strength and quality), four constructs were identified related to outer
   setting (e.g., patient needs and resources), 12 constructs were
   identified related to inner setting (e.g., culture, leadership
   engagement), five constructs were identified related to individual
   characteristics, and eight constructs were identified related to process
   (e.g., plan, evaluate, and reflect). We present explicit definitions for
   each construct.
   Conclusion: The CFIR provides a pragmatic structure for approaching
   complex, interacting, multi-level, and transient states of constructs in
   the real world by embracing, consolidating, and unifying key constructs
   from published implementation theories. It can be used to guide
   formative evaluations and build the implementation knowledge base across
   multiple studies and settings.},

Abstract = {Complex behaviour change interventions are not well described; when they
   are described, the terminology used is inconsistent. This constrains
   scientific replication, and limits the subsequent introduction of
   successful interventions. Implementation Science is introducing a policy
   of initially encouraging and subsequently requiring the scientific

Title = {Development of a theory of implementation and integration: Normalization
   Process Theory},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Background: Theories are important tools in the social and natural
   sciences. The methods by which they are derived are rarely described and
   discussed. Normalization Process Theory explains how new technologies,
   ways of acting, and ways of working become routinely embedded in
   everyday practice, and has applications in the study of implementation
   processes. This paper describes the process by which it was built.
   Methods: Between 1998 and 2008, we developed a theory. We derived a set
   of empirical generalizations from analysis of data collected in
   qualitative studies of healthcare work and organization. We developed an
   applied theoretical model through analysis of empirical generalizations.
   Finally, we built a formal theory through a process of extension and
   implication analysis of the applied theoretical model.
   Results: Each phase of theory development showed that the constructs of
   the theory did not conflict with each other, had explanatory power, and
   possessed sufficient robustness for formal testing. As the theory
   developed, its scope expanded from a set of observed regularities in
   data with procedural explanations, to an applied theoretical model, to a
   formal middle-range theory.
   Conclusion: Normalization Process Theory has been developed through
   procedures that were properly sceptical and critical, and which were
   opened to review at each stage of development. The theory has been shown
   to merit formal testing.},

Title = {EQUIP: Implementing chronic care principles and applying formative
   evaluation methods to improve care for schizophrenia: QUERI Series},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {3},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Background: This paper presents a case study that demonstrates the
   evolution of a project entitled ``Enhancing Quality of care In
   Psychosis{''} (EQUIP) that began approximately when the U. S. Department
   of Veterans Affairs' Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI),
   and implementation science were emerging. EQUIP developed methods and
   tools to implement chronic illness care principles in the treatment of
   schizophrenia, and evaluated this implementation using a small-scale
   controlled trial. The next iteration of the project, EQUIP-2, was
   further informed by implementation science and the use of QUERI tools.
   Methods: This paper reports the background, development, results and
   implications of EQUIP, and also describes ongoing work in the second
   phase of the project (EQUIP-2). The EQUIP intervention uses
   implementation strategies and tools to increase the adoption and
   implementation of chronic illness care principles. In EQUIP-2, these
   strategies and tools are conceptually grounded in a stages-of-change
   model, and include clinical and delivery system interventions and
   adoption/ implementation tools. Formative evaluation occurs in
   conjunction with the intervention, and includes developmental,
   progress-focused, implementation-focused, and interpretive evaluation.
   Results: Evaluation of EQUIP provided an understanding of quality gaps
   and how to address related problems in schizophrenia. EQUIP showed that
   solutions to quality problems in schizophrenia differ by treatment
   domain and are exacerbated by a lack of awareness of evidence-based
   practices. EQUIP also showed that improving care requires creating
   resources for physicians to help them easily implement practice changes,
   plus intensive education as well as product champions who help
   physicians use these resources. Organizational changes, such as the
   addition of care managers and informatics systems, were shown to help
   physicians with identifying problems, making referrals, and monitoring
   follow-up. In EQUIP-2, which is currently in progress, these initial
   findings were used to develop a more comprehensive approach to
   implementing and evaluating the chronic illness care model.
   Discussion: In QUERI, small-scale projects contribute to the development
   and enhancement of hands-on, action-oriented service-directed projects
   that are grounded in current implementation science. This project
   supports the concept that QUERI tools can be useful in implementing
   complex care models oriented toward evidence-based improvement of
   clinical care.},

Title = {Evaluating the successful implementation of evidence into practice using
   the PARiHS framework: theoretical and practical challenges},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Background: The PARiHS framework (Promoting Action on Research
   Implementation in Health Services) has proved to be a useful practical
   and conceptual heuristic for many researchers and practitioners in
   framing their research or knowledge translation endeavours. However, as
   a conceptual framework it still remains untested and therefore its
   contribution to the overall development and testing of theory in the
   field of implementation science is largely unquantified.
   Discussion: This being the case, the paper provides an integrated
   summary of our conceptual and theoretical thinking so far and introduces
   a typology (derived from social policy analysis) used to distinguish
   between the terms conceptual framework, theory and model - important
   definitional and conceptual issues in trying to refine theoretical and
   methodological approaches to knowledge translation.
   Secondly, the paper describes the next phase of our work, in particular
   concentrating on the conceptual thinking and mapping that has led to the
   generation of the hypothesis that the PARiHS framework is best utilised
   as a two-stage process: as a preliminary (diagnostic and evaluative)
   measure of the elements and sub-elements of evidence (E) and context
   (C), and then using the aggregated data from these measures to determine
   the most appropriate facilitation method. The exact nature of the
   intervention is thus determined by the specific actors in the specific
   context at a specific time and place.
   In the process of refining this next phase of our work, we have had to
   consider the wider issues around the use of theories to inform and shape
   our research activity; the ongoing challenges of developing robust and
   sensitive measures; facilitation as an intervention for getting research
   into practice; and finally to note how the current debates around
   evidence into practice are adopting wider notions that fit innovations
   more generally.
   Summary: The paper concludes by suggesting that the future direction of
   the work on the PARiHS framework is to develop a two-stage diagnostic
   and evaluative approach, where the intervention is shaped and moulded by
   the information gathered about the specific situation and from
   participating stakeholders. In order to expedite the generation of new
   evidence and testing of emerging theories, we suggest the formation of
   an international research implementation science collaborative that can
   systematically collect and analyse experiences of using and testing the
   PARiHS framework and similar conceptual and theoretical approaches.
   We also recommend further refinement of the definitions around
   conceptual framework, theory, and model, suggesting a wider discussion
   that embraces multiple epistemological and ontological perspectives.},

Title = {A conceptual framework for implementation fidelity},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {Background: Implementation fidelity refers to the degree to which an
   intervention or programme is delivered as intended. Only by
   understanding and measuring whether an intervention has been implemented
   with fidelity can researchers and practitioners gain a better
   understanding of how and why an intervention works, and the extent to
   which outcomes can be improved.
   Discussion: The authors undertook a critical review of existing
   conceptualisations of implementation fidelity and developed a new
   conceptual framework for understanding and measuring the process. The
   resulting theoretical framework requires testing by empirical research.
   Summary: Implementation fidelity is an important source of variation
   affecting the credibility and utility of research. The conceptual
   framework presented here offers a means for measuring this variable and
   understanding its place in the process of intervention implementation.},

Title = {Designing theoretically-informed implementation interventions: Fine in
   theory, but evidence of effectiveness in practice is needed},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {1},
Abstract = {The Improved Clinical Effectiveness through Behavioural Research Group
   (ICEBeRG) authors assert that a key weakness in implementation research
   is the unknown applicability of a given intervention outside its
   original site and problem, and suggest that use of explicit theory
   offers an effective solution. This assertion is problematic for three
   primary reasons. First, the presence of an underlying theory does not
   necessarily ease the task of judging the applicability of a piece of
   empirical evidence. Second, it is not clear how to translate theory
   reliably into intervention design, which undoubtedly involves the
   diluting effect of ``common sense.{''} Thirdly, there are many theories,
   formal and informal, and it is not clear why any one should be given
   primacy. To determine whether explicitly theory-based interventions are,
   on average, more effective than those based on implicit theories,
   pragmatic trials are needed. Until empirical evidence is available
   showing the superiority of theory-based interventions, the use of theory
   should not be used as a basis for assessing the value of implementation
   studies by research funders, ethics committees, editors or policy
   decision makers.},

Title = {Role of ``external facilitation{''} in implementation of research
   findings: a qualitative evaluation of facilitation experiences in the
   Veterans Health Administration},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {1},
Abstract = {Background: Facilitation has been identified in the literature as a
   potentially key component of successful implementation. It has not,
   however, either been well-defined or well-studied. Significant questions
   remain about the operational definition of facilitation and about the
   relationship of facilitation to other interventions, especially to other
   change agent roles when used in multi-faceted implementation projects.
   Researchers who are part of the Quality Enhancement Research Initiative
   (QUERI) are actively exploring various approaches and processes,
   including facilitation, to enable implementation of best practices in
   the Veterans Health Administration health care system - the largest
   integrated healthcare system in the United States. This paper describes
   a systematic, retrospective evaluation of implementation-related
   facilitation experiences within QUERI, a quality improvement program
   developed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs.
   Methods: A post-hoc evaluation was conducted through a series of
   semi-structured interviews to examine the concept of facilitation across
   several multi-site QUERI implementation studies. The interview process
   is based on a technique developed in the field of education, which
   systematically enhances learning through experience by stimulating
   recall and reflection regarding past complex activities. An iterative
   content analysis approach relative to a set of conceptually-based
   interview questions was used for data analysis.
   Findings: Findings suggest that facilitation, within an implementation
   study initiated by a central change agency, is a deliberate and valued
   process of interactive problem solving and support that occurs in the
   context of a recognized need for improvement and a supportive
   interpersonal relationship. Facilitation was described primarily as a
   distinct role with a number of potentially crucial behaviors and
   activities. Data further suggest that external facilitators were likely
   to use or integrate other implementation interventions, while performing
   this problem-solving and supportive role.
   Preliminary Conclusions: This evaluation provides evidence to suggest
   that facilitation could be considered a distinct implementation
   intervention, just as audit and feedback, educational outreach, or
   similar methods are considered to be discrete interventions. As such,
   facilitation should be well-defined and explicitly evaluated for its
   perceived usefulness within multi-intervention implementation projects.
   Additionally, researchers should better define the specific contribution
   of facilitation to the success of implementation in different types of
   projects, different types of sites, and with evidence and innovations of
   varying levels of strength and complexity.},
