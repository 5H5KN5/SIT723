Abstract = {Informal caregivers play an increasingly important role in the provision
   of care services, especially for the ageing population. At present, the
   evidence on the resilience of the Internet to family caregivers is still
   limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors related
   to the resilience of the Internet to family caregivers. We searched
   retrieved randomized controlled trials (rct) of the effects of Internet
   interventions on resilience in informal caregivers from the beginning of
   the database to 1 November 2022. A preliminary search identified 3348
   studies, 5 of which met the inclusion criteria. The studies involved 482
   participants from four countries. Our results show that compared to the
   control group, internet intervention can effectively improve the
   resilience level of caregivers {[}SMD = 0.65, 95\%CI(0.04?1.26), P \&
   LE; 0.05]. In our study, Web-based interventions can significantly
   improve the adaptability of informal caregivers. In addition, our
   research also pointed out many resources that can be used, such as
   online learning, online answers and online psychological counseling
   provided for caregivers through the Internet, which can effectively
   reduce their burden of care and thus improve their resilience. In the
   future, these findings can be used to develop projects to improve the
   resilience of caregivers through personalized Internet intervention, so
   as to meet the care needs of patients.},

Abstract = {To assess the effects of a group class physical exercise program on
   health-related quality of life (HRQOL), physical fitness and activity,
   and safety in early breast cancer women after treatment, a double-phase
   trial {[}16-week control phase (CP) followed by a 16-week intervention
   phase (IP)] was designed. Outcomes were evaluated at baseline (T1), 8
   (T2) and 16 (T3) weeks (CP), and 24 (T4) and 32 (T5) weeks (IP). The
   primary endpoint was global health status. Out of 82 enrolled patients,
   37 completed the IP. Global health status decreased (-10,1; 95\% CI
   -19.8 to -0.4; p = 0.040) during the CP and stabilized during the IP.
   Physical and sexual functioning increased during the IP (p = 0.008; p =
   0.017), while cardiorespiratory fitness increased in the CP (p = 0.004).
   Upper limb strength and lower limb functionality increased during both
   phases {[}CP: p < 0.0001, p = 0.001 (surgical and nonsurgical arm), p =
   0.028; IP: p < 0.0001, p = 0.002, p = 0.009]. Body mass index decreased
   in the IP (p = 0.026). Waist circumference increased in the CP (p =
   0.001) and decreased in the IP (p = 0.010); sedentary behaviours and
   moderate and vigorous physical activity did not change. Adherence to
   70\% of the sessions was reported in 54\% of patients. No serious
   adverse events related to the intervention were reported. In conclusion,
   the physical exercise program was able to prevent the decline in global
   health status and to improve other domains of HRQOL and physical
   fitness. As physical exercise is not the standard of care in many
   countries, the implementation of group class programs might be an
   option.},

Abstract = {In South Africa, high rates of adolescent pregnancy and HIV pose
   prominent public health challenges with potential implications for
   mental wellbeing. It is important to understand risk factors for mental
   health difficulties among adolescent mothers affected by HIV. This study
   aims to identify the prevalence of likely common mental disorder among
   adolescent mothers (both living with and not living with HIV) and
   explores hypothesised risk factors for likely common mental disorder.
   Cross-sectional data from adolescent mothers (10-19 years; n=1002)
   utilised within these analyses are drawn from a cohort of young mothers
   residing in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. All mothers
   completed a detailed questionnaire consisting of standardised measures
   of sociodemographic characteristics, mental health, and hypothesised
   risk factors. Logistic regression models were utilised to explore
   associations between hypothesised risk factors and likely common mental
   disorder. Risk factors were clustered within a hypothesised
   socioecological framework and entered into models using a stepwise
   sequential approach. Interaction effects with maternal HIV status were
   additionally explored. The prevalence of likely common mental disorder
   among adolescent mothers was 12.6\%. Adolescent mothers living with HIV
   were more likely to report likely common mental disorder compared to
   adolescent mothers not living with HIV (16.2\% vs 11.2\%, X2=4.41,
   p=0.04). Factors associated with likely common mental disorder were any
   abuse exposure (OR=2.54 {[}95\%CI:1.20-5.40], p=0.01), a lack of
   perceived social support (OR=4.09 {[}95\%CI:2.48-6.74], p=<0.0001), and
   community violence exposure (OR=2.09 {[}95\%CI:1.33-3.27], p=0.001).
   There was limited evidence of interaction effects between risk factors,
   and maternal HIV status. Violence exposure and a lack of perceived
   support are major risk factors for poor mental health among adolescent
   mothers in South Africa. Violence prevention interventions and social
   support may help to reduce risk. Identified risk factors spanning
   individual, interpersonal, and community levels have the potential to
   impact adolescent maternal mental health.},

Abstract = {Adolescents exposed to high levels of adversity are vulnerable to
   developing mental health challenges, with long-lasting adverse
   consequences. Promoting the psychological well-being of adolescents and
   protecting them from adverse experiences is crucial for their quality of
   life. There is a need for evidence on which combinations of protective
   factors can improve the wellbeing of adolescents to inform future
   programming efforts. We used data from a longitudinal study that took
   place in Khayelitsha, South Africa, a semi-urban impoverished community
   in Cape Town. Data were collected from adolescents when they were 12-14
   years of age (n = 333) and again at follow-up when they were aged 16-19
   years (n = 314). A path analysis was used to estimate associations
   between access to service, food security, safe environment, family
   support, and social support and five outcomes related to adolescent
   mental health and risky behaviours. The fitted model was used to
   calculate adjusted mean differences comparing different combinations of
   risk factors. Two protective factors (food security and safe
   environment) were positively associated with three outcomes relating to
   mental health and the absence of risky behaviours. Further investigation
   revealed that the presence of high food security and safer environments
   was associated with higher adjusted mean scores: +16.2\% (p < .0001) in
   no substance use; +16.5\% (p < .0001) in no internalising behaviour,
   +19.5\% (p < .0001) in self-esteem; +12.2\% (p < .0001) in positive peer
   relationships; and +11.4\% (p < .0001) in no suicidal ideation.
   Interventions targeting adolescents, that aim to improve food security
   together with improving the safety of their environment, are likely to
   impact their well-being.},

Abstract = {Acceptability has become a key consideration in the development,
   evaluation and implementation of health and social interventions. This
   commentary paper advances key learnings and recommendations for future
   intervention acceptability research with young people in Africa, aimed
   at supporting the achievement of developmental goals. It relates
   findings of the adolescent acceptability work conducted within the
   Accelerate Hub, since mid 2020, to broader inter-disciplinary
   literatures and current regional health and social priorities. We argue
   that, in order to strengthen the quality and applied value of future
   acceptability work with young people, we need to do three things better.
   First, we need to consolidate prior findings on acceptability, within
   and across intervention types, to inform responses to current public
   health and social challenges and further the conceptual work in this
   area. Second, we need to better conceptualise acceptability research
   with young people, by developing stronger conceptual frameworks that
   define acceptability and its constructs, and predict its relationship
   with intervention engagement. Third, we need to better contextualise
   findings by considering acceptability data within a broader social and
   political context, which in turn can be supported by better
   conceptualisation. In this paper we describe contributions of our work
   to each of these three inter-connected objectives, and suggest ways in
   which they may be taken forward by researchers and practitioners. These
   include aggregating evidence from past interventions to highlight
   potential barriers and enablers to current responses in priority areas;
   involving key actors earlier and more meaningfully in acceptability
   research; further developing and testing behavioural models for youth
   acceptability; and working collaboratively across sectors towards
   programmatic guidance for better contextualisation of acceptability
   research. Progress in this field will require an inter-disciplinary
   approach that draws from various literatures such as socio-ecological
   theory, political economy analysis, health behaviour models and
   literature on participatory research approaches.},
