Abstract = {This study will explore the relationships among strengths self-efficacy,
   resourcefulness, stigma experience and mental health recovery in
   community-dwelling adults with serious mental illnesses. Mental health
   practices have focued on psychopathphysiology. Stigma heavily plagued
   clients with mental illnesses and is one of the greatest barriers to
   mental health recovery. Personal strengths like strengths self-efficacy,
   people's confidence in using their personal strengths, and
   resourcefulness, the ability to carry out daily activities, have been
   linked to positive mental health. However, the linkage between strengths
   self-efficacy, resourcefulness and mental health recovery remains
   uncharted. A cross-sectional, descriptive, mixed methods study will be
   conducted. A funded study by the Sigma Theta Tau, Upsilon Eta Chapter,
   August 2013, involving a convenience sample of 100 participants is
   planned. Included are community dwelling adults between 21 to 65 years
   old having been diagnosed with serious mental illnesses. Clients with
   current co-occurring substance abuse will be excluded. Participants
   complete questionnaires and undergo an interview. Correlations among the
   study variables will be examined. Regression analysis will determine if
   recovery can be predicted by strengths self-efficacy, resourcefulness
   and stigma experience. Interview data will be transcribed and analyzed
   by thematic analysis. This study will look beyond clients' disability to
   focus on their recovery and healing capacities such as strengths
   self-efficacy and resourcefulness. Findings will expand our knowledge
   about mental health recovery. Knowledge gained from this study may pave
   the way for future nursing strategies to aid recovery and inform the
   development of positive, strengths-based interventions.},
