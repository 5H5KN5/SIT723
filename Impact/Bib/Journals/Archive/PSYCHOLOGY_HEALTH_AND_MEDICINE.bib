Abstract = {Informal caregivers play an increasingly important role in the provision
   of care services, especially for the ageing population. At present, the
   evidence on the resilience of the Internet to family caregivers is still
   limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors related
   to the resilience of the Internet to family caregivers. We searched
   retrieved randomized controlled trials (rct) of the effects of Internet
   interventions on resilience in informal caregivers from the beginning of
   the database to 1 November 2022. A preliminary search identified 3348
   studies, 5 of which met the inclusion criteria. The studies involved 482
   participants from four countries. Our results show that compared to the
   control group, internet intervention can effectively improve the
   resilience level of caregivers {[}SMD = 0.65, 95\%CI(0.04?1.26), P \&
   LE; 0.05]. In our study, Web-based interventions can significantly
   improve the adaptability of informal caregivers. In addition, our
   research also pointed out many resources that can be used, such as
   online learning, online answers and online psychological counseling
   provided for caregivers through the Internet, which can effectively
   reduce their burden of care and thus improve their resilience. In the
   future, these findings can be used to develop projects to improve the
   resilience of caregivers through personalized Internet intervention, so
   as to meet the care needs of patients.},

Abstract = {To assess the effects of a group class physical exercise program on
   health-related quality of life (HRQOL), physical fitness and activity,
   and safety in early breast cancer women after treatment, a double-phase
   trial {[}16-week control phase (CP) followed by a 16-week intervention
   phase (IP)] was designed. Outcomes were evaluated at baseline (T1), 8
   (T2) and 16 (T3) weeks (CP), and 24 (T4) and 32 (T5) weeks (IP). The
   primary endpoint was global health status. Out of 82 enrolled patients,
   37 completed the IP. Global health status decreased (-10,1; 95\% CI
   -19.8 to -0.4; p = 0.040) during the CP and stabilized during the IP.
   Physical and sexual functioning increased during the IP (p = 0.008; p =
   0.017), while cardiorespiratory fitness increased in the CP (p = 0.004).
   Upper limb strength and lower limb functionality increased during both
   phases {[}CP: p < 0.0001, p = 0.001 (surgical and nonsurgical arm), p =
   0.028; IP: p < 0.0001, p = 0.002, p = 0.009]. Body mass index decreased
   in the IP (p = 0.026). Waist circumference increased in the CP (p =
   0.001) and decreased in the IP (p = 0.010); sedentary behaviours and
   moderate and vigorous physical activity did not change. Adherence to
   70\% of the sessions was reported in 54\% of patients. No serious
   adverse events related to the intervention were reported. In conclusion,
   the physical exercise program was able to prevent the decline in global
   health status and to improve other domains of HRQOL and physical
   fitness. As physical exercise is not the standard of care in many
   countries, the implementation of group class programs might be an
   option.},

Abstract = {In South Africa, high rates of adolescent pregnancy and HIV pose
   prominent public health challenges with potential implications for
   mental wellbeing. It is important to understand risk factors for mental
   health difficulties among adolescent mothers affected by HIV. This study
   aims to identify the prevalence of likely common mental disorder among
   adolescent mothers (both living with and not living with HIV) and
   explores hypothesised risk factors for likely common mental disorder.
   Cross-sectional data from adolescent mothers (10-19 years; n=1002)
   utilised within these analyses are drawn from a cohort of young mothers
   residing in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. All mothers
   completed a detailed questionnaire consisting of standardised measures
   of sociodemographic characteristics, mental health, and hypothesised
   risk factors. Logistic regression models were utilised to explore
   associations between hypothesised risk factors and likely common mental
   disorder. Risk factors were clustered within a hypothesised
   socioecological framework and entered into models using a stepwise
   sequential approach. Interaction effects with maternal HIV status were
   additionally explored. The prevalence of likely common mental disorder
   among adolescent mothers was 12.6\%. Adolescent mothers living with HIV
   were more likely to report likely common mental disorder compared to
   adolescent mothers not living with HIV (16.2\% vs 11.2\%, X2=4.41,
   p=0.04). Factors associated with likely common mental disorder were any
   abuse exposure (OR=2.54 {[}95\%CI:1.20-5.40], p=0.01), a lack of
   perceived social support (OR=4.09 {[}95\%CI:2.48-6.74], p=<0.0001), and
   community violence exposure (OR=2.09 {[}95\%CI:1.33-3.27], p=0.001).
   There was limited evidence of interaction effects between risk factors,
   and maternal HIV status. Violence exposure and a lack of perceived
   support are major risk factors for poor mental health among adolescent
   mothers in South Africa. Violence prevention interventions and social
   support may help to reduce risk. Identified risk factors spanning
   individual, interpersonal, and community levels have the potential to
   impact adolescent maternal mental health.},

Abstract = {Adolescents exposed to high levels of adversity are vulnerable to
   developing mental health challenges, with long-lasting adverse
   consequences. Promoting the psychological well-being of adolescents and
   protecting them from adverse experiences is crucial for their quality of
   life. There is a need for evidence on which combinations of protective
   factors can improve the wellbeing of adolescents to inform future
   programming efforts. We used data from a longitudinal study that took
   place in Khayelitsha, South Africa, a semi-urban impoverished community
   in Cape Town. Data were collected from adolescents when they were 12-14
   years of age (n = 333) and again at follow-up when they were aged 16-19
   years (n = 314). A path analysis was used to estimate associations
   between access to service, food security, safe environment, family
   support, and social support and five outcomes related to adolescent
   mental health and risky behaviours. The fitted model was used to
   calculate adjusted mean differences comparing different combinations of
   risk factors. Two protective factors (food security and safe
   environment) were positively associated with three outcomes relating to
   mental health and the absence of risky behaviours. Further investigation
   revealed that the presence of high food security and safer environments
   was associated with higher adjusted mean scores: +16.2\% (p < .0001) in
   no substance use; +16.5\% (p < .0001) in no internalising behaviour,
   +19.5\% (p < .0001) in self-esteem; +12.2\% (p < .0001) in positive peer
   relationships; and +11.4\% (p < .0001) in no suicidal ideation.
   Interventions targeting adolescents, that aim to improve food security
   together with improving the safety of their environment, are likely to
   impact their well-being.},

Abstract = {Acceptability has become a key consideration in the development,
   evaluation and implementation of health and social interventions. This
   commentary paper advances key learnings and recommendations for future
   intervention acceptability research with young people in Africa, aimed
   at supporting the achievement of developmental goals. It relates
   findings of the adolescent acceptability work conducted within the
   Accelerate Hub, since mid 2020, to broader inter-disciplinary
   literatures and current regional health and social priorities. We argue
   that, in order to strengthen the quality and applied value of future
   acceptability work with young people, we need to do three things better.
   First, we need to consolidate prior findings on acceptability, within
   and across intervention types, to inform responses to current public
   health and social challenges and further the conceptual work in this
   area. Second, we need to better conceptualise acceptability research
   with young people, by developing stronger conceptual frameworks that
   define acceptability and its constructs, and predict its relationship
   with intervention engagement. Third, we need to better contextualise
   findings by considering acceptability data within a broader social and
   political context, which in turn can be supported by better
   conceptualisation. In this paper we describe contributions of our work
   to each of these three inter-connected objectives, and suggest ways in
   which they may be taken forward by researchers and practitioners. These
   include aggregating evidence from past interventions to highlight
   potential barriers and enablers to current responses in priority areas;
   involving key actors earlier and more meaningfully in acceptability
   research; further developing and testing behavioural models for youth
   acceptability; and working collaboratively across sectors towards
   programmatic guidance for better contextualisation of acceptability
   research. Progress in this field will require an inter-disciplinary
   approach that draws from various literatures such as socio-ecological
   theory, political economy analysis, health behaviour models and
   literature on participatory research approaches.},

Abstract = {The popularity of research topics in clinical psychology has always been
   changing over time. In this study, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation
   (LDA), a well-established statistical modeling approach in machine
   learning, to extract hot research topics in published review articles in
   clinical psychology. In Study 1, we use LDA to extract existing topics
   between 1981 to 2018 from the review articles published on three premium
   journals in clinical psychology. Results provide stable information
   about all topics and their proportions. In Study 2, we use a dynamic
   variant of LDA to identify the development of hot topics from 2007 to
   2018. Results show that meta-analysis, psychotherapy, professional
   development, and depression constantly stay as hot topics all over the
   12 years. We also find that behavior intervention has a clear rising
   trend since 2007. Our results provide a comprehensive summary of the
   popularity of research topics in clinical psychology in the last couple
   of years, and the results here can help clinical researchers form a
   structured view of past research and plan future research directions.},

Abstract = {Frequent weight loss dieting leads to increased BMI and is associated
   with eating pathologies. Theoretical models can aid the development of
   interventions to reduce risk behaviours such as frequent dieting if they
   are able to adequately account for the target behaviour. The Prototype
   Willingness Model (PWM) may be able to account for weight loss dieting
   as this behaviour is often associated with social images. This study
   explored whether the PWM could predict weight loss dieting status over
   and above the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). One hundred and
   ninety-two participants (69\% female; mode age 35-44) completed PWM and
   TPB measures and recorded their height and weight. Males were more
   likely to be non-dieters than females. Frequent dieters had a higher BMI
   than non-dieters and rated themselves as more similar to the overweight
   prototype. Prototype perceptions predicted willingness to eat unhealthy
   foods alone. Similarity to the overweight prototype predicted weight
   loss dieting status over and above TPB measures and sex. Further
   research should explore prototype perceptions in an obese/overweight
   frequent dieting population as this may be a fruitful direction for
   developing interventions to reduce weight loss dieting.},

Abstract = {Dietary behaviour plays a crucial role in both the onset and the
   management of coronary artery disease (CAD). To develop effective
   interventions to modify dietary behaviours of patients, it is
   fundamental to identify and examine the predictive factors that are
   relevant to healthy dietary behaviour. The Health Action Process
   Approach provides a useful framework for understanding and predicting
   the process of health behaviour. The aim of the current study is to
   clarify the role and effect of received social support in the HAPA
   model. A longitudinal sample of 117 CAD patients filled out a
   questionnaire at three time points. Along with HAPA constructs, dietary
   behaviour was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire. To
   investigate the longitudinal associations of the constructs, structural
   equation modelling with latent variables was employed. In the final
   model, outcome expectancies and pre-action self-efficacy jointly
   predicted behavioural intention. In the post-intentional phase, social
   support served as a mediator between intention and action planning.
   Moreover, coping planning mediated the relationship between action
   planning and dietary behaviour. These results confirmed the mediator
   role of social support in the intention-behaviour relationship. This
   finding suggests that social support can be a crucial component to
   facilitate healthy dietary behaviour.},

Abstract = {This article, in an effort to assist the selection and deployment of
   evidence-informed strategies, proposes a new conceptual framework for
   responding to community violenceamong youth. First, the phenomenon of
   community violence is understood in context using a new violence
   typology organized along a continuum. Second, the need for a new
   anti-community violence framework is established. Third, a framework is
   developed, blending concepts from the fields of public safety and public
   health. Fourth, evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses
   concerning community violence is summarized and categorized. Finally, an
   anti-violence framework populated with evidence-informed strategies is
   presented and discussed.},

   systematic reviews},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH AND MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Many children across the world are exposed to school violence, which
   undermines their right to education and adversely affects their
   development. Studies of interventions for school violence suggest that
   it can be prevented. However, this evidence base is challenging to
   navigate. We completed a systematic review of interventions to reduce
   four types of school violence: (a) peer violence; (b) corporal
   punishment; (c) student-on-teacher violence and (d) teacher-on-student
   violence. Reviewers independently searched databases and journals.
   Included studies were published between 2005 and 2015; in English;
   considered school-based interventions for children and measured violence
   as an outcome. Many systematic reviews were found, thus we completed a
   systematic review of systematic reviews. Only systematic reviews on
   interventions for intimate partner violence (IPV) and peer aggression
   were found. These reviews were generally of moderate quality. Research
   on both types of violence was largely completed in North America. Only a
   handful of programmes demonstrate promise in preventing IPV. Cognitive
   behavioral, social-emotional and peer mentoring/mediation programmes
   showed promise in reducing the levels of perpetration of peer
   aggression. Further research needs to determine the long-term effects of
   interventions, potential moderators and mediators of program effects,
   program effects across different contexts and key intervention
   components.},

Abstract = {Guided by Stodden et al's conceptual model, the main purpose of the
   study was to examine the relation between fundamental motor skills (FMS;
   locomotor and objective control skills), different intensity levels of
   physical activity (light PA {[}LPA], moderate-to-vigorous PA {[}MVPA],
   and vigorous PA{[}VPA]), and sedentary behavior (SB) in
   socioeconomically disadvantaged kindergarteners. A prospective design
   was used in this study and the data were collected across the 2013-2014
   academic school year. Participants were 256 (129 boys; 127 girls; M-age
   = 5.37, SD=0.48) kindergarteners recruited from three public schools in
   the southern United States. Results found that FMS were significantly
   related to LPA, MVPA, VPA, and SB. Regression analyses indicate that
   locomotor skills explained significant variance for LPA (6.4\%; p<.01),
   MVPA (7.9\%; p<.001), and VPA (5.3\%; p<.01) after controlling for
   weight status. Mediational analysis supports the significant indirect
   effect of MVPA on the relation between FMS and SB (95\% CI: {[}-0.019,
   -0.006]). Adequate FMS development during early childhood may result in
   participating in more varied physical activities, thus leading to lower
   risk of obesity-related behaviors.},

Title = {Effect of a behavioral intervention on dimensions of self-regulation and

Abstract = {The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the preliminary effect
   of a behavioral intervention on the use of self-regulation strategies
   and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in overweight and
   obese adults with type 2 diabetes. 23 individuals recruited from
   ResearchMatc.org and campus advertisements were randomized into an
   intervention (n=12) and control (n=11) group. The intervention group
   received a behavioral intervention that used goal setting, time
   management, and self-monitoring to target dimensions of self-regulation
   and MVPA. The control received information regarding their PA habits.
   MVPA was measured via BodyMedia Armbands at pre- and post-test. The use
   of self-regulatory strategies for MVPA was assessed at pretest and
   posttest using the Self-Regulation for Exercise Scale. Cohen's d effect
   sizes were calculated to determine the practical impact of the
   intervention. The intervention had a large effect on all dimensions of
   self-regulation across time: including total self-regulation (3.15),
   self-monitoring (4.63), goal setting (3.17), social support (1.29),
   self-reward (1.98), time management (4.41), and overcoming barriers
   (2.25). The intervention had no impact on dimensions of MVPA across
   time. This pilot study demonstrated the ability of a behavioral
   intervention to improve the use of self-regulation strategies for MVPA
   in a sample of adults with type 2 diabetes. These findings can further
   inform the development of health promotion programs to promote
   self-regulation. Future research should focus on determining ability of
   improvements in self-regulation to stimulate behavior change.},

Abstract = {This qualitative study explored patients' experiences of nurse support
   for an Internet-delivered weight management intervention. Eighteen
   patients who had received either basic or regular nurse support (three
   or seven contacts, respectively) for the Internet intervention were
   interviewed. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. The
   findings suggest that more regular support for Internet interventions
   may have the potential to inhibit the development of autonomous
   motivation for weight loss, which might lead to problems in sustaining
   losses after support ends. Further research is now needed to confirm
   whether motivation is influenced by frequency of nurse support in
   Internet interventions in order to inform the development of optimal
   support which promotes sustained weight loss.},

Abstract = {Spouse-assisted interventions can improve health behaviors, but
   mechanisms of action are unknown. This study evaluated mediators of
   dietary and physical activity outcomes during a spouse-assisted
   intervention to improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This is a
   secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial comparing
   usual care (n=128) to a spouse-assisted lifestyle change intervention
   (n=127) comprising nine monthly goal setting telephone calls to
   participants and support planning calls to spouses over 11months.
   Structural equation modeling was used to examine if the intervention
   influenced the putative mediators of participant self-efficacy and
   perceived spousal support at 6months (i.e. action test); if changes in
   putative mediators at 6months were associated with changes in diet and
   physical activity outcomes at 11months (i.e. conceptual test); and if
   treatment condition effects on outcomes at 11months were mediated by its
   effects on the 6-month putative mediators (i.e. indirect effects test).
   Participants were 94.9\% male, 64.9\% white and were 61.3years old on
   average. The action test showed that the intervention increased dietary
   self-efficacy (p<.001) and perceived spousal support for diet (p<.001)
   and physical activity (p<.01) at 6months. The conceptual test showed
   that increases in participant physical activity self-efficacy at 6months
   were associated with increases in physical activity frequency (p=.01)
   and duration (p=.04) at 11months; other putative mediators were not
   associated with changes in outcomes at 11months. The indirect effects
   tests did not support a mediating role for self-efficacy or perceived
   spousal support. Intervention-induced changes in spousal support and
   dietary self-efficacy did not translate into behavior change. Other
   mechanisms may be driving behavior change.},

Abstract = {The increasing prevalence of childhood overweight makes children an
   important target for health promotion programmes. An intervention was
   designed for mothers to provide more vegetables to their daughters'
   diet. A randomized controlled trial compared a self-regulation condition
   with a control condition in 155 mothers aged 25-50 years. Dependent
   variable was children's (aged 6-11 years) vegetable consumption which
   was reported by their mothers at three points in time. After baseline
   (Time 1), the intervention group received theory-based instructional
   leaflets to promote self-regulatory skills for providing a healthy
   nutrition for children. Changes were assessed after two weeks (Time 2)
   and at three-month follow-up (Time 3). The self-regulation intervention
   in mothers led to an increase in vegetable intake among their daughters
   at Time 2 but not at Time 3. However, maintenance of vegetable
   consumption at Time 3 was mediated by the amount of vegetable intake at
   Time 2. Engaging mothers in self-regulatory health promotion programmes
   may be a feasible strategy to facilitate more vegetable intake among
   their daughters.},

Abstract = {Objective: To reanalyse a web-based intervention for physically
   untrained office workers with sub-acute non-specific low back pain in
   low back pain-related exercise behaviour terms. Design: Reanalysis of a
   randomized controlled trial. Setting: Occupational Preventive Medicine
   of University. Methods: Participants were randomized to an intervention
   group (proposed intervention plus standard care) or a control group
   (usual care only). The intervention exercise and education materials
   were developed as an online resource, and included video demonstrations
   recorded in a laboratory. Resources were loaded onto a dedicated section
   of the University Preventive Medicine Service website. All sessions
   included stretching, and exercises to improve postural stability
   (abdominal, lumbar, hip and thigh muscles) strength, flexibility and
   mobility. Outcome measures were self-reported health status (visual
   analogue scale (VAS) of the Euroquol-5D questionnaire); functional
   health status (Oswestry disability questionnaire); and the stage of
   change questionnaire. At ninemonths, outcomes in the intervention group
   were analysed and compared with baseline and outcomes in controls.
   Results: In the intervention group, significant positive effects were
   observed at nine-month follow up for stage of change in the behavioural
   domain as related with low back pain for all phases except for the
   contemplation phase. The positive change in the stage of change
   questionnaire correlated with the improvement observed in Oswestry
   (r=.388) and VAS (r=-.612). Conclusions: The reanalysis of the trial
   suggests that exercise behaviour related to low back pain improve after
   the intervention period. This improvement correlates with changes in
   clinical low back pain-related outcomes.},

Abstract = {An appropriate theoretical framework may be useful for guiding the
   development of physical activity interventions. This review investigates
   the effectiveness of the protection motivation theory (PMT), a model
   based on the cognitive mediation processes of behavioral change, in the
   prediction and promotion of physical activity participation. A
   literature search was conducted using the databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO,
   PubMed, and Web of Science, and a manual search was conducted on
   relevant reference lists. Studies were included if they tested or
   applied the PMT, measured physical activity, and sampled from healthy
   populations. A total of 20 studies were reviewed, grouped into four
   design categories: prediction, stage discrimination, experimental
   manipulation, and intervention. The results indicated that the PMT's
   coping appraisal construct of self-efficacy generally appears to be the
   most effective in predicting and promoting physical activity
   participation. In conclusion, the PMT shows some promise, however, there
   are still substantial gaps in the evidence.},

Abstract = {Obesity and related chronic illnesses are leading causes of death and
   excessive health care costs, necessitating identification of factors
   that can help patients achieve and maintain healthy weight. Greater
   self-efficacy and perceived spousal support in patients have been
   associated with successful weight management. The current study also
   assesses self-efficacy and perceived support in spouses and whether
   these factors are related to patient weight. At baseline of a spousal
   support trial, patients and spouses (N=255 couples) each completed
   measures of self-efficacy and spousal support for their own exercise and
   healthy eating behaviors. We fit a multivariable regression model to
   examine the relationship between these factors and patient weight.
   Patients were 95\% males and 65\% Whites, with average age of 61 years
   (SD=12) and weight of 212 lbs (SD=42). Spouses were 64\% Whites, with
   average age of 59 years (SD=12). Factors associated with lower patient
   weight were older patient age (estimate=0.8 lbs, p<.01), normal blood
   pressure (estimate=17.6 lbs, p<.01), higher patient self-efficacy for
   eating healthy (estimate=3.8 lbs, p=.02), and spouse greater perceived
   support for eating healthy (estimate=10.0 lbs, p=.03). Future research
   should explore the causal pathways between perceived support and health
   outcomes to establish whether patient support behaviors could be a point
   of intervention for weight management.},

Abstract = {We describe the development process and completed structure, of a
   self-help online intervention for bipolar disorder, known as MoodSwings
   (. The MoodSwings program was adapted as an Internet intervention from
   an efficacious and validated face-to-face, group-based psychosocial
   intervention. The adaptation was created by a psychologist, who had
   previously been involved with the validation of the face-to-face
   program, in collaboration with website designers. The project was
   conducted under the supervision of a team of clinician researchers. The
   website is available at no cost to registered participants. Self-help
   modules are accessed sequentially. Other features include a mood diary
   and a moderated discussion board. There has been an average of 1,475,135
   hits on the site annually (2008 and 2009), with some 7400 unique
   visitors each year. A randomised controlled trial based on this program
   has been completed. Many people with bipolar disorder are accepting of
   the Internet as a source of treatment and, once engaged, show acceptable
   retention rates. The Internet appears to be a viable means of delivering
   psychosocial self-help strategies.},

Abstract = {Many individuals are motivated to improve their physical activity
   levels, but often fail to act upon their intention. Interventions
   fostering volitional strategies, such as action planning, coping
   planning, and self-efficacy beliefs, can help to translate intentions
   into behavior. This study examines the effectiveness and the mechanisms
   of a combined planning and self-efficacy intervention to promote
   physical activity among motivated individuals. Participants (N = 883)
   were randomly assigned to the intervention or to a waiting-list control
   condition. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the
   intervention resulted in significantly more physical activity, higher
   levels of action planning, coping planning, and volitional self-efficacy
   beliefs (p < 0.01). In addition, multiple mediation analysis showed that
   action planning, coping planning, and volitional self-efficacy mediate
   between the intervention and physical activity. The study shows that the
   intervention successfully fostered physical activity and unfolds the
   underlying self-regulatory mechanisms of the intervention's
   effectiveness.},

Title = {Improving adolescent contraceptive use: Evaluation of a theory-driven
   classroom-based intervention},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH AND MEDICINE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141-155},
Abstract = {The aim of the research was to evaluate the impact of intervention
   materials, designed to enhance self-efficacy and anticipated regret, on
   contraceptive behaviour and antecedents of contraceptive use in a sample
   of adolescents. It was hypothesised that materials designed to enhance
   self-efficacy and anticipated regret would lead to improvements in
   outcome measures compared with controls. A 4(intervention
   condition)x3(time) mixed design was used to assess the impact of
   intervention materials. Participants (N=414) were recruited from five
   secondary schools in the north of England. They were assigned to an
   active control group, an anticipated regret (AR) manipulation, a
   self-efficacy (SE) manipulation or both AR and SE manipulations. Outcome
   measures included psychological antecedents of contraceptive behaviour
   change, intentions and behaviour. Multivariate analysis of variance
   (MANOVA) revealed increases across several outcome measures over time
   (F{[}14,287]=8.99, P0.001, p2=0.305) including intentions, but these did
   not differ by condition (F{[}42,852]=1.35, P=0.07, p2=0.062). There was
   evidence that the questionnaires may have caused reactivity in
   participants. Amongst sexually active participants with relatively low
   levels of intention to use contraception at the outset, increases in
   several outcome measures including intention and behaviour were observed
   (F{[}3,35]=10.359, P0.001, p2=0.47). Findings support the potential for
   effective delivery of behaviour change theory-driven interventions in
   classroom settings. The possibility that the questionnaires may have
   acted as a form of intervention contributes to recent discussion of this
   issue in the literature, and the findings also strengthen the case for
   post-decisional and behavioural skills interventions to enhance
   behaviour amongst those already motivated to use contraception.},

Title = {Multiple outcome measures and mixed methods for evaluating the

   study targeting health professionals' adoption of a national suicide
   prevention guideline},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH AND MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Interest in behaviour-change interventions targeting health
   professionals' adoption of clinical guidelines is growing.
   Recommendations have been made for interventions to have a theoretical
   base, explore the local context and to use mixed and multiple methods of
   evaluation to establish intervention effectiveness. This article
   presents a case study of a behaviour-change intervention delivered to
   community mental health professionals in one Primary Care Trust, aimed
   at raising adherence to a national suicide prevention guideline. A
   discussion of how the theory-base was selected, the local context
   explored, and how the intervention was developed and delivered is
   provided. Time series analysis, mediational analysis and qualitative
   process evaluation were used to evaluate and explore intervention
   effectiveness. The time series analysis revealed that the intervention
   was not effective at increasing adherence to the guideline. The
   mediational analysis indicates that the intervention failed to
   successfully target the key barrier to adoption of the guidance, and the
   qualitative process evaluation identified certain intervention
   components that were well received by the health professionals, and also
   identified weaknesses in the delivery of the intervention. It is
   recommended that future research should seek to further develop the
   evidence-base for linking specific intervention strategies to specific
   behavioural barriers, explore the potential of theories that take into
   account broader social and organisational factors that influence health
   professionals' practice and focus on the process of data synthesis for
   identifying key factors to target with tailored interventions. Multiple
   and mixed evaluation techniques are recommended not only to explore
   whether an intervention is effective or not but also why it is effective
   or not.},

Title = {Feasibility of telephone-based cognitive behavioral therapy targeting
   major depression among urban dwelling African-American people with

Abstract = {Given the burden of depression among those with HIV, and the impact of
   HIV on urban minority communities there is an urgent need to assess
   innovative treatment interventions that not only treat depression but do
   so in a way that allows for increased access to mental health care. This
   single site, uncontrolled, pilot study sought to determine the
   feasibility and depression outcomes of an 11-session telephone-based
   cognitive behavioral therapy intervention delivered over 14 weeks
   targeting low-income, urban-dwelling, HIV-infected African-American
   people with major depression. The diagnosis of major depression was made
   using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The primary
   outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the
   secondary outcome was the Quick Inventory of Depression
   Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR). Feasibility and satisfaction were
   also assessed. Assessments occurred at baseline, midpoint and at study
   conclusion (14 weeks). Fifteen people were screened for the study. Six
   HIV-infected, low-income, African-American people individuals (five
   females and one male) were eligible and participated in the study. All
   patients finished the study. On average, participants completed nine
   sessions. The sessions lasted for an average of 48min (SD=11.5).
   Compared to mean HAM-D score at baseline (HAM-D=22.8 (SD=3.1), the mean
   HAM-D score was significantly reduced at study conclusion (HAM-D=9.8
   (SD=7.4); (t (5)=4.6, p=0.006); (Cohen d=1.9)). Compared to the mean
   QIDS-SR score at baseline (QIDS-SR=15.5 (SD=4.2) the mean QIDS score was
   significantly reduced at study conclusion (QIDS=7.0 (SD=5.4);(t (5)=3.2,
   p=0.02); (Cohen d=1.3)).The mean satisfaction scores across all
   participants at post-treatment was 5.7 (SD=0.3) with of a maximum score
   of 6. Telephone-based CBT can be delivered to low-income, urban-dwelling
   ethnic minority HIV-infected people resulting in significant reductions
   in depression symptoms with high satisfaction. The efficacy of this
   intervention will be assessed in a planned randomized control trial.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {484-489},
Abstract = {Habit formation is an important goal for behaviour change interventions
   because habitual behaviours are elicited automatically and are therefore
   likely to be maintained. This study documented experiences of habit
   development in 10 participants enrolled on a weight loss intervention
   explicitly based on habit-formation principles. Thematic analysis
   revealed three themes: Strategies used to support initial engagement in
   a novel behaviour; development of behavioural automaticity; and
   selecting effective cues to support repeated behaviour. Results showed
   that behaviour change was initially experienced as cognitively effortful
   but as automaticity increased, enactment became easier. Habits were
   typically formed in work-based contexts. Weekends and vacations
   temporarily disrupted performance due to absence of associated cues, but
   habits were reinstated on return to work. Implications for theory and
   practice are discussed.},

   interventions: An exploratory study},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH AND MEDICINE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {231-242},
Abstract = {To develop effective mass media health campaigns it is important to
   explore the behaviour-change techniques that make campaigns more or less
   effective. This exploratory study observed the behaviour-change
   techniques employed in two current healthy eating television programmes,
   and mapped these techniques onto key theoretical frameworks. Interviews
   were then conducted with six participants who watched the programmes, to
   identify which techniques were perceived to be more and less effective
   and to identify any disjunctures between the behaviour-change techniques
   used in the programmes and factors perceived by the participants to be
   particularly influential upon their healthy eating. The two programmes
   were found to use similar behaviour-change techniques, with a heavy
   reliance on providing general health motivation. Interviews revealed
   that participants perceived several specific barriers to eating
   healthily, felt the need for more specific guidance and emphasised the
   importance of identifying with the role models used in the programmes.
   Recommendations for future mass media health campaigns include the need
   to educate individuals about how to overcome specific barriers that they
   might face when trying to eat a healthy diet and to include a wider
   range of role models to encourage the audience to identify with the
   programme participants.},

Title = {Feasibility and effectiveness of a brief meditation-based stress
   management intervention for patients diagnosed with or at risk for
   coronary heart disease: A pilot study},

Abstract = {Extensive research has led to the development of a psychobiological
   model of cardiovascular disease. This model suggests that psychological
   factors such as depression, anxiety, hostility, and stress may affect
   the development and progression of coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent
   studies have also demonstrated that meditation-based stress reduction
   programs are useful interventions for patients with various medical and
   psychological symptoms. The objective of this pilot study was to gather
   preliminary information regarding the feasibility of implementing a
   brief meditation-based stress management (MBSM) program for patients
   with CHD, and those at high risk for CHD, at a major metropolitan
   hospital that serves a predominately non-local patient population. The
   secondary aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that such
   an intervention might reduce depression, as well as perceived stress,
   anxiety, and hostility, while improving general health scores. The
   overall feasibility results indicate that this MBSM intervention was
   highly feasible with regard to both recruitment and retention of
   participants. In fact, 40\% of patients requested further training. In
   addition, after completion of the 4-week intervention, participants
   reported significant reductions in depression and perceived stress. In
   conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the brief
   meditation-based stress management program was well-received by patients
   and can successfully be used as a supportive program for patients at
   risk or diagnosed with CHD.},
