Abstract = {When developing behavior change interventions in a systematic way, it is
   important to select determinants relevant to the target behavior. Data
   is needed to gain insight into the determinant structures (the relative
   strengths of associations between determinants and behavior) and their
   univariate distributions. This insight is crucial to select the most
   relevant determinants, but at the same time institutions tasked with
   behavior change (e.g. prevention organizations, municipal health
   services) often operate under prohibitive resource constraints, which
   also extend to how easily they can collect data from a sample. This
   paper introduces CIBERlite - an approach that furnishes the intervention
   developer with an idea of the relevance of a limited number of
   determinants using short measurements informed by theory. The first
   study (N = 401) in a series of three explores the convergent validity of
   short and full measurements of determinants derived from the Reasoned
   Action Approach. The short measurements are used in the main study (N =
   415) that serves as a proof-of-concept for the CIBERlite plot, an
   efficient visualization combining data of determinant structures and
   their univariate distributions for eight behaviors. The unexpected
   patterns detected in the main study led to an expert estimation study (N
   = 45), which shows that individual experts have difficulty in predicting
   how people score on determinants. This stresses the importance of
   conducting determinant studies and CIBERlite is a valuable alternative
   to do so if resources are limited.},

Title = {A mixed-methods evaluation of the acceptability and fidelity of the
   James' Place model for men experiencing suicidal crisis},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Background Research supports development of informal, community-based
   suicide prevention interventions that can be tailored to suit men's
   unmet needs. The James' Place model (JPM) is a community-based, clinical
   suicide prevention intervention for men experiencing suicidal crisis.
   Evidence supports the efficacy of the JPM and there are plans to expand
   to additional sites across the UK. This study evaluates therapists
   perceived acceptability of the JPM, and if fidelity to the planned
   delivery of the model is maintained within therapeutic practice.Method A
   mixed-methods design was used. Descriptive analyses of 30 completed
   intervention cases were examined to review fidelity of the model against
   the intervention delivery plan. Eight therapists took part in
   semi-structured interviews between November 2021 and March 2022
   exploring the perceived acceptability, and barriers and facilitators to
   delivering the JPM.Results Descriptive analyses of James' Place audit
   notes revealed high levels of adherence to the JPM amongst therapists,
   but highlighted components of the model needed to be tailored according
   to individual men's needs. Thematic analysis led to the development of
   five themes. The first theme, therapeutic environment highlighted
   importance of the therapy setting. The second theme identified was
   specialised suicide prevention training in the JPM that facilitated
   therapists understanding and expertise. The third theme identified was
   therapy engagement which discusses men's engagement in therapy. The
   fourth theme, person-centred care related to adaptation of delivery of
   JPM components. The final theme, adapting the JPM to individual needs
   describes tailoring of the JPM by therapists to be responsive to
   individual men's needs.Conclusion The findings evidence therapist's
   acceptability and their moderate adherence to the JPM. Flexibility in
   delivery of the JPM enables adaptation of the model and co-production of
   therapy to meet men's needs. Implications for clinical practice are
   discussed.},

Title = {How to improve the diet of toddlers? The feasibility of an online,
   habit-based intervention targeting parental feeding behaviour},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Background: The diet of toddlers is often not in accordance with dietary
   recommendations, putting them at risk of poor health outcomes later in
   life. Parents can struggle to provide their toddler with a healthy diet
   and interventions are needed. Helping parents to form healthy feeding
   habits may facilitate healthy feeding behaviours. Therefore, the aim of
   this study was to establish the feasibility of a 6-week online
   intervention to build healthy feeding behaviours in parents of toddlers.
   Methods: Parents and primary caregivers of children aged 2-3 (N = 75)
   were recruited to complete a 6-week online intervention consisting of 6
   modules targeting habit formation, planning, goal setting,
   self-efficacy, interpersonal influences and picky eating. Demographics
   and feeding behaviours were measured with self-report at baseline and
   follow-up. Intervention acceptability and feasibility ratings were also
   gathered post-intervention.
   Results: Most participants were recruited online, highly educated and in
   a relationship. After 6-weeks, 17 participants completed the follow-up
   questionnaire, 11 of whom indicated that they had completed the whole
   intervention. Improvements were found for some feeding behaviours.
   Generally, participants who completed the programme reported that they
   found it acceptable.
   Conclusions: This study provides insights for future intervention
   development. Firstly, an online healthy feeding intervention seems to be
   acceptable but may need to focus on fewer change techniques. Further,
   engagement should be improved by including target group members and
   compulsory reminders. The target behaviours seem to be relevant. Online
   recruitment seems to be preferable and reaches parents and primary
   caregivers nationwide.},

   midlife: initial feasibility testing},

Abstract = {Background: Physical activity during midlife (ages 45-64) plays a major
   role in the prevention of chronic and serious medical conditions.
   Unfortunately, many midlife adults struggle to be physically active in
   the setting of low levels of psychological well-being and the management
   of multiple confluent sources of stress. Effective, scalable,
   midlife-specific interventions are needed to promote physical activity
   and prevent the development of chronic medical conditions.
   Objectives: In an initial proof-of-concept trial, we assessed the
   feasibility and acceptability of a new, midlife-adapted, phone- and text
   message-based intervention using positive psychology (PP) skill-building
   and motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. We secondarily analyzed
   post-intervention changes in accelerometer-measured physical activity
   and self-reported outcomes.
   Methods: The PP-MI intervention included six weekly phone sessions with
   a study trainer, with completion of PP activities and physical activity
   goals between calls, and in the subsequent six weeks briefer phone
   check-ins were conducted. Text messages over the 12-week intervention
   period were utilized to support participants and identify barriers to
   goal completion. Feasibility (session completion rates) and
   acceptability (participant ratings of intervention ease and utility)
   were assessed via descriptive statistics, and pre-post improvements in
   psychological, functional, and physical activity outcomes at 12 weeks
   were examined via mixed effects regression models.
   Results: Twelve midlife adults with low baseline physical activity
   enrolled in the single-arm trial. Overall, 76.8\% of all possible
   sessions were completed by participants, and mean ratings of weekly
   phone sessions were 8.9/10 (SD 1.6), exceeding our a priori thresholds
   for feasibility and acceptability. Participants demonstrated generally
   medium to large effect size magnitude improvements in
   accelerometer-measured physical activity, psychological outcomes, and
   function.
   Conclusions: A novel, midlife-specific phone- and text-based PP-MI
   intervention was feasible and had promising effects on physical activity
   and other clinically relevant outcomes, supporting next-step testing of
   this program via a randomized controlled trial.},

Abstract = {Background Online communities and social networking sites have great
   potential for supporting health behavior change. However, interventions
   vary greatly in participants' engagement rates and, consequently, their
   effectiveness. Theory-based interventions in real-world contexts are
   needed to further increase engagement and effectiveness.
   Methods We experimentally tested whether a video intervention teaching
   Self-Determination-Theory-based communication strategies increases
   need-supportive communication strategy use over one week (Study 1, N =
   76) and perceived need support, engagement, and goal attainment in a
   behavior change intervention supported by a forum-based online community
   (Study 2, N = 537). In Study 2, participants chose a goal (increasing
   either fruit or vegetable consumption or increasing moderate or vigorous
   physical activity) and joined an online community for 2 weeks. Data from
   both experiments were analyzed with mixed models and follow-up tests.
   Results In Study 1, participants in the intervention but not in the
   control group showed an increase in the number of need-supportive
   communication strategies used both immediately and one week after the
   intervention (condition x time interaction, partial eta (2) = 0.31). In
   Study 2, participants who watched the intervention video had a higher
   number of postings and reported a higher subjective forum use frequency
   (but not a higher number of logins) compared to participants who watched
   the control video. However, the effect on the subjective forum visit
   frequency was not robust. There were no intervention effects on
   perceived need support, goal attainment, or secondary outcomes. The
   results might be explained by low application of need-supportive
   communication strategies.
   Conclusion A brief video intervention may be a suitable, low-cost
   intervention to promote need-supportive communication strategy use,
   benefitting both engagement and behavior change. Future studies should
   incorporate additional means to further improve communication strategy
   uptake and engagement in online communities.},

Abstract = {Objective: Family members of stroke survivors are often not supported
   for their caring role, with many reporting adjustment difficulties. This
   paper describes the development and content of a group-based
   intervention for informal carers of stroke survivors.
   Method: The intervention is based on the theoretical foundation of the
   biopsychosocial model with the aim to understand and address the
   physical, psychological and social factors of caring for stroke
   survivors. Findings from a comprehensive literature review and a
   qualitative study with carers arid stroke professionals were synthesized
   to guide the intervention development. The Template for Intervention
   Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist was used as a framework
   to describe the intervention.
   Results: The intervention integrates cognitive-behavioural approaches
   via the identification of the biopsychosocial (physical, emotional,
   social) factors that can have an impact on the well-being of carers. It
   includes education on stroke-specific topics and advice on coping
   strategies. It consists of six structured two-hour group sessions
   facilitated in a community setting. It provides information and support
   on adjusting to the caring role in the first year post-stroke.
   Intervention materials were designed for addressing carers' specific
   needs using psychological techniques, such as problem-solving, goal
   setting and relaxation exercises.
   Conclusion: We have underlined the importance for describing and
   reporting the process of intervention development for complex
   interventions in the context of stroke rehabilitation. An intervention
   addressing the needs of informal stroke carers (Biopsychosocial
   Intervention for Stroke Carers; BISC) has been developed and described.
   BISC was further evaluated in a single-centre feasibility randomized
   controlled trial.},

Abstract = {Background Behavior change interventions have a vital role in enhancing
   human health and well-being. Nevertheless, concerns have been raised
   about suboptimal reporting of behavior change interventions, making
   analyses, replications, and intervention re-use hard or impossible to
   conduct. Objective This paper introduces acyclic behavior change
   diagrams (ABCDs) to achieve more transparent development, evaluation,
   and reporting of behavior change interventions. ABCDs are a visual
   representation of the assumptions regarding causal-structural chains
   that underlie putative active ingredients of behavior change
   interventions. These causal-structural chains link the behavior change
   principles that are applied in an intervention to the (determinants of)
   behavior targeted in that intervention. Conclusions ABCDs are helpful in
   making implicit assumptions explicit and help communicate assumptions
   with team members and other stakeholders. Moreover, we believe they make
   evaluation easier, and their machine-readability allows for ABCDs to be
   imported directly into (systematic review) databases with negligible
   costs while disclosing complete and accurate data. Finally, the ABCD
   approach fits well with other initiatives to gain a deeper understanding
   and synthesis of the literature on active intervention elements.},

Title = {Using intervention mapping to develop and facilitate implementation of a
   multifaceted behavioural intervention targeting physical activity and
   sedentary behaviour in stroke survivors: Physical Activity Routines
   After Stroke (PARAS): intervention development study},

Abstract = {Objectives: The benefits of increased physical activity for stroke
   survivors include improved function and mental health and wellbeing.
   However, less than 30\% achieve recommended physical activity levels,
   and high levels of sedentary behaviour are reported. We developed a
   multifaceted behavioural intervention (and accompanying implementation
   plan) targeting physical activity and sedentary behaviour of stroke
   survivors.
   Design: Intervention Mapping facilitated intervention development. Step
   1 involved a systematic review, focus group discussions and a review of
   care pathways. Step 2 identified social cognitive determinants of
   behavioural change and behavioural outcomes. Step 3 linked determinants
   of behavioural outcomes with specific behaviour change techniques (BCTs)
   to target behaviours of interest. Step 4 involved intervention
   development informed by steps 1-3. Subsequently, an implementation plan
   was developed (Step 5) followed by an evaluation plan (Step 6).
   Setting: Community and secondary care settings, North East England.
   Participants: Stroke survivors and healthcare professionals (HCPs)
   working in stroke services.
   Results: Systematic review findings informed selection of nine
   `promising' BCTs (e.g. problem-solving). Focus groups with stroke
   survivors (n =18) and HCPs (n = 24) identified the need for an
   intervention delivered throughout the rehabilitation pathway, tailored
   to individual needs with training for HCPs delivering the intervention.
   Intervention delivery was considered feasible within local stroke
   services. The target behaviours for the intervention were levels of
   physical activity and sedentary behaviour in adult stroke survivors.
   Assessment of acceptability and usability with 11 HCPs and 21 stroke
   survivors/relatives identified issues with self-monitoring tools and the
   need for a physical activity repository of local services' and training
   for HCPs with feedback on intervention delivery. A feasibility study
   protocol was designed to evaluate the intervention.
   Conclusions: A systematic development process using intervention mapping
   resulted in a multi-faceted evidence- and theory-informed intervention
   (Physical Activity Routines After Stroke - PARAS) for delivery by
   community stroke rehabilitation teams.},

   development of distress and unhealthy eating behaviors (e.g. overeating,
   disordered eating) that can foster poor cardiometabolic health. While
   emerging intervention research shows early promise in reducing IWS,
   long-term efficacy is unclear and novel strategies remain needed. This
   analysis examined whether participation in a mindful yoga intervention
   was associated with reduced IWS and increased intuitive eating, an
   adaptive eating behavior, and whether these changes correlated with each
   other or with changes in mindfulness and self-compassion. Methods
   Participants were stressed adults with low fruit and vegetable intake (N
   = 78, 64.1\% White, M. Body Mass Index 25.59 +/- 4.45) enrolled in a
   parent clinical trial of a 12-week mindful yoga intervention. Validated
   self-report measures of IWS, intuitive eating, mindfulness, and
   self-compassion were administered at pre-treatment, mid-treatment (8
   weeks), post-treatment (12 weeks), and 4-month follow-up (24 weeks).
   Results Linear mixed modeling revealed significant improvements in IWS
   and intuitive eating across the four timepoints (p < .001). Reduced IWS
   correlated with increased intuitive eating pre- to post-treatment (p =
   .01). Improved self-compassion and mindfulness correlated with intuitive
   eating (both p = . 04), but not IWS (p = .74 and p = .56, respectively).
   Conclusion This study offers preliminary support for the hypothesis that
   mindful yoga may promote intuitive eating and reduce IWS among stressed
   adults with poor diet, and suggests that changes in these factors may
   co-occur over time. Further investigation with controlled designs is
   necessary to better understand the temporality and causality of these
   relationships.},

Abstract = {Introduction: A healthy lifestyle could have a positive impact in
   reducing the incidence of some long-term sequelae secondary to pediatric
   cancer treatments. Motivational communication (MC) is effective at
   improving healthy lifestyle habits, especially when patients experience
   change as a challenge. To date, there is no available intervention
   program using MC that promotes healthy lifestyles in pediatric oncology.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop the first MC training
   program for professionals in pediatric oncology and assess its
   feasibility and acceptability.
   Materials and methods: Following standard procedures involving
   professionals, we developed a professional-targeted training named the
   Motivation Cafes, consisting in six sessions of core MC skills for
   healthcare professionals who wish to positively impact lifestyles of
   families in pediatric oncology. We used a mixed-methods
   quantitative-qualitative study to assess the program feasibility and
   acceptability. Professionals in nutrition and physical activity (N =16)
   attended two rounds of the training and completed surveys to evaluate
   the training. They reported self-efficacy and knowledge in MC.
   Participation and retention rates were used to assess acceptability and
   feasibility, and a thematic analysis of the open-ended questions was
   performed to identify strengths and weaknesses of the program to further
   refine the program. We used non-parametric statistics to compare
   pre-post changes on measures of self-efficacy and knowledge in MC.
   Results: Attendance and retention (average 4.2/6 sessions completed)
   were high, suggesting very good adherence and feasibility. We also found
   high levels of acceptability and pertinence of the program (i.e. >90\%).
   The results suggested probable improvements in self-efficacy and
   knowledge, but these were not statistically significant given the
   limited sample size.
   Conclusion: The training Motivation Cafes is now ready to be pilot
   tested in pediatric cancer care centers.},

Abstract = {Objective: Although veterans living with HIV infection are burdened with
   smoking-related morbidities, few studies have explored theory-informed,
   evidence-based smoking cessation interventions in the Veterans Affairs
   (VA) Health System.
   Method: In this concurrent mixed-method study, we sought to better
   understand factors influencing the adoption of existing evidence-based
   smoking cessation interventions (reminders, telephone quit lines,
   pharmacological) for veterans in VA HIV clinics. We explored the
   alignment of the revised Promoting Action on Research Implementation in
   Health Services Framework (i-PARIHS) with study results.
   Results: Nineteen clinicians working at eight HIV clinics in the VA
   System participated in the study. Seven themes were identified with
   relative quantitative and qualitative data convergence of clinicians'
   perceptions of the importance of integrating evidence-based smoking
   cessation interventions for veterans with HIV infection.
   Conclusion: Identified themes underscore the need for clinicians to
   provide smoking cessation training, supportive care, and motivate
   veterans living with HIV infection to quit smoking. Integrating smoking
   cessation programs into HIV treatment plans in the veteran patient
   population is critical. Dedicated time to fully implement these efforts
   will maximize smoking cessation intervention efforts and will yield
   successful utilization and subsequent patient compliance. Importantly,
   combination strategies will ensure cessation program impact and
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {Background: ehaviour change is a key to addressing many health and
   healthcare problems and interventions have been designed to improve
   health outcomes. These behaviour change interventions have been
   evaluated in many ways, including randomised controlled trials, and over
   recent decades there has been considerable progress in the conduct and
   reporting these studies. This paper is a personal retrospection on the
   changes occurring that have resulted in our current improved methods and
   their potential for future advancement.
   Advances: There has been steady development of methods for conducting
   trials, including advances in statistical methods enabled by increase
   computing power and programmes, greater attention to the recruitment of
   participants and in the specification of outcomes. Trial reporting has
   improved, largely due to publication of guidelines for reporting
   interventions and trials, but until recently the reporting of behaviour
   change interventions has been quite limited. Developments in the
   specification of active ingredients of these interventions, the
   behaviour change techniques, has transformed our ability to report
   interventions in a manner that facilitates evidence synthesis and
   enables replication and implementation. However, further work using
   ontological approaches is needed to adequately represent the evidence
   contained in the mass of accumulated studies. Meanwhile, attention is
   gradually being paid to the comparator groups in trials leading to
   better reporting but with continuing challenges about how control groups
   are selected.
   Conclusions: These developments are important for the advancements of
   behavioural science - but also in consolidating the expertise needed to
   address global social, environmental and health challenges.},

   moderate-to-severe COPD},

Abstract = {Objective: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a long-term
   condition that detrimentally affects health-related quality of life
   (HRQoL), with self-management proposed as an effective treatment. Using
   self-determination theory (SDT), this research explored psychological
   need satisfaction, frustration, and behavioural regulation to explain
   indicators of self-management.
   Design and Main Outcome Measures: Cross-sectional, questionnaire-based
   methods in people on a pulmonary rehabilitation waiting-list. 72
   participants completed SDT, HRQoL, and self-management knowledge
   questionnaires. Path analyses investigated the ability of SDT concepts
   to predict self-management knowledge and HRQoL.
   Results: Chi-square tests found no significant differences (X-2 (13,
   N=72) = 16.7, p > 0.05) between the just - and over-identified models,
   and multiple measures suggested an acceptable fit to the data.
   Relatedness frustration positively predicted controlled regulation and
   autonomy and relatedness satisfaction positively predicted autonomous
   regulation. The associations between the other needs and the different
   regulation types were not statistically significant. Both regulation
   types strongly predicted HRQoL (35\% variance explained) and
   self-management knowledge (22\% variance explained).
   Conclusion: SDT concepts can predict more self-determined
   self-management regulation, self-management knowledge, and HRQoL and
   provide a framework for researchers and healthcare professionals to
   develop future health interventions for people with COPD. Greater
   research is needed to understand basic psychological need frustration in
   health contexts.},

Title = {A scoping review to ascertain the parameters for an evidence synthesis

Abstract = {Background: Psychological interventions have mixed effects on improving
   employee outcomes, partly due to significant variability across studies
   and a lack of focus on mechanisms of action. This scoping review reports
   on the parameters of these interventions and examines intervention
   content to bring clarity to this heterogeneous topic area and direct
   future systematic review work.
   Method: Six databases were searched (Cinahl, Cochrane, Embase, Medline,
   PsychINFO and Web of Science) from April 2010 to August 2020, and a grey
   literature search was undertaken. Screening was undertaken independently
   by two authors. The results summarised country, participant and
   employment characteristics, psychological interventions and work, health
   and wellbeing outcomes. 10\% of the papers were analysed to determine
   the feasibility of coding intervention descriptions for theory and
   behaviour change technique (BCT) components.
   Results: Database searches yielded 9341 titles, of which 91 studies were
   included. Most studies were conducted in Europe (78\%) and included
   males and females (95\%) ranging in age from 31-56.6 years although
   other demographic, and employment information was lacking.
   Musculoskeletal pain was common (87\%). Psychological interventions
   commonly included cognitive behavioural therapy (30\%) and education
   (28\%). Most studies employed a randomised control trial design (64\%).
   Over half contained a control group (54\%). Interventions were delivered
   in mostly healthcare settings (72\%) by health professionals. Multiple
   outcomes were often reported, many of which involved measuring sickness
   absence and return-to-work (62\%) and pain and general health (53\%).
   Within the feasibility analysis, most papers met the minimum criteria of
   containing one paragraph of intervention description, but none
   explicitly mentioned theory or BCTs.
   Conclusion: Psychological interventions for employees with chronic pain
   vary in their nature and implementation. We have shown scoping reviews
   can be used to assess the feasibility of applying tools from health
   psychology to identify the content of these interventions in future
   systematic review work to improve intervention development.},

Title = {Keep on running - a randomized controlled trial to test a digital

Abstract = {Background: This paper describes the rationale, intervention
   development, study design and results from the pilot feasibility study
   of the Keep On Running (KOR) trial. KOR aims to test a web-based brief
   theory-based intervention, targeting maintenance of recreational running
   behavior over time (i.e. relapse preventing).
   Methods: Intervention development was based both on Self-Determination
   Theory and on Self-Regulation Theory. As part of it, a pilot study was
   implemented (n=18) to measure intervention adherence and participant
   satisfaction in order to establish the feasibility and acceptability of
   the intervention toolkit. Furthermore, this pilot study was also used to
   test the feasibility and acceptability of the questionnaires selected to
   be part of the later RCT.
   Results: Pilot intervention acceptability was good, but overall
   adherence was low. Features such as feedback and social sharing should
   be added to the toolkit. The main trial should lessen questionnaire
   length and include data from usual monitoring gadgets and apps (APIs).
   The protocol of the RCT was adjusted to test the efficacy of the refined
   final version of the intervention, and the RCT that will test it,
   contributing to the understanding of recreational running
   sustainability, allowing the optimization of future interventions aimed
   at physical activity promotion.},

Abstract = {Background:School-based interventions that increase physical activity
   (PA) in a sustainable way are lacking. Systematic and participatory,
   theory and evidence-based intervention development may enhance the
   effectiveness of complex behavioural interventions in the long term.
   However, detailed descriptions of the intervention development process
   are rarely openly published, hindering transparency and progress in the
   field.
   Aims:To illustrate a stepwise process to develop intervention targeting
   PA and sedentary behaviour (SB) among older adolescents, and to describe
   the final, optimised version of the intervention, detailing content of
   sessions by theoretical determinants and techniques. Methods:Two
   established intervention development frameworks (Intervention Mapping
   and Behaviour Change Wheel) were integrated, leading to a comprehensive
   evidence and theory-based process. It was informed by empirical studies,
   literature reviews, expert and stakeholder consultation, including
   scenario evaluation and component pre-testing. In all steps, contextual
   fit and potential for sustainability were ensured by stakeholder
   engagement.
   Results:As a large majority of youth opposed decreasing screen time,
   increasing PA and decreasing SB were defined as target behaviours, with
   peers and the school context including classroom practices as key social
   environments in influencing youth PA (problem specification, step 1).
   Behavioural diagnosis (step 2) identified a variety of determinants in
   the domains of capability (e.g. self-regulation skills), motivation
   (e.g. outcome expectations) and environmental opportunities. These were
   organised into an intervention theory integrating several formal
   theories, including Self-Determination Theory. Theory-aligned principles
   guided material design (Step 3). Feasibility RCT allowed optimisation
   into a final intervention protocol (step 4).
   Conclusions:Intervention elements target students directly, and
   indirectly by changing teacher behaviour and the school and wider
   environment. A systematic development and optimisation led to a high
   potential for sustainability. The detailed intervention content, with
   specification of the hypothesised mechanisms, allows for other
   researchers to replicate, adapt or refine parts or the whole
   intervention, considering specific target groups and (sub-)cultures.},

Title = {Improving photoprotection in adults with xeroderma pigmentosum:
   personalisation and tailoring in the `XPAND' intervention},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Background: Individualised behaviour change interventions can result in
   greater effects than one-size-fits-all approaches. Factors linked to
   success include dynamic (vs. static) tailoring, and tailoring on
   behaviour, multiple theoretical variables, and participant
   characteristics. XP is a very rare (similar to 100 UK patients) genetic
   disease, involving an inability to repair ultraviolet radiation
   (UVR)-induced damage, resulting in skin cancers and eye damage from an
   early age, and mean life expectancy of 32-years. Management involves
   rigorous UVR photoprotection, which is often inadequate, and no
   interventions have been published. UK-based care is personalised and
   delivered by a multidisciplinary team at the National XP Service in
   London. Following an intensive, mixed-methods formative phase with
   patients diagnosed with XP (n-of-1, qualitative interviews, objective
   UVR measurement, cross-sectional survey) and relevant stakeholder
   consultation (clinical and patient/public teams), the `XPAND'
   intervention was developed. This paper describes the comprehensive and
   novel tailoring and personalisation processes used to deliver the
   intervention.
   Methods: XPAND consists of core and personalised modules targeting
   cue-based (time of day, weather, symptoms), belief-based (motivation,
   priority), self-regulatory (effort, barriers, planning), and emotional
   (stress, self-consciousness, mental exhaustion) factors, social support,
   disclosure, habit, and willingness, using appropriately-matched BCTs.
   A-priori, phase I data and a baseline profiling questionnaire (data
   sources) were used to allocate modules to participants
   ('personalisation') and to adapt module content ('tailoring'). Iterative
   decisions about delivery were based on patient response to feedback,
   identification of additional barriers (e.g. reasons for varying
   protection across contexts), and emergence of new barriers as
   improvements in protection were attempted or achieved (e.g. appearance
   concerns).
   Conclusions: Dynamic multi-level personalisation and tailoring based on
   mixed-methods in XPAND allowed for insights and decision-making not
   possible with cross-sectional quantitative or qualitative methods alone.
   Data collection and allocation/adaptation methods may be of use in other
   rare conditions where small patient numbers mean that
   within-participant, individual-level delivery is well-suited and
   feasible.},

Title = {Why? What? How? Using an Intervention Mapping approach to develop a
   personalised intervention to improve adherence to photoprotection in
   patients with Xeroderma Pigmentosum},

Abstract = {Background: Intervention Mapping (IM) is a systematic approach for
   developing theory-based interventions across a variety of contexts and
   settings. This paper describes the development of a complex intervention
   designed to reduce the dose of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the
   face of adults with Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP), by improving
   photoprotection. XP is a genetic condition that without extreme UVR
   photoprotection, leads to high risk of developing skin cancer.
   Methods: The IM protocol of 6 steps was applied, involving comprehensive
   mixed-methods formative research. Key stakeholders (XP clinical staff
   and Patient and Public Involvement Panel), were instrumental at every
   step. Behaviour change methods were informed by the IM taxonomy,
   therapeutic approaches (e.g. ACT, CBT) and coded according to the
   taxonomy of behaviour change techniques (version 1).
   Results: We designed a personalised modular intervention to target
   psychosocial determinants of photoprotective activities that influence
   the amount of UVR reaching the face. Content was developed to target
   determinants of motivation to protect and factors preventing the
   enactment of behaviours. Participants received personalised content
   addressing determinants/barriers most relevant to them, as well as core
   `behaviour-change' material, considered important for all (e.g. SMART
   goals). Core and personalised content was delivered via 7 one-to-one
   sessions with a trained facilitator using a manual and purpose designed
   materials: Magazine; text messages; sunscreen application video;
   goal-setting tools (e.g. UVR dial and face protection guide); activity
   sheets. Novel features included use of ACT-based values to enhance
   intrinsic motivation, targeting of emotional barriers to
   photoprotection, addressing appearance concerns and facilitating habit
   formation.
   Conclusion: IM was an effective approach for complex intervention
   design. The structure (e.g. use of matrices) tethered the intervention
   tightly to theory and evidence-based approaches. The significant amount
   of time required needs to be considered and may hinder translation of IM
   into clinical and non-academic settings.},

Abstract = {Background: Visualisations and readily-accessible web-based
   supplementary files can improve data reporting and transparency. In this
   paper, we make use of recent developments in software and psychological
   network analysis to describe the baseline cohort of a trial testing the
   Let's Move It intervention, which aimed to increase physical activity
   (PA) and reduce sedentary behaviours (SB) among vocational school
   students.
   Methods: At baseline, 1166 adolescents, distributed across 6 school
   clusters and four educational tracks, completed measures of PA and SB,
   theoretical predictors of these behaviours, and body composition. Within
   a comprehensive website supplement, which includes all code and
   analyses, data were tabulated and visualised, and network analyses
   explored relations between predictor variables and outcomes.
   Results: Average daily moderate-to-vigorous PA was 65 min (CI95: 57
   min-73 min), and SB 8h44 min (CI95: 8h04min-9h24 min), with 25.8 (CI95:
   23.5-28.0) interruptions to sitting. Cluster randomisation appeared to
   result in balanced distributions for baseline characteristics between
   intervention and control groups, but differences emerged across the four
   educational tracks. Self-reported behaviour change technique (BCT) use
   was low for many but not all techniques. A network analysis revealed
   direct relationships between PA and behavioural experiments, planning
   and autonomous motivation, and several BCTs were connected to PA via
   autonomous motivation. Visualisation uncovered a case of Simpson's
   paradox.
   Conclusions: Data-visualisation and data exploration techniques (e.g.
   network analysis) can help reveal the dynamics involved in complex
   multi-causal systems - a challenging task with traditional data
   presentations. The benefits of presenting complex data visually should
   encourage researchers to publish extensive analyses and descriptions as
   website supplements, which would increase the speed and quality of
   scientific communication, as well as help to address the crisis of
   reduced confidence in research findings. We hope that this example will
   serve as a template for other investigators to improve upon in the
   future.},

Title = {Development and pilot testing of a novel behavioral intervention for
   adults with type 2 diabetes using intervention mapping},
Journal = {HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Purpose: A healthy diet and consistent physical activity (PA) form the
   foundation for effective self-management in adults with type 2 diabetes
   mellitus (T2DM). Behavioral interventions, which target diet and PA, can
   facilitate effective diabetes self-management practices. Greater clarity
   regarding the ` active ingredients' incorporated into behavioral
   interventions is needed to inform the evidence base about effective
   intervention techniques to advance behavioral theories and to improve
   clinical practice. The use of intervention mapping (IM) to develop a
   novel diabetes intervention to increase consumption of low glycemic
   index (GI) foods and to increase moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA is
   presented.
   Methods: Determinants from self-regulation and the Health Action Process
   Approach theoretical framework formed the foundation of the
   intervention. The IM taxonomy of behavior change methods and strategies
   from Hope Therapy (e. g. goal maps) were used to guide techniques for
   changing selected theoretical determinants of behavior. A pilot study of
   the intervention among adults with T2DM (n = 12) was conducted using a
   pre-/post-test design to evaluate intervention components and
   participant acceptability.
   Results: Participants attended a mean (+/- SD) of 8 (+/- 1.4) of the 10
   weekly 90-minute, group-based sessions. The magnitude of effect was
   moderate (d > 0.50) for the change in behavioral intentions, action
   control, and action and coping planning for engaging in PA and large (d
   > 0.80) for the change in action self-efficacy and action and coping
   planning for eating low GI foods postintervention.
   Conclusions: Greater emphasis on value-based decision-making, the goal
   mapping process, and successively progressive exercise goals should be
   included in future versions of the intervention. Based on pilot testing,
   a larger randomized controlled trial that incorporates these
   intervention modifications is warranted and the modified intervention
   has a greater likelihood for success.},

Abstract = {After weight loss, most individuals regain lost weight. Interventions to
   support the transition fromsuccessful loss to weight loss maintenance
   (WLM), regardless of the method of prior weight loss, are needed. The
   aims of this study were to (1) develop a face-to-face behavioural
   intervention session to support overweight and obese individuals who
   have recently lost a clinically significant amount of weight in the
   transition to WLM; (2) to assess the single-session intervention for
   acceptability and feasibility prior to its use in a larger, 12-month,
   multi-component trial; and (3) to optimise the intervention session for
   future use based on participant feedback. Participants with a Body Mass
   Index of >= 25 kg/m(2) prior to a >= 5\% weight loss in the previous 12
   months were recruited via the local government authority and
   community-based advertisements. Each attended the one-hour session with
   a trained facilitator, which focused on setting maintenance-relevant
   weight, eating, and physical activity goals. Semi-structured interviews
   were carried out immediately post-session to obtain feedback on the
   acceptability of this intervention component. Data were used to generate
   recommendations for changes to the session, which were discussed by the
   team, and used to optimise the session. Seventeen participants (13
   female; median WL = 13\%) were recruited. All participants evaluated the
   intervention session positively; 11 participants suggested improvements
   including reducing information provision in favour of greater focus on
   identifying and coping with barriers, and the inclusion of practical
   examples. The systematic refinement and optimisation process resulted in
   an acceptable and feasible face-to-face behavioural intervention session
   (described here), which will be tested as part of a multi-component
   intervention. We anticipate the session could be used to supplement
   existing support including online services, and has the potential to
   benefit people who have lost a clinically significant amount of weight
   to achieve WLM over the long term.},

Abstract = {Introduction: According to self-determination theory (SDT), individuals
   in position of authority can have a powerful impact on the motivation of
   the individuals they instruct via the type of communication style they
   use. This paper describes (a) the rationale for and development of an
   SDT-based motivation communication training package for group exercise
   instructors and (b) the design and protocol for an intervention study to
   evaluate the implementation of this intervention. Methods and analysis:
   Fifty indoor cycling class instructors will be assigned to either an
   intervention group (n = 25) or a control group (n = 25). Over a 10-week
   period, instructors in the intervention group will complete a multiphase
   SDT-based communication training programme. The evaluation package will
   comprise qualitative and quantitative assessments of the motivationally
   relevant features of the class environment as well as motivation and
   well-being variables, undertaken by both exercise class members and
   instructors. Baseline quantitative data collection will take place up to
   one month prior to the start of the intervention and be re-administered
   within one month following the end of the intervention period.
   Quantitative data will be analysed using multilevel growth modelling.
   Follow-up semi-structured interviews with instructors and exercise class
   members will be conducted four to six weeks following the end of the
   intervention to explore perceptions of the training programme. All
   interviews will be analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Ethics
   and dissemination: The study has been granted ethical approval from
   Curtin University Ethics Board. The findings of the study will be
   disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and conference
   presentations. Trial},

Title = {A quarter-century of HIV prevention intervention efforts among children
   and adolescents across the globe},

Abstract = {In 1988 a group of pediatricians, developmental, clinical, child and
   social psychologists, anthropologists and health educators began
   researching in Baltimore, Maryland, on an Human Immunodefiency Virus
   (HIV) prevention intervention, Focus on Youth (FOY). Over the next 25
   years, the questions being addressed by FOY reflected those of the
   global HIV research experience. During the first phase, the questions
   being addressed by the broader research community included: Can HIV risk
   behaviors be purposefully impacted by behavioral interventions? If so,
   how do successful interventions differ from those that are not
   effective? Are theory-based interventions more likely to be effective
   than information-onlybased interventions? Can theories be translated
   into culturally and developmentally appropriate interventions including
   those that are appropriate for children and adolescents? Should parents
   be involved -and if so, how? During its next phase, the FOY team
   increasingly became concerned with a disturbing reality. A large number
   of interventions had been developed and some had been shown to have
   evidence of impact. But virtually all of these interventions had been
   conducted in the USA or Europe. The questions facing researchers
   included: With the global burden of HIV disproportionately impacting
   low-and middle-income countries (LMIC), especially those in southern
   Africa, the Caribbean and parts of Asia, what is known about the
   effectiveness of western-based interventions in these culturally,
   racially and economically disparate settings? With the exciting
   proliferation of interventions, federal agencies in the USA and
   international agencies including Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/
   AIDS realized the importance of assessing the research portfolio and
   developing metrics of effectiveness. The questions during this phase
   included: What is an ``effective{''} intervention? How are effective
   interventions implemented in a new setting? This phase merged with the
   next phase as researchers and public health workers realized that the
   dissemination to a new community of an intervention developed and found
   to be effective in one community requires change. The central questions
   during this time included: What changes or kinds of changes can be made
   to an intervention without undermining its effectiveness? What aspects
   of an intervention cannot be changed without potentially undermining its
   effectiveness? What constitutes a `` change{''}? Who should be involved
   in this decision-making? These efforts culminated in our current phase,
   one focused on implementation. We must learn more about the factors that
   allow an intervention to survive and thrive and selectively target these
   critical factors. The main objective of this paper is to review our
   experiences and lessons learned in developing, implementing and
   evaluating FOY in a wide range of socio-cultural settings over the past
   quarter of century.},
