Abstract = {Although Life Skills programs showed to improve the psychological and
   physical wellbeing of individuals, little attention has been paid,
   worldwide and in the Arab countries in specific to implementing life
   skills intervention for university students. In this study, we tested
   the effectiveness of a life skills based health promotion intervention
   KHOTWA (STEP) in enhancing the wellbeing of university students in
   Lebanon, a country that faces economic and political instability. This
   is a quasi-experimental study, with pre and post-test,
   intervention-control design. Each group was formed of 78 participants
   studying in a private university in Lebanon. Mixed design was used to
   address the process and outcomes objectives of the intervention. The
   program was carried online due to COVID-19 pandemic. Significant
   differences were observed between the intervention and the control
   groups for life skills, dietary habits and mental health scores at the
   3-month follow-up. For the intervention group, a significant increase
   was observed in the mean score of each of the following Life Skills
   subscales: self-care (p=0.001), work and study (p=0.013), career and
   education planning (p=0.011) and looking forward/goal settings
   (p<0.001). Students also achieved a healthier eating habit compared to
   those in the control group by decreasing their consumption of processed
   food. There was no significant effect in terms of body mass index
   (p=0.827). Also, there was a significant change in the mental health
   status (p=0.012) only in the intervention group as its mean score
   decreased after 3months of the intervention implementation. This
   intervention enhances the mental health and promotes healthy habits
   leading consequently to a better quality of life and more productivity
   amongst university students. Therefore, such interventions should be
   replicated in other similar context to improve university students'
   well-being.},

Abstract = {Most of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy targeted restoration
   and few have targeted primary prevention. The purpose of this study is
   to obtain the knowledge for further development on preventive mental
   healthcare application. We developed a personal mental healthcare
   application which aimed to give users the chance to manage their mental
   health by self-monitoring and regulating their behavior. Through the
   30-day field trial, the results showed improvement of mood score through
   conducting of suggested action, and the depressive mood of the
   participants was significantly decreased after the trial. The
   possibility of application and further problem was confirmed.},
