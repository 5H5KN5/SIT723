Abstract = {BackgroundStudent-athletes are one subgroup of college students in the
   USA at risk for dating violence and sexual risk behaviors. Despite this,
   research on student-athletes' dating behaviors is limited; existing
   research pertains primarily to the National Collegiate Athletic
   Association (NCAA) Division I athletes and focuses on male
   student-athletes as perpetrators of dating and sexual violence. While
   some existing programs aim to reduce dating violence and promote healthy
   relationships, these programs are education based, and not tailored to
   the specific strengths and challenges of student-athletes. We therefore
   designed Supporting Prevention in Relationships for Teams (SPoRT), a
   novel, four-session prevention intervention for Division III
   student-athletes of all genders to reduce dating violence and sexual
   risk behavior by targeting knowledge and skills identified in pilot
   research, incorporating psychoeducation with techniques from
   cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, bystander intervention, and
   normative feedback.MethodsThis study represents stage 1 of the National
   Institutes of Health (NIH) Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention
   Development, evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of SPoRT. We
   describe the development, content, and proposed delivery methods for
   SPoRT and evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of the program
   using a mixed-methods approach. Thirty college student-athletes (12 men,
   18 women) completed questionnaires and participated in focus groups to
   provide feedback on the program's length, timing, group size and
   dynamics, content, and suggestions for making the SPoRT prevention
   intervention more feasible and acceptable.ResultsOur recruitment
   procedures were successful, and participants rated the program as
   feasible in terms of delivery methods and logistics. Participants liked
   that SPoRT was developed based on pilot data collected from
   student-athletes, brief, and skills based and tailored to athletic team
   needs. SPoRT was perceived as appropriate and relevant to
   student-athlete needs in terms of dating violence and sexual risk
   prevention knowledge and skills. Most participants (63\%) rated the
   program as ``excellent{''} and said they would recommend it to
   others.ConclusionsWe found SPoRT to be both feasible and acceptable in
   terms of content and delivery. Suggested modifications will be
   incorporated into the SPoRT healthy relationships prevention
   intervention to be tested in an NIH Stage 1 efficacy trial.},

Abstract = {BackgroundNon-memory-led dementias such as posterior cortical atrophy
   (PCA), primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and behavioural variant
   frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are low prevalent and often affect
   individuals under the age of 65. Tailored educational and support
   resources for caregivers of people living with these dementia phenotypes
   are scarce and unevenly distributed geographically. Web-based
   educational programmes are emerging as promising alternatives to improve
   caregiver self-efficacy and well-being. Here, we present the protocol of
   a study aiming to assess the feasibility of a co-produced online
   educational programme for caregivers of people living PCA, PPA and
   bvFTD: the Better Living with Non-memory-led Dementia programme.MethodsA
   randomised controlled feasibility trial will be conducted on a sample of
   30 caregivers of people living with PCA, PPA and bvFTD. Participants
   will be recruited among members of the support organisation Rare
   Dementia Support (based at UCL in the UK). The intervention group will
   be given access to an 8-week co-produced web-based educational programme
   consisting of 6 modules addressing education about PCA, PPA and bvFTD
   and support strategies for the person with dementia and for the
   caregiver. The control group will receive treatment as usual (TAU).
   Feasibility will be measured through feasibility of recruitment,
   clinical measurement tools and acceptability. Clinical measures will be
   used to assess preliminary efficacy and data on completion rates,
   missing data and variability used to decide on measures to be included
   in a full-scale trial.Allocation ratio will be 2:1
   (intervention:control) stratified by diagnosis. Feasibility of
   recruitment and acceptability will be assessed. Clinical measures will
   be administered at baseline and 8-week and 3-month post-randomisation.
   The control group will be offered access to the intervention at the
   completion of data collection. Participants will be unblinded, and all
   measures will be self-reported online.MethodsA randomised controlled

Abstract = {BackgroundObesity is a chronic disease and is an established risk factor
   for other chronic diseases and mortality. Young adulthood is a period
   when people may be highly amenable to healthy behavior change, develop
   lifelong healthy behaviors, and when primary prevention of obesity may
   be feasible. Interventions in early adulthood have the potential for
   primary or primordial prevention (i.e., preventing risk factors before
   disease onset). The primary objective of this study is to determine the
   feasibility of a 6-month behavioral and educational intervention to
   promote healthy behaviors for obesity prevention among young
   adults.MethodsThis is the study protocol for a pilot randomized
   controlled trial. Young adults (age 18-29) attending McMaster
   University, Hamilton, Canada, will be recruited and randomized to either
   the intervention or control. The intervention will include individual
   motivational interviewing sessions (online or in-person) with a trained
   interviewer plus educational materials (based on Canada's food guide and
   physical activity recommendations). The control group will receive
   educational materials only. The primary feasibility outcomes that will
   be evaluated as part of this pilot study include enrollment, retention
   (\& GE; 80\%), data completion (\& GE; 80\% of weights measured, and
   surveys completed), and participant satisfaction. Secondary clinical
   outcomes will include body mass index (BMI) change from baseline to 6
   months, physical activity, nutrition risk, health-related quality of
   life mental health, and economic outcomes. Outcomes will be measured
   remotely using activity trackers, and online questionnaires at baseline
   and every 2 months. Risk stratification will be applied at baseline to
   identify participants at high risk of obesity (e.g., due to family or
   personal history). Exit questionnaires will collect data on how
   participants felt about the study and cost analysis will be
   conducted.DiscussionOur pilot randomized controlled trial will evaluate
   the feasibility of an obesity prevention intervention in early adulthood
   and will inform future larger studies for obesity prevention. The
   results of this study have the potential to directly contribute to the
   primary prevention of several types of cancer by testing an intervention
   that could be scalable to public health, post-secondary education, or
   primary care settings.Trial

Abstract = {BackgroundStress levels and thus the risk of developing related physical
   and mental health conditions are rising worldwide. Dysfunctional beliefs
   contribute to the development of stress. Potentially, such beliefs can
   be modified with approach-avoidance modification trainings (AAMT). As
   previous research indicates that effects of AAMTs are small, there is a
   need for innovative ways of increasing the efficacy of these
   interventions. For this purpose, we aim to evaluate the feasibility of
   the intervention and study design and explore the efficacy of an
   innovative emotion-based AAMT version (eAAMT) that uses the display of
   emotions to move stress-inducing beliefs away from and draw
   stress-reducing beliefs towards oneself.MethodsWe will conduct a
   parallel randomized controlled pilot study at the
   Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany. Individuals
   with elevated stress levels will be randomized to one of eight study
   conditions (n = 10 per condition) - one of six variants of the eAAMT, an
   active control intervention (swipe-based AAMT), or an inactive control
   condition. Participants in the intervention groups will engage in four
   sessions of 20-30 min (e)AAMT training on consecutive days. Participants
   in the inactive control condition will complete the assessments via an
   online tool. Non-blinded assessments will be taken directly before and
   after the training and 1 week after training completion. The primary
   outcome will be perceived stress. Secondary outcomes will be
   dysfunctional beliefs, symptoms of depression, emotion regulation
   skills, and physiological stress measures. We will compute effect sizes
   and conduct mixed ANOVAs to explore differences in change in outcomes
   between the eAAMT and control conditions.DiscussionThe study will
   provide valuable information to improve the intervention and study
   design. Moreover, if shown to be effective, the approach can be used as
   an automated smartphone-based intervention. Future research needs to
   identify target groups benefitting from this intervention utilized
   either as stand-alone treatment or an add-on intervention that is
   combined with other evidence-based treatments.Trial registrationThe
   trial has been registered in the German Clinical Trials Register

Title = {Growing Healthy Hearts: a single-arm feasibility study of a digitally

   risk factors for cardiovascular disease},

Abstract = {Background Food gardening may positively influence cardiovascular
   disease (CVD) risk-related behaviors. However, the vast majority of
   existing gardening interventions have used an in-person delivery model
   which has limitations for scalability. It is not known whether a
   digitally delivered gardening intervention would be feasible or
   acceptable to participants. The purpose of this pilot study was to
   assess the feasibility of a digitally delivered gardening intervention
   in three domains: participant acceptability, demand, and practicality.
   Methods A single-arm, pre-post-study design was used. Participants (n =
   30) were aged 20 + with no plans to garden in the coming season and had
   at least 1 CVD risk factor. The intervention included ten 1-h
   video-conferencing sessions, written materials, and access to a study
   website. Content focused on gardening skills, cooking skills, and the
   Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Feasibility
   outcomes included acceptability (postprogram ratings), demand (session
   attendance rate), and practicality (ability to start a garden and grow
   F\&V). The study was considered feasible if the following criteria were
   met: = 70\% rated the intervention as good or excellent, overall session
   attendance rate was = 70\%, and > 70\% were able to start a garden and
   grow F\&V. We also assessed prepost-program changes in behavioral
   mediators (gardening confidence, gardening enjoyment, cooking
   confidence, and nutrition knowledge). Descriptive statistics were
   calculated. Pre-post differences were evaluated with means and 95\%
   confidence intervals (95\% CI). Effect sizes were calculated (Cohen's
   d).
   Results All feasibility criteria were met. A total of 93.3\% of
   participants rated the intervention as good or excellent, 96\% started a
   garden and grew F\&V, and the overall session attendance rate was 81\%.
   The largest mean pre-post changes were in gardening confidence (pre 7.1
   {[}95\% CI: 6.4, 7.9], post 9.0 {[}95\% CI: 8.6, 9.5], Cohen's d =
   1.15), gardening enjoyment (pre: 6.3 {[}95\% CI: 5.9, 6.7], post: 7.5
   {[}95\% CI: 7.1, 7.9], Cohen's d = 1.69), and cooking self-efficacy
   (pre: 4.7 {[}95\% CI: 4.3, 5.1], post: 7.7 {[}95\% CI: 7.3, 8.0],
   Cohen's d = 3.0).
   Conclusion A digitally delivered gardening intervention was feasible,
   acceptable to participants, and they had meaningful changes in
   behavioral mediators. The next step is to evaluate the impact of the
   intervention in a future randomized controlled trial.},

Abstract = {Background Teacher-delivered behavioral classroom management
   interventions are effective for students with or at-risk for
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other disruptive
   behavior challenges, but they can be difficult for teachers to use in
   the classroom. In this study, we will pilot test a package of
   implementation strategies to support teachers in using behavioral
   classroom interventions for students with ADHD symptoms.
   Methods We will use a 2-group, randomized controlled trial to compare
   outcomes for teachers who receive Positive Behavior Management
   Implementation Resources (PBMIR), a theory and data-driven
   implementation resource package designed to increase teacher
   implementation of behavioral classroom management interventions, with
   those who do not receive this additional implementation support. We will
   measure teacher implementation outcomes (e.g., observed fidelity to
   behavioral classroom interventions) and student clinical outcomes (e.g.,
   ADHD-related impairment, ADHD symptoms, student-teacher relationship,
   academic performance) before and after an 8-week intervention period for
   both groups; we will also measure teacher-reported acceptability,
   appropriateness, and feasibility for the PBMIR group following the
   intervention period.
   Discussion If there is preliminary evidence of feasibility and
   effectiveness, this pilot study will provide the foundation for
   evaluation the PBMIR at a larger scale and the potential to improve
   outcomes for students with or at risk for ADHD.},

Title = {Development and testing the feasibility of a sports-based mental health

Abstract = {BackgroundMental wellbeing encompasses life satisfaction, social
   connectedness, agency and resilience. In adolescence, mental wellbeing
   reduces sexual health risk behaviours, substance use and violence;
   improves educational outcomes; and protects mental health in adulthood.
   Mental health promotion seeks to improve mental wellbeing and can
   include activities to engage participants in sport. However, few
   high-quality trials of mental health promotion interventions have been
   conducted with adolescents, especially in low- and middle-income
   countries. We sought to address this gap by testing SMART (Sports-based
   Mental heAlth pRomotion for adolescenTs) in a pilot cluster-randomised
   controlled trial (cRCT) in Bardiya, Nepal.MethodsThe objectives of the
   trial are to assess the acceptability and feasibility of SMART, test
   trial procedures, explore outcome distributions in intervention and
   control clusters and calculate the total annual cost of the intervention
   and unit cost per adolescent. The trial design is a parallel-group,
   two-arm superiority pilot cRCT with a 1:1 allocation ratio and two
   cross-sectional census surveys with adolescents aged 12-19, one
   pre-intervention (baseline) and one post-intervention (endline). The
   study area is four communities of approximately 1000 population (166
   adolescents per community). Each community represents one cluster. SMART
   comprises twice weekly football, martial arts and dance coaching, open
   to all adolescents in the community, led by local sports coaches who
   have received psychosocial training. Sports melas (festivals) and
   theatre performances will raise community awareness about SMART, mental
   health and the benefits of sport. Adolescents in control clusters will
   participate in sport as usual. In baseline and endline surveys, we will
   measure mental wellbeing, self-esteem, self-efficacy, emotion
   regulation, social support, depression, anxiety and functional
   impairment. Using observation checklists, unstructured observation and
   attendance registers from coaching sessions, and minutes of meetings
   between coaches and supervisors, we will assess intervention fidelity,
   exposure and reach. In focus group discussions and interviews with
   coaches, teachers, caregivers and adolescents, we will explore
   intervention acceptability and mechanisms of change. Intervention costs
   will be captured from monthly project accounts, timesheets and
   discussions with staff members.DiscussionFindings will identify elements
   of the intervention and trial procedures requiring revision prior to a
   full cRCT to evaluate the effectiveness of SMART.},

Abstract = {Background Social-emotional capacities contribute to children's mental
   health by helping them navigate their own and others' emotional states
   and forge healthy relationships. Caregivers and educators are critical
   socialization agents in early and middle childhood, but gaps remain in
   the systematic integration of social-emotional research into caregiver
   and educator trainings. The aim of this pilot study was to test the
   feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a social-emotional training
   designed to promote caregivers' and educators' capacities to support
   social-emotional development in children ages 3-8 years.Methods Fifty
   adults (n = 24 caregivers of children ages 3-8 years, n = 26 educators
   working with children ages 3-8 years) participated in a virtual training
   over 3 weeks. Participants completed pre-training, post-training, and
   2-month follow-up questionnaires evaluating their knowledge of
   social-emotional concepts, use of training strategies, mental health,
   and satisfaction with the training. Caregivers also reported children's
   social-emotional capacities and mental health.Results On average,
   caregivers and educators completed 83\% of the virtual training sessions
   and reported high satisfaction with the training. Further, preliminary
   evidence indicated that caregivers' and educators' knowledge of
   social-emotional concepts increased pre- to post-training and was
   maintained at the 2-month follow-up. Increases in caregivers' and
   educators' knowledge and greater use of training strategies were
   associated with improvements in children's social-emotional capacities
   and caregivers' and educators' own mental health.Conclusions These pilot
   results support the feasibility of infusing evidence-based
   social-emotional content into caregiver and educator training
   initiatives aimed at nurturing child social-emotional development and
   mental health. The results inform future evaluation of the short- and
   long-term benefits of this training with a full-scale randomized
   controlled trial design.},

Abstract = {BackgroundExcessive gestational weight gain (EGWG), insufficient
   prenatal physical activity and sleep, and poor psychological wellbeing
   independently increase risks for adverse maternal and infant outcomes. A
   novel approach to mitigate these risks is utilizing peer support in a
   community-based prenatal intervention. This study assessed the
   feasibility (acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality) of
   a remotely delivered prenatal physical activity intervention called My
   Baby, My Move + (MBMM +) that aims to increase prenatal physical
   activity, enhance mood and sleep hygiene, and reduce
   EGWG.MethodsParticipants were recruited through community organizations,
   local clinics, and social media platforms in the Fall of 2020 and Spring
   of 2021. Eligible pregnant women were randomized to either the MBMM +
   intervention or the control group. Each group met over Zoom for 16
   sessions (twice weekly for 60 min over 8 weeks) to learn either
   behavioral change and wellbeing knowledge and skills (MBMM +) or
   knowledge and skills related to parenting (control group). Multiple
   methods of evaluation to better understand the feasibility of the
   intervention were conducted.ResultsA total of 49 women (25 MBMM +
   intervention, 24 control) completed both pre- and post-survey
   assessments and were included in the analyses. A subsample of 19 (39\%)
   intervention participants completed a combination of semi-structured
   interviews/surveys to assess acceptability, demand, implementation, and
   practicality. Participants expressed positive feedback regarding
   acceptability (satisfaction and intent to continue use) and were
   extremely likely or likely to recommend the program to a friend
   (demand). Implementation metrics were assessed by observation and
   feedback forms completed by peer leaders and demonstrated high-quality
   control. Findings suggest that the intervention was practical due to
   remote sessions and cost-effectiveness.ConclusionThe MBMM + intervention
   was deemed to be a feasible intervention with high acceptability,
   demand, implementation, and practicality. These findings can be used to
   inform the scalability of the intervention and implementation of a
   larger efficacy trial.},

Title = {Improving reflective evaluations of sport through repeated experiences
   of fun-rationale, design, feasibility, and acceptability of the PlayFit
   Youth Sport Program},

Abstract = {IntroductionAdolescents who drop out of sport often report that it had
   become less `fun' and `enjoyable' over time. Although preadolescent
   sport typically emphasizes experiences of fun, emphases on competition
   and elite performance often dominate during adolescence. We theorized
   that adherence to adolescent sport might be improved if the overarching
   goal were to maximize repeated experiences of fun during sport and,
   subsequently, increase reflective evaluations of sport enjoyment. To
   that end, this manuscript reports on the rationale and design of the
   PlayFit Youth Sport Program (PYSP), as well as its preliminary
   feasibility and acceptability. The main objectives were to evaluate the
   feasibility of recruitment strategies and data collection procedures and
   the acceptability of the intervention.SettingAn outdoor, multipurpose
   grass field at a south-central Pennsylvania middle school.MethodsA
   mixed-methods, single-arm feasibility trial lasting for 8 weeks
   (August-October 2021) offered 3-times per week for 1-h per session. The
   equipment, ruleset, and psychosocial environment of the PYSP sport games
   were modified to reduce several of the constraints theorized to impair
   experiences of fun during sport and hamper reflective evaluations of
   enjoyment afterward. ResultsEleven healthy, but sedentary adolescents in
   grades 5-7 completed the program. The median number of sessions attended
   (of 16 possible) was 12 (range = 6-13). Post-intervention, 9/10
   respondents indicated that they `looked forward' to the PYSP, 8/10 would
   recommend it to a friend, and 8/10 were interested in continuing the
   program. Ten of 11 participant guardians expressed interest in
   reenrolling their children if the PYSP were offered again. Some changes
   recommended were to improve recruitment via advertising the positive
   aspects of the program and ``word of mouth{''} techniques, offering the
   program immediately following the school day, having contingencies for
   inclement weather, and minor changes to the sport equipment to improve
   the experience among the population the PYSP intends to
   attract.ConclusionsThe adjustments recommended in this preliminary work
   could be used to further refine the PYSP. A future efficacy trial could
   explore whether the PYSP may reduce attrition for adolescents who
   experience existing sport programs negatively by offering an alternative
   that better matches their unique needs and preferences.},

Title = {Accelerating the development of a psychological intervention to restore
   treatment decision-making capacity in patients with
   schizophrenia-spectrum disorder: a study protocol for a multi-site,
   assessor-blinded, pilot Umbrella trial (the DEC:IDES trial)},

Abstract = {Background A high proportion of patients diagnosed with
   schizophrenia-spectrum disorders will at some point in their lives be
   assessed as not having the capacity to make their own decisions about
   pharmacological treatment or inpatient care ('capacity'). Few will be
   helped to regain it before these interventions proceed. This is partly
   because effective and safe methods to do so are lacking. Our aim is to
   accelerate their development by testing, for the first time in mental
   healthcare, the feasibility, acceptability and safety of running an
   `Umbrella' trial. This involves running, concurrently and under one
   multi-site infrastructure, multiple assessor-blind randomised controlled
   trials, each of which is designed to examine the effect on capacity of
   improving a single psychological mechanism ('mechanism'). Our primary
   objectives are to demonstrate feasibility of (i) recruitment and (ii)
   data retention on the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Treatment
   (MacCAT-T; planned primary outcome for a future trial) at
   end-of-treatment. We selected three mechanisms to test: `self-stigma',
   low self-esteem and the `jumping to conclusions' bias. Each is highly
   prevalent in psychosis, responsive to psychological intervention, and
   hypothesised to contribute to impaired capacity.
   Methods Sixty participants with schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses,
   impaired capacity and one or more mechanism(s) will be recruited from
   outpatient and inpatient mental health services in three UK sites
   (Lothian, Scotland; Lancashire and Pennine; North West England). Those
   lacking capacity to consent to research could take part if the key
   criteria were met, including either proxy consent (Scotland) or
   favourable Consultee advice (England). They will be allocated to one of
   three randomised controlled trials, depending on which mechanism(s) they
   have. They will then be randomised to receive, over an 8-week period and
   in addition to treatment as usual (TAU), 6 sessions of either a
   psychological intervention which targets the mechanism, or 6 sessions of
   assessment of the causes of their incapacity (control condition).
   Participants are assessed at 0 (baseline), 8 (end-of-treatment) and 24
   (follow-up) weeks post-randomisation using measures of capacity
   (MacCAT-T), mechanism, adverse events, psychotic symptoms, subjective
   recovery, quality of life, service use, anxiety, core schemata and
   depression. Two nested qualitative studies will be conducted; one to
   understand participant and clinician experiences and one to investigate
   the validity of MacCAT-T appreciation ratings.
   Discussion This will be the first Umbrella trial in mental healthcare.
   It will produce the first 3 single-blind randomised controlled trials of
   psychological interventions to support treatment decision-making in
   schizophrenia-spectrum disorder. Demonstrating feasibility will have
   significant implications not only for those seeking to support capacity
   in psychosis, but also for those who wish to accelerate the development
   of psychological interventions for other conditions.},

Abstract = {BackgroundIn Ireland, the agriculture sector reports the highest number
   of fatalities even though farmers constitute only 6\% of the working
   population. Tractor-related behaviours are implicated in 55\% of all
   vehicle work-related fatalities and 25\% of reported injuries, and many
   of these occur in farmyards. There is limited research on the
   feasibility and acceptability of behaviour change interventions to
   improve tractor safety. Target behaviours that promote safe operation in
   farmyards, determining and addressing blind spots of tractors, were
   identified, and an intervention was developed following the Behaviour
   Change Wheel Approach. The objective of the study is to examine the
   feasibility, fidelity and acceptability of a behaviour change
   intervention to enhance the safe operation of tractors in farmyards with
   a particular focus on tractor blind spots.MethodA single group
   feasibility study will be undertaken. Approximately 16 farmers from four
   major farm types will be recruited for the study between August and
   September 2022. The intervention involves an in-person demo session,
   facilitated discussion and personalised safety training procedure with
   safety goals. The study will collect data from participants at three
   time points: baseline (3-10 days prior to the intervention), during the
   intervention and at the follow-up session (7-30 days post-intervention).
   Quantitative data will be collected through a pre-intervention interview
   and feedback surveys. A pre- and post-intervention qualitative interview
   will also be conducted with the participants and will be supplemented
   with qualitative data from recruitment logs, observational memos and
   logs and feedback from recruiters. Evaluation of the feasibility,
   acceptability and fidelity of the intervention will be guided by a
   pre-determined feasibility checklist, fidelity framework and theoretical
   framework of acceptability, respectively. Interviews will be analysed
   using the content analysis.DiscussionThe current study can determine the
   feasibility and fidelity of delivering a systematic, theoretically
   driven, tailored behaviour change intervention. It will also assess
   whether the intervention, its ingredients and delivery are acceptable to
   the farming population. This study will also inform the development of a
   future larger trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention.},

Abstract = {BackgroundEarly language difficulties are associated with poor school
   readiness and can impact lifelong attainment. The quality of the early
   home language environment is linked to language outcomes. However, few
   home-based language interventions have sufficient evidence of
   effectiveness in improving preschool children's language abilities. This
   study reports the first stage in the evaluation of a theory-based
   programme, Talking Together (developed and delivered by BHT Early
   Education and Training) given over 6 weeks to families in the home
   setting. We aimed to test the feasibility and acceptability of
   delivering Talking Together in the Better Start Bradford community prior
   to a definitive trial, using a two-armed randomised controlled
   feasibility study.MethodsFamilies from a single site within the Better
   Start Bradford reach area were randomly allocated (1:1) to the Talking
   Together intervention or a wait list control group. Child language and
   parent-level outcome measures were administered before randomisation
   (baseline), pre-intervention (pre-test), 2 months post-intervention
   start (post-test), and 6 months post-intervention start (follow-up).
   Routine monitoring data from families and practitioners were also
   collected for eligibility, consent, protocol adherence, and attrition
   rates. Descriptive statistics on the feasibility and reliability of
   potential outcome measures were analysed alongside qualitative feedback
   on trial design acceptability. Pre-defined progression-to-trial criteria
   using a traffic light system were assessed using routine monitoring
   data.ResultsTwo-hundred and twenty-two families were assessed for
   eligibility; of these, 164 were eligible. A total of 102 families
   consented and were randomised (intervention: 52, waitlist control: 50);
   68\% of families completed outcome measures at 6-month follow-up.
   Recruitment (eligibility and consent) reached `green' progression
   criteria; however, adherence reached `amber' and attrition reached `red'
   criteria. Child- and parent-level data were successfully measured, and
   the Oxford-CDI was identified as a suitable primary outcome measure for
   a definitive trial. Qualitative data not only indicated that the
   procedures were largely acceptable to practitioners and families but
   also identified areas for improvement in adherence and attrition
   rates.ConclusionsReferral rates indicate that Talking Together is a
   much-needed service and was positively received by the community. A full
   trial is feasible with adaptations to improve adherence and reduce
   attrition.},

Title = {Keeping Active with Texting after Stroke (KATS): development of a text

Abstract = {BackgroundPost-stroke physical activity reduces disability and risk of
   further stroke. When stroke rehabilitation ends, some people feel
   abandoned by services and struggle to undertake physical activities that
   support recovery and health. The aim of this study was to codesign a
   novel text message intervention to promote physical activity among
   people with stroke and provide support when formal rehabilitation ends.
   This manuscript describes the intervention development processes that
   will inform future pilot and feasibility studies.MethodsThe planned
   intervention was a series of text messages to be sent in a predetermined
   sequence to people with stroke at the end of rehabilitation. The
   intervention, underpinned by behaviour change theory and using salient
   behaviour change techniques, would provide daily messages offering
   encouragement and support for the uptake and maintenance of physical
   activity following stroke. The intervention was codesigned by a
   Collaborative Working Group, comprised of people with stroke,
   rehabilitation therapists, representatives from stroke charities and
   academics. A four-step framework was used to design the intervention:
   formative research on physical activity post-stroke, creation of the
   behaviour change text message intervention, pre-testing and refinement.
   Formative research included a review of the scientific evidence and
   interviews with community-dwelling people with stroke. Data generated
   were used by the Collaborative Working Group to identify topics to be
   addressed in the intervention. These were mapped to constructs of the
   Health Action Process Approach, and salient behaviour change techniques
   to deliver the intervention were identified. The intervention was
   rendered into a series of text messages to be delivered over 12 weeks.
   The draft intervention was revised and refined through an iterative
   process including review by people with stroke, their spouses,
   rehabilitation therapists and experts in the field of stroke.The
   messages encourage regular physical activity but do not prescribe
   exercise or provide reminders to exercise at specific times. They use
   conversational language to encourage engagement, and some are
   personalised for participants. Quotes from people with stroke provide
   encouragement and support and model key behaviour change techniques such
   as goal setting and coping planning.DiscussionCo-design processes were
   critical in systematically developing this theory and evidence-based
   intervention. People with stroke and rehabilitation therapists provided
   insights into perceived barriers post-rehabilitation and identified
   strategies to overcome them. The structured multistep approach
   highlighted areas for improvement through successive rounds of review.
   The intervention will be tested for acceptability, feasibility and
   effectiveness in future studies. This co-design approach could be used
   for interventions for other heath behaviours and with different
   populations.},

Abstract = {BackgroundEvasive personality disorder (AvPD) and social phobia (SP)
   have substantial costs for patients and their families and great
   economic costs to the society. While psychotherapy can be an efficacious
   treatment, many patients drop out during treatment. Increased knowledge
   on how to decrease dropout from psychotherapy is warranted, including
   how to increase a patient's readiness for psychotherapy.MethodsWe
   describe a randomized controlled feasibility and superiority trial of 42
   individuals with a clinical diagnosis of either SP or AvPD, who are to
   initiate psychotherapeutic treatment in Danish outpatient mental health
   services. They will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either
   assessment-as-usual and receive no further assessment or to a Modified
   Collaborative Assessment (MCA) provided as a pre-treatment intervention
   before psychotherapy initiation. MCA will include a battery of
   psychological tests designed to thoroughly assess the patients'
   psychopathology. The tests are administered in collaboration with the
   patient, including detailed oral and written feedback. We hypothesize
   that the intervention is feasible regarding patient's acceptance and
   adherence. We further hypothesize that patients randomized to MCA will
   reach higher levels of readiness for psychotherapy as assessed with the
   University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale
   (URICA).DiscussionThis protocol assesses the feasibility, efficacy,
   acceptability, and safety of an intervention aimed at changing the
   readiness for participation in psychotherapy of patients with SP and
   AvPD. Results from this feasibility study could guide the development of
   future large-scale trials of MCA and procedures for MCA treatment
   fidelity assessment.},

Title = {Systematic braiding of Smoke-Free Home SafeCare to address child
   maltreatment risk and secondhand smoke exposure: findings from a pilot

Abstract = {Background Exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) and child
   maltreatment are preventable threats to child health. Few evidence-based
   interventions target both SHS and child maltreatment risk. The purpose
   of this paper is to describe the systematic braiding process of two
   evidence-based programs to address child SHS in the home and
   maltreatment perpetration risk, and present results from the formative
   work and pilot study.
   Methods The first 4 steps of the systematic braiding process were
   completed, including the following: (1) the identification of core
   elements of both programs, (2) the development of an initial draft of
   the braided curriculum (Smoke-Free Home SafeCare - SFH-SC), (3) an
   acceptability and feasibility pilot of SFH-SC with caregivers of young
   children who reported a smoker living in the home (N = 8), and (4)
   feedback collection on the braided curriculum from SafeCare Providers (N
   = 9).
   Results Experts identified common pedagogical and theoretical
   underpinnings for the two programs and braided Smoke-Free Homes: Some
   Things Are Better Outside into two SafeCare modules. Caregiver feedback
   from the pilot demonstrated that participants were engaged with SFH-SC
   and felt supported and comfortable discussing SHS intervention content
   with the SFH-SC Provider. Caregiver self-reports indicated a slight
   increase in smoke-free home rules from baseline to follow-up and a
   notable reduction in parent stress on the Parent Stress Index of 5.9
   points (SD = 10.2). SafeCare Provider feedback following intensive
   review of the curriculum indicated high feasibility for SFH-SC delivery.
   Conclusions Parent and Provider findings suggest SFH-SC is a viable
   intervention that has potential to reduce the public health impact of
   SHS and child maltreatment for at-risk families.},

   (symptom duration > 1 year) were recruited from community mental health
   services and computer randomised to 42 sessions of group music therapy
   with songwriting three times per week or wait-list control. Depression,
   social functioning, distress, quality of life, satisfaction and service
   use were assessed by blinded researchers at enrolment, 1 week and 3 and
   6 months post-therapy. Outcomes were analysed descriptively, controlling
   for baseline covariates. Recruitment (number eligible, participation and
   retention rates) and intervention (fidelity, adherence) feasibility were
   assessed using pre-defined stop-go criteria. Attendance, adverse events,
   mood, relationship satisfaction and semi-structured interviews were
   analysed in a nested process evaluation.ResultsRecruitment processes
   were feasible with 421 eligible, 12.7\% participation and 60\% (18/30)
   retention. Thirty participants were randomised to intervention (N = 20)
   and control (N = 10). Session attendance was low (mean 10.5) with four
   withdrawals. Music therapist adherence was good but changes to session
   frequency were suggested. Outcomes were available for 10/20 treatment
   and 9/10 wait-list participants. Depression increased in both arms
   post-therapy. Treatment depression scores fell below baseline 3 and 6
   months post-therapy indicating improvement. Wait-list depression scores
   increased from baseline 3 and 6 months post-therapy. At 3 months, the
   treatment arm improved from baseline on all measures except satisfaction
   and functioning. At 6 months, quality of life, distress and functioning
   improved with reduction in health service contacts. High-attending
   participants improved more than low-attending. Seven adverse events (one
   serious) were reported.LimitationsAs this was a feasibility study,
   clinical outcomes should be interpreted cautiously.ConclusionA
   randomised controlled trial of group music therapy using songwriting is
   feasible with inclusion criteria and session frequency modifications,
   but further intervention development is required.},

Title = {Evaluating an emotion coaching programme for parents of young

Abstract = {BackgroundEarly adolescence is a time of increased vulnerability for the
   development of common mental health conditions such as anxiety and
   depression (internalising outcomes). Current treatments such as
   cognitive-behavioural therapy and antidepressant medication are focused
   on the individual and have small effect sizes, particularly in
   real-world clinical settings such as the public Child Adolescent Mental
   Health Services (CAMHS). Parents are an important and under-utilised
   resource in treating these conditions in young adolescents. Teaching
   parents how to respond to their young person's emotions can improve
   emotion regulation and reduce internalising outcomes. One
   emotion-focused programme for parents of this age group is Tuning in to
   Teens (TINT). This is a structured, manualised skills group for parents
   only focused on teaching skills to coach young people through their
   emotional experiences. This study aims to investigate the impact of TINT
   in the clinical setting of publicly funded CAMHS in New
   Zealand.MethodsThe trial will evaluate the feasibility of a two-arm
   multi-site randomised control trial (RCT). Participants will be
   10-14-year-olds referred to CAMHS in Wellington, New Zealand, with
   anxiety or depression, and their parents or guardians. Arm 1 will be
   parents attending and implementing TINT (in addition to the usual care
   received at CAMHS). Arm 2 will be usual care only. TINT groups will be
   facilitated by CAMHS clinicians who have been trained in the programme
   and will be delivered over 8 weekly sessions. Prior to the RCT, a
   co-design methodology will be used with service users to inform outcome
   measures used in the trial. A group of service users meeting the RCT
   criteria will be recruited to take part in workshops to help determine
   their priority outcomes. Measures based on the results of workshops will
   be included in the outcome measures. The primary feasibility outcomes
   will be the recruitment and retention of participants, acceptability of
   the intervention for service users and clinicians and acceptability of
   outcome measures.DiscussionThere is a need to improve outcomes for the
   treatment of adolescent anxiety and depression. TINT is a programme with
   the potential to enhance outcomes for those accessing mental health
   services by providing targeted support to parents of adolescents. This
   trial will inform whether a full RCT is feasible to evaluate TINT.
   Including service users in the design will increase its relevance of an
   evaluation in this setting.},

Abstract = {Background The use of psychoactive substances significantly impacts the
   health, social and economic aspects of families, communities and
   nations. There is a need to develop and test psychological interventions
   aimed for individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) in lower- and
   middle-income countries (LMICs), such as in Pakistan. The aim of this
   exploratory trial is to test the feasibility and acceptability of two
   culturally adapted psychological interventions in a factorial randomised
   controlled trial (RCT).Methods The proposed project will be conducted in
   three phases. The first phase of the study will focus on cultural
   adaptation of the interventions through qualitative interviews with key
   stakeholders. The second phase will be to refine and produce manually
   assisted interventions. Third and last stage would be to assess the
   feasibility of the culturally adapted interventions through a factorial
   RCT. The study will be carried out in Karachi, Hyderabad, Peshawar,
   Lahore and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Recruitment of participants will take
   place from primary care and volunteer organisations/drug rehabilitation
   centres. A total of 260 individuals diagnosed with SUD (n = 65) in each
   of the four arms will be recruited. The intervention will be delivered
   weekly over a period of 12 weeks in both individual and group settings.
   Assessments will be carried out at baseline, at 12th week (after
   completion of intervention) and 24th week post-randomisation. The
   analysis will determine the feasibility of recruitment, randomisation,
   retention and intervention delivery. Acceptability of intervention will
   be determined in terms of adherence to intervention, i.e. the mean
   number of sessions attended, number of home assignments completed,
   attrition rates, as well as through process evaluation to understand the
   implementation process, context, participants' satisfaction, and impact
   of the study intervention. The health resource use and impact on the
   quality of life will be established through health economic
   data.Discussion This study will provide evidence for feasibility and
   acceptability of culturally adapted manually assisted psychological
   interventions for individuals with SUD in the context of Pakistan. The
   study will have clinical implications if intervention is proven feasible
   and acceptable.},

Abstract = {BackgroundMental illnesses comprise the single largest source of
   health-related economic burden globally, and low- and middle-income
   countries are disproportionately affected. The majority of people with
   schizophrenia who need treatment do not receive it and are often wholly
   reliant on family caregivers for daily care and support. Family
   interventions have an exceptionally robust evidence base for their
   efficacy in high-resource settings, but it is unknown whether they can
   produce equivalent effects in some low-resource settings where cultural
   beliefs, explanatory models of illness and contextual socio-economic
   issues differ.MethodsThis protocol describes the methods for a
   randomised controlled trial to determine the feasibility of testing
   culturally adapt and refine an evidence-based, family intervention for
   relatives and caregivers of people with schizophrenia in Indonesia. The
   feasibility and acceptability of implementing our adapted, co-produced
   intervention via task shifting in primary care settings will be
   evaluated using the Medical Research Council framework for complex
   interventions. We will recruit 60 carer-service-user dyads and randomise
   them in a 1:1 ratio either to receive our manualised intervention or
   continue to receive treatment as usual. Healthcare workers in primary
   care settings will be trained to deliver family interventions using our
   manualised intervention by a family intervention specialist.
   Participants will complete the ECI, IEQ, KAST and GHQ. Service-user
   symptom level and relapse status will be measured using the PANSS at
   baseline, post-intervention and 3 months later by trained researchers.
   Fidelity to the intervention model will be measured using the FIPAS.
   Qualitative evaluation will further assist with refining the
   intervention, evaluating trial processes and evaluating
   acceptability.DiscussionNational healthcare policy in Indonesia supports
   the delivery of mental health services in a complex network of primary
   care centres. This study will provide important information on the
   feasibility of delivering family interventions for people with
   schizophrenia via task shifting in primary care settings in Indonesia
   and allow further refinement of the intervention and trial processes.},

Abstract = {Background People with intellectual disabilities (ID) experience high
   rates of lifestyle related morbidities, in part due to lack of access to
   tailored health promotion programmes. This study aimed to assess the
   feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a tailored healthy lifestyle
   intervention, Get Healthy! Methods Get Healthy! is a 12-week physical
   activity and healthy eating programme designed to address
   lifestyle-related risks for adults with mild-moderate ID. The
   feasibility pilot was designed to assess subjective participant
   experience and programme feasibility across: recruitment and screening,
   retention, session attendance and engagement, adverse events, and
   practicality and reliability of outcome procedures. Exploratory
   programme efficacy was assessed across the following measures:
   anthropometry (body mass index, weight, waist circumference),
   cardiovascular fitness, physical strength, dietary intake, healthy
   literacy, and quality of life.
   Results Six participants with moderate ID and two carer participants
   completed the feasibility trial, representing a 100\% retention rate.
   Qualitative data indicated the programme was well received. Participants
   with ID attended 75\% of sessions offered and displayed a high level of
   engagement in sessions attended (91\% mean engagement score). While most
   data collection procedures were feasible to implement, several measures
   were either not feasible for our participants, or required a higher
   level of support to implement than was provided in the existing trial
   protocol. Participants with ID displayed decreases in mean waist
   circumference between baseline and endpoint (95\% CI: - 3.20, - 0.17 cm)
   and some improvements in measures of cardiovascular fitness and physical
   strength. No changes in weight, body mass index, or objectively measured
   knowledge of nutrition and exercise or quality of life were detected
   from baseline to programme endpoint. Dietary intake results were mixed.
   Discussion The Get Healthy! programme was feasible to implement and well
   received by participants with moderate ID and their carers. Exploratory
   efficacy data indicates the programme has potential to positively impact
   important cardiometabolic risk factors such as waist circumference,
   cardiovascular fitness, and physical strength. Several of the proposed
   data collection instruments will require modification or replacement
   prior to use in a sufficiently powered efficacy trial.},

Abstract = {Background Many people do not regularly participate in physical
   activity, which may negatively impact their health. Current physical
   activity guidelines are focused on promoting weekly accumulation of at
   least 150 min of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity
   (MVPA). Whilst revised guidance now recognises the importance of making
   small changes to physical activity behaviour, guidance still focuses on
   adults needing to achieve at least 150 min of MVPA per week. An
   alternative `whole day' approach that could motivate the public to be
   more physically active, is a concept called Snacktivity (TM). Instead of
   focusing on achieving 150 min per week of physical activity, for example
   30 min of MVPA over 5 days, Snacktivity (TM) encourages the public to
   achieve this through small, but frequent, 2-5 min `snacks' of MVPA
   throughout the whole day.
   Methods The primary aim is to undertake a feasibility trial with nested
   qualitative interviews to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
   the Snacktivity (TM) intervention to inform the design of a subsequent
   phase III randomised trial. A two-arm randomised controlled feasibility
   trial aiming to recruit 80 inactive adults will be conducted.
   Recruitment will be from health and community settings and social media.
   Participants will be individually randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive
   either the Snacktivity (TM) intervention or usual care. The intervention
   will last 12 weeks with assessment of outcomes completed before and
   after the intervention in all participants. We are interested in whether
   the Snacktivity (TM) trial is appealing to participants (assessed by the
   recruitment rate) and if the Snacktivity (TM) intervention and trial
   methods are acceptable to participants (assessed by Snacktivity
   (TM)/physical activity adherence and retention rates). The intervention
   will be delivered by health care providers within health care
   consultations or by researchers. Participants' experiences of the trial
   and intervention, and health care providers' views of delivering the
   intervention within health consultations will be explored.
   Discussion The development of physical activity interventions that can
   be delivered at scale are needed. The findings from this study will
   inform the viability and design of a phase III trial to assess the
   effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Snacktivity (TM) to increase
   physical activity.},

Abstract = {Background Drastic increases in the rates of maternal depression and
   anxiety have been reported since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Most
   programs aim to improve maternal mental health or parenting skills
   separately, despite it being more effective to target both concurrently.
   The Building Emotional Awareness and Mental health (BEAM) program was
   developed to address this gap. BEAM is a mobile health program aiming to
   mitigate the impacts of pandemic stress on family well-being. Since many
   family agencies lack infrastructure and personnel to adequately treat
   maternal mental health concerns, a partnership will occur with Family
   Dynamics (a local family agency) to address this unmet need. The study's
   objective is to examine the feasibility of the BEAM program when
   delivered with a community partner to inform a larger randomized
   controlled trial (RCT). Methods A pilot RCT will be conducted with
   mothers who have depression and/or anxiety with a child 6-18 months old
   living in Manitoba, Canada. Mothers will be randomized to the 10 weeks
   of the BEAM program or a standard of care (i.e., MoodMission). Back-end
   App data (collected via Google Analytics and Firebase) will be used to
   examine feasibility, engagement, and accessibility of the BEAM program;
   cost-effectiveness will also be examined. Implementation elements (e.g.,
   maternal depression {[}Patient Health Questionnaire-9] and anxiety
   {[}Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7]) will be piloted to estimate the
   effect size and variance for future sample size calculations. Discussion
   In partnership with a local family agency, BEAM holds the potential to
   promote maternal-child health via a cost-effective and an easily
   accessible program designed to scale. Results will provide insight into
   the feasibility of the BEAM program and will inform future RCTs.},

Abstract = {BackgroundImpairment of arm movement occurs in up to 85\% of people
   post-stroke, affecting daily living activities, and quality of life.
   Mental imagery effectively enhances hand and daily function in people
   with stroke. Imagery can be performed when people imagine themselves
   completing the movement or imagine another person doing it. However,
   there is no report on the specific use of first-person and third-person
   imagery in stroke rehabilitation.AimsTo develop and assess the
   feasibility of the First-Person Mental Imagery (FPMI) and the
   Third-Person Mental Imagery (TPMI) programs to address the hand function
   of people with stroke living in the community.MethodsThis study
   comprises phase 1-development of the FPMI and TPMI programs, and phase
   2-pilot-testing of the intervention programs. The two programs were
   developed from existing literature and reviewed by an expert panel. Six
   participants with stroke, living in the community, participated in the
   pilot-testing of the FPMI and TPMI programs for 2 weeks. Feedback
   collected included the suitability of the eligibility criteria,
   therapist's and participant's adherence to intervention and
   instructions, appropriateness of the outcome measures, and completion of
   the intervention sessions within the specified time.ResultsThe FPMI and
   TPMI programs were developed based on previously established programs
   and included 12 hand tasks. The participants completed four 45-min
   sessions in 2 weeks. The treating therapist adhered to the program
   protocol and completed all the steps within the specified time frame.
   All hand tasks were suitable for adults with stroke. Participants
   followed the instructions given and engaged in imagery. The outcome
   measures selected were appropriate for the participants. Both programs
   showed a positive trend towards improvement in participants' upper
   extremity and hand function and self-perceived performance in activities
   of daily living.ConclusionsThe study provides preliminary evidence that
   these programs and outcome measures are feasible for implementation with
   adults with stroke living in the community. This study outlines a
   realistic plan for future trials in relation to participant recruitment,
   training of therapists on the intervention delivery, and the use of
   outcome measures.},

Title = {A personhood and citizenship training workshop for care home staff to
   potentially increase wellbeing of residents with dementia: intervention
   development and feasibility testing of a cluster randomised controlled
   trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background In the UK, one third of people with dementia live in
   residential care homes, a sector where high staff turnover negatively
   affects continuity of care. To examine the effect of including
   personhood and citizenship principles in training, interventions need to
   be robustly tested, with outcomes relevant to residents with dementia.
   Methods Phase one intervention development: The training intervention
   (PERSONABLE) comprised five reflective exercises facilitated by a mental
   health nurse/researcher. PERSONABLE was informed by four focus groups,
   and one field exercise, consisting of care home staff and family
   members. Phase two feasibility testing: Participants were (i) care home
   residents with dementia and (ii) care home staff working in any role.
   After baseline measurements, care homes were randomly allocated to (i)
   staff receiving PERSONABLE training or (ii) training as usual.
   Feasibility outcomes were the recruitment and attrition of care homes,
   residents and staff members (measured ten weeks between randomisation
   and follow-up), the acceptability of the training intervention
   PERSONABLE, and acceptability of outcome measures. The care home
   environment was evaluated, at baseline, using the Therapeutic
   Environment Screening Survey for Residential Care Homes. Measurements
   conducted at baseline and follow-up were resident wellbeing (Dementia
   Care Mapping (TM)), staff knowledge of and confidence with personhood
   and citizenship (Personhood in Dementia Questionnaire and a perceived
   ability to care visual analogue scale). Inter-rater agreement for
   Dementia Care Mapping (TM) was undertaken at follow-up in one
   intervention and one training as a usual care home. Results Phase one:
   The developed reflective approach to the PERSONABLE exercises appeared
   to give staff a holistic understanding of residents living with
   dementia, seeing them as autonomous people rather than reductively as
   persons with a condition. Phase two: Six care homes, 40 residents and
   118 staff were recruited. Four residents were lost to follow-up.
   Twenty-nine staff in the PERSONABLE arm of the study received the
   training intervention. In the PERSONABLE arm, 26 staff completed both
   baseline and follow-up measurements compared to 21 in the training as
   the usual arm. The most common reason for the loss to follow-up of staff
   was leaving employment. For the outcome measure Dementia Care Mapping
   (TM), the proportion of overall agreement between the two observers was
   18.6\%. High attrition of staff occurred in those homes undergoing
   leadership changes. Conclusion With the right approach, it is possible
   to achieve good engagement during trial recruitment and intervention
   delivery of care home managers, staff and residents. Organisational
   changes are a less controllable aspect of trials but having a visible
   researcher presence during data collection helps to capitalise the
   engagement of those staff remaining in employment. Tailored, brief and
   flexible training interventions encourage staff participation.
   Simplification of study methods helps promote and retain sufficient
   staff in a definitive randomised controlled trial. This study found that
   some components of Dementia Care Mapping (TM) work effectively as an
   outcome measure. However, inter-rater reliability was poor, and the
   practical implementation of the measurement would need a great deal of
   further refinement to accurately capture the effect of a training
   intervention if delivered across a large number of clusters.
   The Dementia Care Mapping (TM) measurement fidelity issue would be
   further complicated if using multiple different unacquainted observers.},

Title = {The ``Family Health = Family Wealth{''} intervention: study protocol for
   a pilot quasi-experimental controlled trial of a multi-level,
   community-based family planning intervention for couples in rural Uganda},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Month = {DEC 24},
Abstract = {Background: Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates globally, but
   only 30\% of women report using an effective method of contraception.
   Community-based, multi-level interventions are needed to help couples in
   rural Uganda overcome barriers to contraceptive use.Methods: This study
   will pilot test the Family Health = Family Wealth intervention, a
   multi-level, community-based intervention employing transformative
   community dialogues, which use facilitated discussion to reshape
   community norms that influence family planning acceptance, to alter
   individual attitudes and the perception of community norms that
   discourage family planning. Community dialogues are delivered to groups
   of couples over 4 sessions (two gender-segregated and two gender-mixed).
   Sessions simultaneously address individual and interpersonal-level
   determinants of family planning and link couples to family planning
   services. At the health system level, a refresher training will be
   conducted with health workers in the intervention community's health
   center to address gaps in contraceptive knowledge and skills as
   identified from a needs assessment.The intervention will be evaluated
   through a pilot quasi-experimental trial paired with a mixed methods
   process evaluation. Participants include 70 couples (N=140) randomized
   by community to the Family Health = Family Wealth intervention (n=35
   couples) or to an attention-matched water, sanitation, and hygiene
   (WASH) intervention (n=35 couples). Participants include sexually
   active, married couples who are age 18 (or an emancipated minor) to 40
   for women and age 18 (or an emancipated minor) to 50 for men, not
   pregnant, at least one person in the couple reports wanting to avoid
   pregnancy for at least a year, and not currently using a method of
   contraception or using a low-efficacy or ineffective method of
   contraception. The primary aims of the study are to (1) assess the
   feasibility of the intervention trial procedures, (2) the acceptability
   and feasibility of the intervention content and structure, and (3)
   explore the intervention's preliminary effectiveness at increasing
   contraceptive use and affecting related outcomes among
   couples.Discussion: Filling the unmet need for family planning has
   important public health implications, including reductions in
   pregnancy-related health risks and deaths, and infant mortality. This
   pilot intervention trial will gather preliminary evidence on the
   acceptability, feasibility, and potential effect of a novel,
   multi-level, community-based intervention to increase contraceptive use
   among couples with an unmet need for family planning in rural Uganda. We
   aim to use the findings of this pilot study to refine the trial
   procedures and intervention content for a future, larger cluster
   randomized controlled trial to establish the intervention's efficacy.},

Abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity and unhealthy dietary habits are known
   to be disadvantageous for the development of late adverse effects in
   survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer. To make
   interventions, aimed at improving lifestyle, fit into the daily life of
   survivors, interventions should be designed and delivered in a
   person-centred way with a limited time burden. As part of the European
   PanCareFollowUp project, an eHealth intervention was developed to
   support sustainable changes to physical activity levels and/or diet of
   childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer survivors. This
   feasibility study aims to gain insight into the feasibility and
   potential effect sizes of the PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention.
   Methods: The PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention consists of
   person-centred 3-6 screen-to-screen sessions with a certified lifestyle
   coach. The intervention will be evaluated with a single-arm pre-post
   feasibility study conducted at two survivorship care clinics in the
   Netherlands. A total of 60 participants who are (i) diagnosed with
   cancer < 25 years, (ii) \& GE; 5 years post-treatment, (iii) aged 16-55
   years, and (iv) have a low physical activity level and/or unhealthy
   dietary intake manifested by overweight will be recruited. Using
   reports, hospital records, and questionnaires for survivors, coaches,
   and late effect doctors, feasibility will be based on (i) adherence to
   intervention, (ii) acceptability, (iii) practicality, (iv)
   integration/implementation, (v) demand, and (vi) attrition. The
   potential effect sizes of the intervention will be explored by
   determining the percentage of survivors that reach the personalized
   lifestyle goals that were set with the coach. Physical activity level,
   dietary intake, BMI, general self-efficacy, self-management, and
   motivation level will be assessed at three time points with
   questionnaires, reports, and/or an accelerometer. Discussion: Data of
   this study will be gathered to assess the feasibility and potential
   effect sizes. This will allow for further intervention refinement as
   needed as well as to inform a future large-scale intervention study and
   a manual for implementation at other centres.},

Abstract = {Background To our knowledge, there is no intervention which includes
   personalised exercise therapy and self-management support for people
   with multimorbidity, although these interventions may be as effective as
   for people with single chronic conditions. Therefore, we developed a
   novel intervention, including personalised exercise therapy and
   self-management support for people with multimorbidity. Methods We
   followed the Medical Research Council framework and conducted one
   scoping review, five systematic reviews, two registry-based studies, one
   qualitative interview study and a mixed-methods feasibility study.
   Following an iterative approach, together with feedback from people with
   multimorbidity and relevant stakeholders, we developed the MOBILIZE
   intervention. Results The intervention included 24 (60 minutes) sessions
   of personalised exercise therapy and 24 (30 minutes) sessions of
   self-management support twice a week for 12 weeks, delivered in small
   groups by specifically trained physiotherapists. The intervention
   targets physiological, psychosocial, behavioural, and contextual factors
   to improve health-related quality of life and physical function in
   people living with multimorbidity. Conclusions We developed a
   personalised exercise therapy and self-management support programme for
   people with multimorbidity. The intervention will be tested for its
   safety and effectiveness in a randomised controlled trial.},

Abstract = {Background: Having a stammer can have a significant effect on a child's
   social, emotional and educational development. With approximately 66,000
   children in the UK having a stammer, there is a need to establish an
   adequate evidence base to inform clinical practice. We describe a
   feasibility trial to explore the effectiveness of a new therapy
   programme for children aged 8-14: Palin Stammering Therapy for School
   Children (Palin STSC(8-14)). Preliminary data from the Michael Palin
   Centre, where the programme was developed, indicate that Palin
   STSC(8-14) is effective in reducing stammering frequency and impact for
   children, with beneficial effects for parents too. We will investigate
   the feasibility of the methods required for a definitive randomised
   controlled trial to investigate the application of this therapy by NHS
   speech and language therapists (SLTs), compared with `treatment as
   usual' (TAU), beyond the specialist context in which it was developed.
   Methods: This is a two-arm feasibility cluster-randomised controlled
   trial of Palin STSC(8-14) with TAU control arm, and randomisation at the
   level of the SLT. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected to
   examine the following: the recruitment and retention of therapists and
   families, the acceptability of the research processes and the
   therapeutic intervention and the appropriateness of the therapy outcome
   measures. Assessments will be completed by children and parents at
   baseline and 6 months later, including measures of stammering severity;
   the impact of child's stammering on both children and parents; child
   temperament, behaviour and peer relations, anxiety; quality of life; and
   economic outcomes. There will also be a qualitative process evaluation,
   including interviews with parents, children, SLTs and SLT managers to
   explore the acceptability of both the research and therapy methods.
   Treatment fidelity will be examined through analysis of therapy session
   records and recordings.
   Discussion: The findings of this feasibility trial will inform the
   decision as to whether to progress to a full-scale randomised controlled
   trial to explore the effectiveness of Palin STSC(8-14) when compared to
   Treatment as Usual in NHS SLT services. There is a strong need for an
   evidence-based intervention for school age children who stammer.},

Title = {Michigan Model for Health™ Learning to Enhance and Adapt for Prevention
   (Mi-LEAP): protocol of a pilot randomized trial comparing Enhanced
   Replicating Effective Programs versus standard implementation to deliver
   an evidence-based drug use prevention curriculum},

Abstract = {Background: School-based drug use prevention programs have demonstrated
   notable potential to reduce the onset and escalation of drug use,
   including among youth at risk of poor outcomes such as those exposed to
   trauma. Researchers have found a robust relationship between
   intervention fidelity and participant (i.e., student) outcomes.
   Effective implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as the
   Michigan Model for Health(TM) (MMH), is critical to achieving desired
   public health objectives. Yet, a persistent gap remains in what we know
   works and how to effectively translate these findings into routine
   practice. The objective of this study is to design and test a
   multi-component implementation strategy to tailor MMH to meet population
   needs (i.e., students exposed to trauma), and improve the
   population-context fit to enhance fidelity and effectiveness.
   Methods: Using a 2-group, mixed-method randomized controlled trial
   design, this study will compare standard implementation versus Enhanced
   Replicating Effective Programs (REP) to deliver MMH. REP is a
   theoretically based implementation strategy that promotes evidence-based
   intervention (EBI) fidelity through a combination of EBI curriculum
   packaging, training, and as-needed technical assistance and is
   consistent with standard MMH implementation. Enhanced REP will tailor
   the intervention and training to integrate trauma-informed approaches
   and deploy customized implementation support (i.e., facilitation). The
   research will address the following specific aims: (1) design and test
   an implementation strategy (Enhanced REP) to deliver the MMH versus
   standard implementation and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and
   appropriateness using mixed methods, (2) estimate the costs and
   cost-effectiveness of Enhanced REP to deliver MMH versus standard
   implementation.
   Discussion: This research will design and test a multi-component
   implementation strategy focused on enhancing the fit between the
   intervention and population needs while maintaining fidelity to MMH core
   functions. We focus on the feasibility of deploying the implementation
   strategy bundle and costing methods and preliminary information on cost
   input distributions. The substantive focus on youth at heightened risk
   of drug use and its consequences due to trauma exposure is significant
   because of the public health impact of prevention. Pilot studies of
   implementation strategies are underutilized and can provide vital
   information on designing and testing effective strategies by addressing
   potential design and methods uncertainties and the effects of the
   implementation strategy on implementation and student outcomes.},

Abstract = {Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition of the central
   nervous system, affecting around 1 in every 600 people in the UK, with
   130 new diagnoses every week. Cognitive difficulties are common amongst
   people with MS, with up to 70\% experiencing deficits in higher-level
   brain functions-such as planning and problem-solving, attention, and
   memory. Cognitive deficits make it difficult for people with MS to
   complete everyday tasks and limit their abilities to work, socialise,
   and live independently. There is a clear need-and recognised research
   priority-for treatments that can improve cognitive functioning in people
   with MS. The absence of effective cognitive interventions exacerbates
   burdens on the services accessed by people with MS-requiring these
   services to manage sequelae of untreated cognitive deficits, including
   reduced quality of life, greater disability and dependence, and poorer
   adherence to disease-modifying treatments. Our planned research will
   fill the evidence gap through developing-and examining the feasibility
   of trialling-a novel online cognitive rehabilitation programme for
   people with MS (SMART). The SMART programme directly trains relational
   skills (the ability to flexibly relate concepts to one another) based on
   theory that these skills are critical to broader cognitive functioning.
   Methods The primary objective of this study aims to conduct a
   feasibility study to inform the development of a definitive trial of
   SMART for improving cognitive functioning in people with MS. The
   secondary objective is to develop the framework for a cost-effectiveness
   analysis alongside a definitive trial, and the exploratory objective is
   to assess the signal of efficacy. Discussion As a feasibility trial,
   outcomes are unlikely to immediately effect changes to NHS practice.
   However, this is a necessary step towards developing a definitive
   trial-and will give us a signal of efficacy, a prerequisite for
   progression to a definitive trial. If found to be clinically and
   cost-effective, the latter trial could create a step-change in MS
   cognitive rehabilitation-improving service delivery and optimising
   support with limited additional resources.},

Title = {Love Together, Parent Together (L2P2): a protocol for a feasibility
   study of a conflict reappraisal writing intervention for interparental
   couples with young children},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced or amplified stress and
   challenge within couples' relationships. Among those who are
   particularly vulnerable to heightened conflict and lower relationship
   satisfaction during this time are interparental couples with young
   children, whose relationships may have already been tenuous prior to the
   pandemic. Stress within the interparental relationship may have ripple
   effects on all family subsystems and child adjustment. The Love Together
   Parent Together (L2P2) program is a brief, low-intensity writing
   intervention adapted for parents of young children that was designed to
   reduce conflict-related distress and prevent declines in relationship
   satisfaction. Based on an original writing intervention by Finkel and
   colleagues, L2P2 has adapted the intervention duration and study
   population to be appropriate to the current global context. This study
   will examine the key feasibility metrics related to this adapted program
   with the goal of identifying problems and informing parameters of future
   pilot and/or main RCTs.
   Methods: The current study is a non-randomized feasibility study, using
   a single-arm, pre-test/post-test design to primarily assess the
   feasibility of an evaluative RCT, and to secondarily assess the
   potential effects on outcomes to be used in a future RCT. Couples will
   be recruited through three community-based agencies with the goal of
   obtaining a socio-demographically diverse sample. The first 20 couples
   to enroll will be included. Baseline and post-intervention surveys will
   be conducted, and a writing intervention will take place (three 7-min
   sessions over the course of 5 weeks). The primary outcomes will be
   feasibility metrics of recruitment rates, appropriateness of eligibility
   criteria, sample diversity, retention, uptake, adherence, and
   acceptability. In addition, we will develop an objective measure of
   couple ``we-ness{''} based on an analysis of writing samples. The
   secondary outcomes will include couples' measures (i.e., relationship
   quality, perceived partner responsiveness, self-reported responsiveness,
   conflict-related distress), and additional family outcomes (i.e.,
   parent-child relations, parental/child mental health). Criteria for
   success are outlined, and failure to meet the criteria will result in
   adaptations to the measurement schedule, intervention design,
   recruitment approach, and/or other elements of the program.
   Discussion: This feasibility study will inform several components of the
   procedures used for a subsequent pilot RCT, in which we will examine the
   feasibility of the methodology used to evaluate the program (e.g.,
   randomization, attrition to follow-up assessment/across groups, and
   sample size estimation, preliminary effectiveness), as well as the main
   RCT, which will investigate the effectiveness of the intervention on
   primary outcome measures and mediating pathways.},

Title = {Muslim Communities Learning About Second-hand Smoke in Bangladesh
   (MCLASS II): a combined evidence and theory-based plus partnership
   intervention development approach},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Introduction Deaths from second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure are
   increasing, but there is not sufficient evidence to recommend a
   particular SHS intervention or intervention development approach.
   Despite the available guidance on intervention reporting, and on the
   role and nature of pilot and feasibility studies, partial reporting of
   SHS interventions is common. The decision-making whilst developing such
   interventions is often under-reported. This paper describes the
   processes and decisions employed during transitioning from the aim of
   adapting an existing mosque-based intervention focused on public health
   messages, to the development of the content of novel community-based
   Smoke-Free Home (SFH) intervention. The intervention aims to promote
   smoke-free homes to reduce non-smokers' exposure to SHS in the home via
   faith-based messages. Methods The development of the SFH intervention
   had four sequential phases: in-depth interviews with adults in
   households in Dhaka, identification of an intervention programme theory
   and content with Islamic scholars from the Bangladesh Islamic Foundation
   (BIF), user testing of candidate intervention content with adults, and
   iterative intervention development workshops with Imams and khatibs who
   trained at the BIF. Results It was judged inappropriately to take an
   intervention adaptation approach. Following the identification of an
   intervention programme theory and collaborating with stakeholders in an
   iterative and collaborative process to identify barriers, six
   potentially modifiable constructs were identified. These were targeted
   with a series of behaviour change techniques operationalised as Quranic
   verses with associated health messages to be used as the basis for
   Khutbahs. Following iterative user testing, acceptable intervention
   content was generated. Conclusion The potential of this community-based
   intervention to reduce SHS exposure at home and improve lung health
   among non-smokers in Bangladesh is the result of an iterative and
   collaborative process. It is the result of the integration of behaviour
   change evidence and theory and community stakeholder contributions to
   the production of the intervention content. This novel combination of
   intervention development frameworks demonstrates a flexible approach
   that could provide insights for intervention development in related
   contexts.},

Title = {Development and evaluation of a remote training strategy for the

Abstract = {Background An increasing number of schools in rural settings are
   implementing multi-tier positive behavioral interventions and supports
   (PBIS) to address school-climate problems. PBIS can be used to provide
   the framework for the implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs)
   to address children's mental health concerns. Given the large service
   disparities for children in rural areas, offering EBPs through PBIS can
   improve access and lead to better long-term outcomes. A key challenge is
   that school personnel need technical assistance in order to implement
   EBPs with fidelity and clinical effectiveness. Providing ongoing on-site
   support is not feasible or sustainable in the majority of rural schools,
   due to their remote physical location. For this reason, remote training
   technology has been recommended for providing technical assistance to
   behavioral health staff (BHS) in under-served rural communities.
   Objectives The purpose of this study is to use the user-centered design,
   guided by an iterative process (rapid prototyping), to develop and
   evaluate the appropriateness, feasibility, acceptability, usability, and
   preliminary student outcomes of two online training strategies for the
   implementation of EBPs at PBIS Tier 2. Methods The study will employ a
   pragmatic design comprised of a mixed-methods approach for the
   development of the training platform, and a hybrid type 2, pilot
   randomized controlled trial to examine the implementation and student
   outcomes of two training strategies: Remote Video vs. Remote Video plus
   Coaching. Discussion There is a clear need for well-designed remote
   training studies focused on training in non-traditional settings. Given
   the lack of well-trained mental health professionals in rural settings
   and the stark disparities in access to services, the development and
   pilot-testing of a remote training strategy for BHS in under-served
   rural schools could have a significant public health impact. Ethics and
   dissemination The project was reviewed and approved by the institutional
   review board. Results will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov and
   disseminated to community partners and participants, peer-reviewed
   journals, and academic conferences.},

Title = {Evaluating the feasibility of a group psychosocial intervention for
   migrant and host community women in Ecuador and Panama: protocol for a

Abstract = {Background: Community- and strengths-based psychosocial interventions
   are central to mental health and psychosocial support guidelines, but
   rigorous evidence regarding the effectiveness of these interventions is
   limited. The complexity and variability that is inherent to many
   community-based psychosocial interventions requires innovative
   strategies in order to facilitate the comparability and synthesis across
   research studies without compromising the fit and appropriateness of
   interventions to specific study populations and context. Entre Nosotras
   is a community-based psychosocial intervention developed for migrant and
   host community women that is designed to be flexible enough to enable
   integration of external intervention components and adaptable to diverse
   study contexts and populations. This protocol describes a study that
   aims to evaluate the appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility of
   integrating a standardized stress management intervention into Entre
   Nosotras.
   Methods: This study will evaluate the appropriateness, acceptability,
   feasibility, and safety of intervention and research procedures for a
   cluster randomized comparative effectiveness trial conducted in Ecuador
   and Panama with migrant and host community women. In this feasibility
   trial, we will allocate communities nested within the three study sites
   to the integrated Entre Nosotras + stress management intervention versus
   Entre Nosotras alone through stratified randomization. Migrant and host
   community women residing in these study communities who report low to
   moderate levels of distress will be allocated to the intervention
   condition that their community is assigned (n = 220 total). We will
   collect quantitative measures of psychosocial wellbeing, psychological
   distress, coping, social support, and functioning from study
   participants. We will collect quantitative measures of fidelity and
   facilitator competencies through observation and facilitator
   self-assessment. Data on appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility,
   and safety will be gathered from participants and facilitators through
   quantitative assessments at 0, 5, and 10 weeks post-enrollment and
   qualitative interviews conducted with all facilitators and a subset of
   70 study participants during the post-intervention follow-up period.
   Discussion: Results from this feasibility trial will determine whether a
   multi-site cluster randomized comparative effectiveness trial of an
   adaptable community-based psychosocial intervention for migrant and host
   community women is relevant, acceptable, and feasible.},

Abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity is a main cause of childhood obesity
   which tracks into adulthood obesity, making it important to address
   early in life. Physical activity on prescription (PAP) is an
   evidence-based intervention that has shown good effect on physical
   activity levels in adults, but has not been evaluated in children with
   obesity. This project aims to evaluate the prerequisites, determinants,
   and feasibility of implementing PAP adapted to children with obesity and
   to explore children's, parents', and healthcare providers' experiences
   of PAP.
   Methods: In the first phase of the project, healthcare providers and
   managers from 26 paediatric clinics in Region Vastra Gotaland, Sweden,
   will be invited to participate in a web-based survey and a subset of
   this sample for a focus group study. Findings from these two data
   collections will form the basis for adaptation of PAP to the target
   group and context. In a second phase, this adapted PAP intervention will
   be evaluated in a clinical study in a sample of approximately 60
   children with obesity (ISO-BMI > 30) between 6 and 12 years of age and
   one of their parents/legal guardians. Implementation process and
   clinical outcomes will be assessed pre- and post-intervention and at 8
   and 12 months' follow-up. Implementation outcomes are the four core
   constructs of the Normalization Process Theory; coherence, cognitive
   participation, collective action, and reflexive monitoring; and
   appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility of the PAP intervention.
   Additional implementation process outcomes are recruitment and attrition
   rates, intervention fidelity, dose, and adherence. Clinical outcomes are
   physical activity pattern, BMI, metabolic risk factors, health-related
   quality of life, sleep, and self-efficacy and motivation for physical
   activity. Lastly, we will explore the perspectives of children and
   parents in semi-structured interviews. Design and analysis of the
   included studies are guided by the Normalization Process Theory.
   Discussion: This project will provide new knowledge regarding the
   feasibility of PAP for children with obesity and about whether and how
   an evidence-based intervention can be fitted and adapted to new contexts
   and populations. The results may inform a larger scale trial and future
   implementation and may enhance the role of PAP in the management of
   obesity in paediatric health care in Sweden.},

Title = {Trialling a microbiome-targeted dietary intervention in children with
   ADHD-the rationale and a non-randomised feasibility study},

Abstract = {Background: Dietary interventions have been previously explored in
   children with ADHD. Elimination diets and supplementation can produce
   beneficial behaviour changes, but little is known about the mechanisms
   mediating change. We propose that these interventions may work, in part,
   by causing changes in the gut microbiota. A microbiome-targeted dietary
   intervention was developed, and its feasibility assessed.
   Methods: A non-randomised feasibility study was conducted on nine
   non-medicated children with ADHD, aged 8-13 years (mean 10.39 years),
   using a prospective one-group pre-test/post-test design. Participants
   were recruited from ADHD support groups in London and took part in the
   6-week microbiome-targeted dietary intervention, which was specifically
   designed to impact the composition of gut bacteria. Children were
   assessed pre- and post-intervention on measures of ADHD symptomatology,
   cognition, sleep, gut function and stool-sample microbiome analysis. The
   primary aim was to assess the study completion rate, with secondary aims
   assessing adherence, adverse events (aiming for no severe and minimal),
   acceptability and suitability of outcome measures.
   Results: Recruitment proved to be challenging and despite targeting 230
   participants directly through support groups, and many more through
   social media, nine families (of the planned 10) signed up for the trial.
   The completion rate for the study was excellent at 100\%. Exploration of
   secondary aims revealed that (1) adherence to each aspect of the dietary
   protocol was very good; (2) two mild adverse events were reported; (3)
   parents rated the treatment as having good acceptability; (4) data
   collection and outcome measures were broadly feasible for use in an RCT
   with a few suggestions recommended; (5) descriptive data for outcome
   measures is presented and suggests that further exploration of gut
   microbiota, ADHD symptoms and sleep would be helpful in future research.
   Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for the
   feasibility of a microbiome-targeted dietary intervention in children
   with ADHD. Recruitment was challenging, but the diet itself was
   well-tolerated and adherence was very good. Families wishing to trial
   this diet may find it an acceptable intervention. However, recruitment,
   even for this small pilot study, was challenging. Because of the
   difficulty experienced recruiting participants, future randomised
   controlled trials may wish to adopt a simpler dietary approach which
   requires less parental time and engagement, in order to recruit the
   number of participants required to make meaningful statistical
   interpretations of efficacy.},

Title = {Health systems strengthening interventions for perinatal common mental
   disorders and experiences of domestic violence in Cape Town, South
   Africa: protocol for a pilot implementation study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Background: During the perinatal period, common mental disorders (CMDs)
   such as depression and anxiety are highly prevalent, especially in
   low-resource settings, and are associated with domestic violence,
   poverty, and food insecurity. Perinatal CMDs have been associated with
   several adverse maternal and child outcomes. While the Department of
   Health in South Africa provides healthcare workers with the tools to
   detect psychological distress and experiences of domestic violence, few
   healthcare workers routinely screen pregnant women at clinic visits,
   citing discomfort with mental health issues and the lack of standardised
   referral pathways as the key barriers. The aim of this study is to
   select and evaluate a set of health systems strengthening (HSS)
   interventions aimed at improving the care and outcomes for perinatal
   women with CMDs and experiences of domestic violence, attending public
   healthcare facilities in Cape Town.
   Methods: This study consists of a pre-implementation, development, and
   implementation phase. Contextual barriers identified during the
   pre-implementation phase included poor patient knowledge and
   health-seeking behaviour, high levels of stigma, and poor detection,
   referral, and treatment rates. Implementation science determinant
   frameworks were applied to findings from the pre-implementation phase to
   identify determinants and gaps in delivering high-quality
   evidence-informed care. A participatory Theory of Change workshop was
   used to design a HSS programme, consisting of awareness raising,
   detection, referral, and treatment. HSS interventions selected to
   support the delivery of the HSS programme includes training, health
   promotion, change to the healthcare environment, task-sharing, audit and
   feedback, and performance monitoring. The implementation phase will be
   used to assess several implementation and clinical outcomes associated
   with the delivery of the HSS programme, which will be piloted at three
   healthcare facilities. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used
   to evaluate the implementation and clinical outcomes.
   Discussion: This pilot implementation study will inform us about a range
   of implementation and clinical outcome measures that are relevant for
   assessing HSS interventions for perinatal women with depression,
   anxiety, or experiences of domestic violence in low-resource settings.
   Lessons learnt from the pilot study will be incorporated into the design
   of a cluster randomised control trial for which further funding will be
   sought.},

Title = {Suubi4Stigma study protocol: a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial
   to address HIV-associated stigma among adolescents living with HIV in
   Uganda},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Background: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is heavily burdened by HIV, with
   85\% of the global new infections among adolescents happening in the
   region. With advances in medication and national policies promoting
   antiretroviral therapy (ART), children < 15 years living with HIV (CLWH)
   continue to grow with a chronic, highly stigmatized disease.
   Unfortunately, the stigma they experience results in much lower quality
   of life, including poor mental health and treatment outcomes. Family
   members also experience stigma and shame by virtue of their association
   with an HIV-infected family member. Yet, stigma-reduction interventions
   targeting CLWH and their families are very limited. The goal of this
   study is to address HIV-associated stigma among CLWH and their
   caregivers in Uganda.
   Methods: This three-arm cluster randomized control trial, known as
   Suubi4Stigma, will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
   preliminary impact of two evidence-based interventions: (1) group
   cognitive behavioral therapy (G-CBT) focused on cognitive restructuring
   and strengthening coping skills at the individual level and (2) a
   multiple family group (MFG) intervention that strengthens family
   relationships to address stigma among CLWH (N = 90, 10-14 years) and
   their families (dyads) in Uganda. Nine clinics will be randomized to one
   of three study arms (n = 3 clinics, 30 child-caregiver dyads each): (1)
   usual care; (2) G-CBT + usual care; and (3) MFG + usual care. Both
   treatment and control conditions will be delivered over a 3-month
   period. Data will be collected at baseline (pre-intervention) and at 3
   months and 6 months post-intervention initiation.
   Conclusion: The primary aim of the proposed project is to address the
   urgent need for theoretically and empirically informed interventions
   that seek to reduce HIV-associated stigma and its negative impact on
   adolescent health and psychosocial well-being. As several countries in
   SSA grapple with care and support for CLWH, this study will lay the
   foundation for a larger intervention study investigating how
   HIV-associated stigma can be reduced to foster healthy child
   development-especially for CLWH as they transition through adolescence.},

Abstract = {Background Bedtime routines are highly recurrent family activities with
   implications for children's wellbeing, development and health. Aims The
   objective of this study is to co-develop and test in a feasibility,
   proof-of-concept study a bedtime routines intervention using text
   messages aimed at first-time parents with young children. Methods Fifty
   first-time parents with children aged 1-3 years were recruited for this
   study. Parents received a text message-based intervention for
   7-consecutive nights which provided support and information on achieving
   optimal bedtime routines. Parents completed pre- and post-intervention
   questionnaires focusing on children's sleep, bedtime routines and
   parental mood disturbance. Feedback was provided at the end of the
   study. Results Recruitment target and high retention with 98\%, or 49
   out of 50 participants completing the study were achieved. Pre- and
   post-intervention, there were improvements in total children's sleep
   with children sleeping longer and having less disrupted sleep overall
   (MD = - 7.77 (SD = 17.91), t(48) = - 3.03, p = .004, CI (- 12.91, -
   2.63) and in overall quality of bedtime routines (MD = - 5.00, SD =
   7.01, t(48) = - 4.98, p < .001, CI (- 7.01, - 2.98). Parental mood
   disturbance decreased pre- to post-intervention (MD = 5.87, SD = 15.43,
   t(48) = 2.66), p = .010, CI (1.44, 10.30). Parents provided positive
   feedback about the intervention and valued the support that was provided
   to them. Conclusions Bedtime routines were successfully altered with
   short-term benefits for children's sleep and parental mood. Future
   research will need to utilize a more robust, longitudinal approach for a
   definite exploration of sustained changes in bedtime routines and their
   long-term implications for children and parents.},

Title = {Development and feasibility testing of a physical activity intervention
   for youth with anxiety and depression: a study protocol},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders in children and adolescents
   are highly prevalent and account for more than half of all youth
   psychiatric disorders. Left untreated, anxiety, and depression lead to
   numerous detrimental outcomes, including reduced quality of life,
   psychiatric, and somatic comorbidity and even reduced lifespan. This
   puts a large strain on child and adolescent mental healthcare services
   (CAMHS) to provide effective treatments. However, even when provided the
   best evidence-based treatment, between 40-50\% of patients continue to
   report significant symptom burdens. Thus, there is an immediate need for
   supplemental and/or new treatment approaches. Physical activity as a
   supplementary treatment may be such an approach. However, research
   investigating this approach within this population is scant. This
   protocol paper describes the development and feasibility trial of a
   physical activity-based intervention targeting anxiety and depressive
   symptoms in youth treated in CAMHS.
   Methods/design: The study is based on the UK Medical Council Research
   Framework (MRC) for developing and evaluating complex interventions.
   Feasibility and acceptability of the physical activity intervention
   (confident, active, and happy youth) will be evaluated in an
   uncontrolled open-label trial using qualitative and quantitative data.
   Twenty youths with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be recruited.
   Acceptability of assessment procedures, the intervention, and perceived
   benefits and barriers to participation will be assessed, and qualitative
   interviews with participants, caregivers, and referring specialists will
   explore contextual and practical factors associated with intervention
   delivery. Physical activity will be measured using the Actigraph GT3X+
   monitor at baseline, and post-intervention and change in anxiety and
   depression will be assessed.
   Discussion: This study will contribute to the development of
   supplementary physical treatment interventions for youth with anxiety
   and depression in contact with CAMHS. The goal is to examine new avenues
   of treatment that ultimately may improve upon current treatment outcomes
   of anxiety and depression. This work will be in preparation for a future
   definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) of this approach, in line
   with the MRC Framework.},

Title = {`Making the most of together time': development of a Health Visitor-led
   intervention to support children's early language and communication
   development at the 2-21/2-year-old review},

Abstract = {Background Early interventions to support young children's language
   development through responsive parent-child interaction have proven
   efficacy but are not currently delivered universally. A potential
   universal delivery platform is the Health Visitor (HV)-led
   2-21/2-year-old review in England's Healthy Child Programme. It is
   unclear if it is feasible to offer such interventions through this
   platform. We report an intervention development process, including
   extensive stakeholder consultation and co-design which aimed to develop
   an acceptable, feasible and equitable early language intervention for
   delivery in this context. Methods The study involved five phases
   including 13 stakeholder co-design workshops with 7 parents and 39
   practitioners (HVs, early years practitioners and speech and language
   therapists): (1) Identification of existing intervention evidence, (2)
   qualitative review of intervention studies extracting candidate target
   behaviours for intervention and intervention techniques, (3) co-design
   workshops with parents and practitioners examining acceptability,
   barriers and enablers to those behaviours and techniques (particular
   attention was paid to diverse family circumstances and the range of
   barriers which might exist), (4) findings were analysed using COM-B and
   theoretical domains frameworks and a prototype intervention model
   designed, and (5) co-design workshops iteratively refined the proposed
   model. Results Practitioners were committed to offering language
   intervention at the 2-21/2-year-old review but were not sure precisely
   how to do so. Parents/caregivers wanted to be proactive and to have
   agency in supporting their own children and to do this as soon as
   possible. For equitable intervention, it must be proportionate, with
   higher `intensity' for higher levels of disadvantage, and tailored,
   offering differing approaches considering the specific barriers and
   enablers, assets and challenges in each family. The importance and
   potential fragility of alliances between parent/caregiver and
   practitioner were identified as key, and so, strategies to engender
   successful collaborative partnership are also embedded in intervention
   design. Conclusion It is possible to develop a universal intervention
   which parents and practitioners judge would be acceptable, feasible and
   equitable for use at the 2-21/2-year review to promote children's
   language development. The result is one of the most explicitly developed
   universal interventions to promote children's language development.
   Further development and piloting is required to develop materials to
   support successful widespread implementation.},

Title = {`Playlist for Life' at the end of life: a mixed-methods feasibility
   study of a personalised music listening intervention in the hospice
   setting},

Abstract = {Background Playlist for Life is a brief, inexpensive music listening
   intervention which originated in dementia care, but is increasingly
   being used for people at the end of life. However, there is a lack of
   robust empirical research on its application in the hospice setting. Our
   patient and public involvement group originated the idea for this study.
   The aim of this feasibility study was to inform the design of a larger
   effectiveness study on the use of Playlist for Life in the hospice
   setting. Method This study was a mixed-methods feasibility study
   involving adults at the end of life, family members and hospice staff
   from one in-patient hospice in Scotland. Eligible patient/family member
   dyads were approached by hospice staff and if interested, recruited by
   the researcher. All included participants received the intervention,
   which involved the provision of an MP3 player and assistance to set up a
   playlist. Participants were asked to listen to the playlist daily during
   the intervention period (7 days). Data were collected through patient
   reported outcome measures and on days 1, 3 and 7 of the intervention
   period and through participant observation session. Patient/family
   member dyads and hospice staff also took part in qualitative interviews
   (Appendix 1) post-intervention, which were audio-recorded, transcribed
   and analysed thematically. Semi-structured interviews at the end of the
   intervention period were used to evaluate feasibility and acceptability.
   An advisory group including patients, family members and staff gave
   helpful feedback on the qualitative interview questions. Interview
   questions were the same for all participants and all the questions were
   asked to all participants. Results N = 15 participants were recruited (n
   = 5 patients, n = 5 family, n = 5 staff. The intervention was appraised
   positively, particularly regarding its beneficial effect on
   patient/family relationships. The study design was deemed feasible and
   acceptable. Conclusion The findings of this study will inform the
   development of a future randomised cluster trial designed to assess the
   usability and effectiveness of the Playlist for Life personalised music
   intervention.},

Abstract = {Background Pilot/feasibility studies play an important role in the
   development and refinement of behavioral interventions by providing
   information about feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy.
   Despite their importance and wide-spread use, the approaches taken by
   behavioral scientists to scale-up early-stage studies to larger-scale
   trials has received little attention. The aim of our study was to
   understand the role that pilot studies play in the development and
   execution of larger-scale trials. Methods We conducted interviews with
   childhood obesity researchers who had published pilot behavioral
   interventions and larger-scale trials of the same or similar
   interventions. Questions were asked about the role of pilot studies in
   developing larger-scale trials and the challenges encountered when
   scaling-up an intervention based upon pilot findings. Data were coded
   and analyzed using an inductive analytic approach to identify themes.
   Results Twenty-four interventionists (54\% women, 37-70 years old, mean
   20 years since terminal degree) completed a total of 148 pilot studies
   across their careers (mean 6.4, range 1-20), of which 59\% were
   scaled-up. Scaling was described as resource intensive and pilot work
   was considered essential to successfully competing for funding by 63\%
   of the sample (n = 15). When asked to define a high-quality pilot study,
   interventionists described studies that allowed them to evaluate two
   independent factors: components of their intervention (e.g.,
   acceptability, feasibility) and study parameters (e.g., sample size,
   measures). Interventionists expressed that more process implementation
   measures, different study designs, and additional iterations could
   improve decisions to scale-up. Most agreed that pilot studies were
   likely to produce inflated estimates of potential efficacy though only
   nine interventionists provided potential solutions for decreasing
   inflated measures of efficacy. Suggested major causes of inflated
   effects included high levels of oversight in pilot studies (e.g.,
   researcher support), reliance on subjective measures, and utilizing
   convenience or highly motivated samples. Potential solutions included
   designing pilots for real-world implementation, only conducting
   randomized controlled pilot studies, and pre-registering pilot studies.
   Conclusions Pilot studies purposes are multifaceted and deemed essential
   to obtaining funding for larger-scale trials. Clarifying the form and
   function of preliminary, early-stage research may enhance the productive
   utilization of early-stage studies and reduced drops in efficacy when
   transitioning to larger scale studies.},

Title = {The feasibility and acceptability of a brief psychological intervention

Abstract = {Background: Adults with long-term health conditions (LTCs) are more
   likely to experience depressive symptoms which can worsen health
   outcomes and quality of life, and increase healthcare costs.
   Subthreshold depression may go undetected and/or untreated.
   The Community Pharmacies Mood Intervention Study (CHEMIST) explored
   whether community pharmacies represent a suitable setting to offer brief
   psychological support to people with LTCs and comorbid subthreshold
   depression.
   Methods: A feasibility intervention study with a nested mixed methods
   evaluation was employed. Adults with subthreshold depression and a
   minimum of one LTC were recruited from community pharmacies/local
   general practices and offered a brief psychological support intervention
   ('Enhanced Support Intervention' (ESI)), based on behavioural activation
   within a Collaborative Care framework. The intervention included up to
   six sessions supported by pharmacy staff ('ESI facilitators') trained to
   deliver the ESI within the community pharmacy setting.
   Recruitment, retention rates and engagement with the ESI were assessed.
   Semi-structured, one-to-one interviews with pharmacy staff and study
   participants, and a focus group with pharmacy staff, explored
   experiences and acceptability of the study and the ESI. Themes were
   mapped onto constructs of the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability.
   Results: Recruitment of ESI participants was challenging and slower than
   anticipated despite the varied methods of recruitment employed;
   although, this was useful in identifying barriers and enabling factors
   for participation. Engagament with the ESI was good with n=17 (71\%)
   recruited participants commencing the ESI. The ESI was found to be
   acceptable to participants and ESI facilitators. Retention rate at 4
   months was good n=20 (87.0\%).
   Conclusions: Community pharmacies were viewed as an acceptable setting
   in which to deliver preventative brief psychological support to people
   with LTCs at risk of depression.
   This feasibility study provided important data to inform the design of a
   pilot randomised controlled trial in this setting and highlighted
   important considerations for future pharmacy-based research.},

Abstract = {Background: Many individuals with intellectual disability (ID) have not
   learnt basic reading skills by the time that they reach adulthood,
   potentially limiting their access to critical information. READ-IT is an
   online reading programme developed from the Headsprout (R) Early Reading
   (HER (R)) intervention and supplemented by support strategies tailored
   for adults with ID. HER (R) has been successfully used to teach adults
   with ID to read in a forensic setting by trained staff. The aim of this
   study is to assess the feasibility of delivering READ-IT to adults with
   ID by family carers/support workers and will assess whether it would be
   feasible to conduct a later definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT)
   of the effectiveness of the programme. The study will aim to contribute
   to the evidence base on improving outcomes for adults with ID and their
   caregivers.
   Methods: This study is a feasibility RCT, with embedded process
   evaluation. Forty-eight adults with ID will be recruited and allocated
   to intervention: control on a 1:1 basis. Intervention families will be
   offered the READ-IT programme immediately, continuing to receive usual
   practice and control participants will be offered the opportunity to
   receive READ-IT at the end of the trial follow-up period and will
   continue to receive usual practice. Data will be collected at baseline
   and 6 months post-randomisation.
   Discussion: The results of this study will inform a potential future
   definitive trial, to evaluate the effectiveness of READ-IT to improve
   reading skills. Such a trial would have significant scientific impact
   internationally in the intellectual disability field.},

Abstract = {Background Dance is a mind-body activity of purposeful rhythmic movement
   to music. There is growing interest in using dance as a form of
   cognitive and physical rehabilitation. This manuscript describes the
   development of GERAS DANcing for Cognition and Exercise (DANCE) and
   evaluates its feasibility in older adults with cognitive and mobility
   impairments. Methods The progressive dance curricula were delivered for
   15 weeks (1-h class; twice weekly). Participants were eligible if they
   were community-dwelling older adults aged 60+ with early cognitive or
   mobility impairment able to follow three-step commands and move
   independently. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment/retention,
   adherence, participant satisfaction, safety, and adverse events. Results
   Twenty-five older adults (mean (standard deviation {[}SD]) age = 77.55
   (6.10) years, range 68-90 years) with early cognitive (Montreal
   Cognitive Assessment score (SD) = 21.77 (4.05)) and mobility (92\% were
   pre-frail/frail as indicated on the Fried Frailty Phenotype) impairments
   were recruited from a geriatric out-patient clinic or within the
   community. A total of 20/25 (80\%) participants completed the study.
   Average class attendance was 72\%, and self-reported homework adherence
   ``most-days / every day{''} was 89\%. A stepwise progression in the
   dance curricula was observed with increases in motor complexity and
   balance demands, and 95\% of participants rated the program as a
   ``just-right{''} challenge. Ninety percent of participants rated GERAS
   DANCE as excellent, and 100\% would recommend the program to a friend or
   family member. Over 50\% of participants connected outside of class time
   for a self-initiated coffee club. Adverse events of falls and fractures
   were reported for 2 participants, which occurred at home unrelated to
   the dance intervention during the study period. Pre-determined
   thresholds for feasibility were met for all outcomes. Discussion GERAS
   DANCE is a feasible and enjoyable program for older adults with early
   cognitive or mobility impairments. GERAS DANCE curriculum grading
   (duration; sequence; instructions) and motor complexity increases in
   agility, balance, and coordination appear appropriately tailored for
   this population. Future work will explore the feasibility of GERAS DANCE
   in new settings (i.e., virtually online, community centers, or
   retirement homes) and the mind-body-social benefits of dance.},

Title = {CHoosing Active Role Models to INspire Girls (CHARMING): protocol for a
   cluster randomised feasibility trial of a school-based, community-linked

Abstract = {Background: In the UK, there is evidence that girls' physical activity
   tends to decline to a greater extent than boys as they enter
   adolescence. `Role models' could play a vital role in inspiring girls to
   become or remain physically active. The CHARMING Programme is a primary
   school-based community linked role-model programme, co-developed in
   2016, with children, parents, schools and wider stakeholders. It
   involves different types of physical activity delivered for 1-h each
   week by a community provider and peer role models (e.g. older girls from
   secondary schools) joining in with the sessions. The programme
   ultimately aims to increase and sustain physical activity levels among
   9-10-year-old girls. This study aims to assess the feasibility and
   acceptability of the CHARMING Programme and of evaluating it using a
   randomised trial.
   Methods: This study is a feasibility cluster randomised controlled
   trial, with embedded process evaluation and health economic evaluation.
   Approximately 90 Year 5 (i.e. 9-10-year-old) girls will be recruited
   across six primary schools in Mid-South Wales. Participating schools
   will be allocated to the programme: control on a 2:1 basis; four
   intervention schools will run the CHARMING Programme and two will
   continue with usual practice. A survey and accelerometer will be
   administered at baseline and repeated at 12 months. Interviews and focus
   groups will be conducted post-intervention delivery. The primary aim is
   to assess feasibility of a future randomised trial via the recruitment
   of schools, participants and role models; randomisation; retention;
   reach; data collection completion rates; programme adherence; and
   programme fidelity, views on intervention acceptability and programme
   barriers and facilitators. Secondary aims are to evaluate established
   physical activity outcome measures for children plus additional health
   economic outcomes for inclusion in a future full-scale trial.
   Discussion: The results of this study will inform decisions on whether
   and how to proceed to a full-scale evaluation of the effectiveness and
   cost-effectiveness of the CHARMING Programme to improve or sustain
   physical activity.},

Title = {Potential efficacy of parent-infant psychotherapy with mothers and their

Abstract = {Background: Psychotherapy of mother-child dyads is an intervention which
   was developed to prevent maltreatment and negative children's
   development. There is a lack of good-quality research investigating
   psychotherapeutic interventions and social care for mothers at high-risk
   living in Mother-Child Facilities in Germany. The present randomized
   controlled pilot trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate the need for
   parent-infant psychotherapy (PIP) and to explore its impact on the
   mother-infant relationship. Primary feasibility objectives were
   recruitment and attrition, with potential efficacy defined as the
   secondary feasibility objective.
   Methods: This pilot RCT focused on (young) mothers with cumulative risk
   factors and their infants under 7 months of age living in Mother-Child
   Facilities. N=32 mother-child dyads were randomly allocated to PIP or
   Care as usual (CAU). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6
   months of intervention. The primary potential efficacy outcome was
   maternal sensitivity. Secondary outcomes were maternal mental health
   problems, reflective functioning, parenting stress, personality
   organization, infant's development, and attachment.
   Results: At baseline, all mothers showed low levels of emotional
   availability, but results revealed improvements in sensitivity, mental
   health problems, stress, and depressive symptomatology favoring PIP
   after 6 months. Positive developments in maternal sensitivity, a healthy
   aspect of mother-child interaction, were only found in the PIP group.
   Overall attrition was high at 6 months. Some evidence of fewer
   depressive symptoms and lower maternal distress after 6 months of
   PIP-intervention exists that did not reach significance.
   Conclusion: Findings revealed improvements in the mother's well-being
   for both groups, but PIP had a higher impact on the mother-child dyad.
   In sum, there is some evidence that PIP may represent an effective
   intervention offer besides the social and pedagogical support in these
   facilities, but further research is demanded.},
