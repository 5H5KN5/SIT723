Abstract = {BackgroundStudent-athletes are one subgroup of college students in the
   USA at risk for dating violence and sexual risk behaviors. Despite this,
   research on student-athletes' dating behaviors is limited; existing
   research pertains primarily to the National Collegiate Athletic
   Association (NCAA) Division I athletes and focuses on male
   student-athletes as perpetrators of dating and sexual violence. While
   some existing programs aim to reduce dating violence and promote healthy
   relationships, these programs are education based, and not tailored to
   the specific strengths and challenges of student-athletes. We therefore
   designed Supporting Prevention in Relationships for Teams (SPoRT), a
   novel, four-session prevention intervention for Division III
   student-athletes of all genders to reduce dating violence and sexual
   risk behavior by targeting knowledge and skills identified in pilot
   research, incorporating psychoeducation with techniques from
   cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, bystander intervention, and
   normative feedback.MethodsThis study represents stage 1 of the National
   Institutes of Health (NIH) Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention
   Development, evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of SPoRT. We
   describe the development, content, and proposed delivery methods for
   SPoRT and evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of the program
   using a mixed-methods approach. Thirty college student-athletes (12 men,
   18 women) completed questionnaires and participated in focus groups to
   provide feedback on the program's length, timing, group size and
   dynamics, content, and suggestions for making the SPoRT prevention
   intervention more feasible and acceptable.ResultsOur recruitment
   procedures were successful, and participants rated the program as
   feasible in terms of delivery methods and logistics. Participants liked
   that SPoRT was developed based on pilot data collected from
   student-athletes, brief, and skills based and tailored to athletic team
   needs. SPoRT was perceived as appropriate and relevant to
   student-athlete needs in terms of dating violence and sexual risk
   prevention knowledge and skills. Most participants (63\%) rated the
   program as ``excellent{''} and said they would recommend it to
   others.ConclusionsWe found SPoRT to be both feasible and acceptable in
   terms of content and delivery. Suggested modifications will be
   incorporated into the SPoRT healthy relationships prevention
   intervention to be tested in an NIH Stage 1 efficacy trial.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPhysical activity (PA) counseling holds promise for increasing
   PA levels in people with chronic respiratory disease, though little
   long-term change has been shown to date. Here, we describe the
   development of a Health Action Process Approach-based PA counseling
   intervention that aims to promote PA and exercise in people with chronic
   respiratory disease who are enrolled in pulmonary
   rehabilitation.MethodsTo collaborate in defining and refining the
   intervention, we convened a varied team of authors that included a panel
   of five stakeholder partners: three patients, one clinician, and one
   health behavior change researcher. We completed three steps in the
   intervention development process: (1) initial intervention creation, (2)
   iterative intervention refinement, and (3) assessment of intervention
   acceptability. In step 1, we created an initial draft of the PA
   counseling intervention based on the HAPA theoretical framework,
   previous evidence in people with chronic respiratory disease, and
   clinical experience. In step 2, we used qualitative methods of focus
   groups and interviews to further develop and refine the intervention.
   Fifteen meetings occurred with the five-member stakeholder partner panel
   (six focus groups with the three patient partners, four interviews with
   the clinician partner, and five interviews with the researcher partner)
   over 5 months to systematically elicit input and incorporate it into the
   intervention. In step 3, we measured the intervention acceptability
   using five-point Likert scale ratings.ResultsIntervention materials
   included the eligibility screen, participant workbook, and leader guide.
   We identified key themes in the input from the stakeholder partners and
   incorporated this input into the intervention content and methods.
   Ratings of the intervention by the stakeholder partners (n=5) were high
   with mean ratings ranging 4.0-5.0 on a five-point scale.ConclusionsThis
   development process successfully engaged an intervention development
   team with diverse perspectives and resulted in a PA counseling
   intervention for people with chronic respiratory disease. The
   intervention's strong theoretical underpinning, person-centeredness, and
   the contributions from varied perspectives during intervention
   development position it well for future evaluations of feasibility,
   efficacy, and effectiveness.},

Abstract = {BackgroundNon-memory-led dementias such as posterior cortical atrophy
   (PCA), primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and behavioural variant
   frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are low prevalent and often affect
   individuals under the age of 65. Tailored educational and support
   resources for caregivers of people living with these dementia phenotypes
   are scarce and unevenly distributed geographically. Web-based
   educational programmes are emerging as promising alternatives to improve
   caregiver self-efficacy and well-being. Here, we present the protocol of
   a study aiming to assess the feasibility of a co-produced online
   educational programme for caregivers of people living PCA, PPA and
   bvFTD: the Better Living with Non-memory-led Dementia programme.MethodsA
   randomised controlled feasibility trial will be conducted on a sample of
   30 caregivers of people living with PCA, PPA and bvFTD. Participants
   will be recruited among members of the support organisation Rare
   Dementia Support (based at UCL in the UK). The intervention group will
   be given access to an 8-week co-produced web-based educational programme
   consisting of 6 modules addressing education about PCA, PPA and bvFTD
   and support strategies for the person with dementia and for the
   caregiver. The control group will receive treatment as usual (TAU).
   Feasibility will be measured through feasibility of recruitment,
   clinical measurement tools and acceptability. Clinical measures will be
   used to assess preliminary efficacy and data on completion rates,
   missing data and variability used to decide on measures to be included
   in a full-scale trial.Allocation ratio will be 2:1
   (intervention:control) stratified by diagnosis. Feasibility of
   recruitment and acceptability will be assessed. Clinical measures will
   be administered at baseline and 8-week and 3-month post-randomisation.
   The control group will be offered access to the intervention at the
   completion of data collection. Participants will be unblinded, and all
   measures will be self-reported online.MethodsA randomised controlled

Abstract = {BackgroundObesity is a chronic disease and is an established risk factor
   for other chronic diseases and mortality. Young adulthood is a period
   when people may be highly amenable to healthy behavior change, develop
   lifelong healthy behaviors, and when primary prevention of obesity may
   be feasible. Interventions in early adulthood have the potential for
   primary or primordial prevention (i.e., preventing risk factors before
   disease onset). The primary objective of this study is to determine the
   feasibility of a 6-month behavioral and educational intervention to
   promote healthy behaviors for obesity prevention among young
   adults.MethodsThis is the study protocol for a pilot randomized
   controlled trial. Young adults (age 18-29) attending McMaster
   University, Hamilton, Canada, will be recruited and randomized to either
   the intervention or control. The intervention will include individual
   motivational interviewing sessions (online or in-person) with a trained
   interviewer plus educational materials (based on Canada's food guide and
   physical activity recommendations). The control group will receive
   educational materials only. The primary feasibility outcomes that will
   be evaluated as part of this pilot study include enrollment, retention
   (\& GE; 80\%), data completion (\& GE; 80\% of weights measured, and
   surveys completed), and participant satisfaction. Secondary clinical
   outcomes will include body mass index (BMI) change from baseline to 6
   months, physical activity, nutrition risk, health-related quality of
   life mental health, and economic outcomes. Outcomes will be measured
   remotely using activity trackers, and online questionnaires at baseline
   and every 2 months. Risk stratification will be applied at baseline to
   identify participants at high risk of obesity (e.g., due to family or
   personal history). Exit questionnaires will collect data on how
   participants felt about the study and cost analysis will be
   conducted.DiscussionOur pilot randomized controlled trial will evaluate
   the feasibility of an obesity prevention intervention in early adulthood
   and will inform future larger studies for obesity prevention. The
   results of this study have the potential to directly contribute to the
   primary prevention of several types of cancer by testing an intervention
   that could be scalable to public health, post-secondary education, or
   primary care settings.Trial

Abstract = {BackgroundStress levels and thus the risk of developing related physical
   and mental health conditions are rising worldwide. Dysfunctional beliefs
   contribute to the development of stress. Potentially, such beliefs can
   be modified with approach-avoidance modification trainings (AAMT). As
   previous research indicates that effects of AAMTs are small, there is a
   need for innovative ways of increasing the efficacy of these
   interventions. For this purpose, we aim to evaluate the feasibility of
   the intervention and study design and explore the efficacy of an
   innovative emotion-based AAMT version (eAAMT) that uses the display of
   emotions to move stress-inducing beliefs away from and draw
   stress-reducing beliefs towards oneself.MethodsWe will conduct a
   parallel randomized controlled pilot study at the
   Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany. Individuals
   with elevated stress levels will be randomized to one of eight study
   conditions (n = 10 per condition) - one of six variants of the eAAMT, an
   active control intervention (swipe-based AAMT), or an inactive control
   condition. Participants in the intervention groups will engage in four
   sessions of 20-30 min (e)AAMT training on consecutive days. Participants
   in the inactive control condition will complete the assessments via an
   online tool. Non-blinded assessments will be taken directly before and
   after the training and 1 week after training completion. The primary
   outcome will be perceived stress. Secondary outcomes will be
   dysfunctional beliefs, symptoms of depression, emotion regulation
   skills, and physiological stress measures. We will compute effect sizes
   and conduct mixed ANOVAs to explore differences in change in outcomes
   between the eAAMT and control conditions.DiscussionThe study will
   provide valuable information to improve the intervention and study
   design. Moreover, if shown to be effective, the approach can be used as
   an automated smartphone-based intervention. Future research needs to
   identify target groups benefitting from this intervention utilized
   either as stand-alone treatment or an add-on intervention that is
   combined with other evidence-based treatments.Trial registrationThe
   trial has been registered in the German Clinical Trials Register
   (Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien; DRKS00023007; September 7,
   2020).},

Abstract = {Background Food gardening may positively influence cardiovascular
   disease (CVD) risk-related behaviors. However, the vast majority of
   existing gardening interventions have used an in-person delivery model
   which has limitations for scalability. It is not known whether a
   digitally delivered gardening intervention would be feasible or
   acceptable to participants. The purpose of this pilot study was to
   assess the feasibility of a digitally delivered gardening intervention
   in three domains: participant acceptability, demand, and practicality.
   Methods A single-arm, pre-post-study design was used. Participants (n =
   30) were aged 20 + with no plans to garden in the coming season and had
   at least 1 CVD risk factor. The intervention included ten 1-h
   video-conferencing sessions, written materials, and access to a study
   website. Content focused on gardening skills, cooking skills, and the
   Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Feasibility
   outcomes included acceptability (postprogram ratings), demand (session
   attendance rate), and practicality (ability to start a garden and grow
   F\&V). The study was considered feasible if the following criteria were
   met: = 70\% rated the intervention as good or excellent, overall session
   attendance rate was = 70\%, and > 70\% were able to start a garden and
   grow F\&V. We also assessed prepost-program changes in behavioral
   mediators (gardening confidence, gardening enjoyment, cooking
   confidence, and nutrition knowledge). Descriptive statistics were
   calculated. Pre-post differences were evaluated with means and 95\%
   confidence intervals (95\% CI). Effect sizes were calculated (Cohen's
   d).
   Results All feasibility criteria were met. A total of 93.3\% of
   participants rated the intervention as good or excellent, 96\% started a
   garden and grew F\&V, and the overall session attendance rate was 81\%.
   The largest mean pre-post changes were in gardening confidence (pre 7.1
   {[}95\% CI: 6.4, 7.9], post 9.0 {[}95\% CI: 8.6, 9.5], Cohen's d =
   1.15), gardening enjoyment (pre: 6.3 {[}95\% CI: 5.9, 6.7], post: 7.5
   {[}95\% CI: 7.1, 7.9], Cohen's d = 1.69), and cooking self-efficacy
   (pre: 4.7 {[}95\% CI: 4.3, 5.1], post: 7.7 {[}95\% CI: 7.3, 8.0],
   Cohen's d = 3.0).
   Conclusion A digitally delivered gardening intervention was feasible,
   acceptable to participants, and they had meaningful changes in
   behavioral mediators. The next step is to evaluate the impact of the
   intervention in a future randomized controlled trial.},

Abstract = {Background Teacher-delivered behavioral classroom management
   interventions are effective for students with or at-risk for
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other disruptive
   behavior challenges, but they can be difficult for teachers to use in
   the classroom. In this study, we will pilot test a package of
   implementation strategies to support teachers in using behavioral
   classroom interventions for students with ADHD symptoms.
   Methods We will use a 2-group, randomized controlled trial to compare
   outcomes for teachers who receive Positive Behavior Management
   Implementation Resources (PBMIR), a theory and data-driven
   implementation resource package designed to increase teacher
   implementation of behavioral classroom management interventions, with
   those who do not receive this additional implementation support. We will
   measure teacher implementation outcomes (e.g., observed fidelity to
   behavioral classroom interventions) and student clinical outcomes (e.g.,
   ADHD-related impairment, ADHD symptoms, student-teacher relationship,
   academic performance) before and after an 8-week intervention period for
   both groups; we will also measure teacher-reported acceptability,
   appropriateness, and feasibility for the PBMIR group following the
   intervention period.
   Discussion If there is preliminary evidence of feasibility and
   effectiveness, this pilot study will provide the foundation for
   evaluation the PBMIR at a larger scale and the potential to improve
   outcomes for students with or at risk for ADHD.},

Abstract = {BackgroundMental wellbeing encompasses life satisfaction, social
   connectedness, agency and resilience. In adolescence, mental wellbeing
   reduces sexual health risk behaviours, substance use and violence;
   improves educational outcomes; and protects mental health in adulthood.
   Mental health promotion seeks to improve mental wellbeing and can
   include activities to engage participants in sport. However, few
   high-quality trials of mental health promotion interventions have been
   conducted with adolescents, especially in low- and middle-income
   countries. We sought to address this gap by testing SMART (Sports-based
   Mental heAlth pRomotion for adolescenTs) in a pilot cluster-randomised
   controlled trial (cRCT) in Bardiya, Nepal.MethodsThe objectives of the
   trial are to assess the acceptability and feasibility of SMART, test
   trial procedures, explore outcome distributions in intervention and
   control clusters and calculate the total annual cost of the intervention
   and unit cost per adolescent. The trial design is a parallel-group,
   two-arm superiority pilot cRCT with a 1:1 allocation ratio and two
   cross-sectional census surveys with adolescents aged 12-19, one
   pre-intervention (baseline) and one post-intervention (endline). The
   study area is four communities of approximately 1000 population (166
   adolescents per community). Each community represents one cluster. SMART
   comprises twice weekly football, martial arts and dance coaching, open
   to all adolescents in the community, led by local sports coaches who
   have received psychosocial training. Sports melas (festivals) and
   theatre performances will raise community awareness about SMART, mental
   health and the benefits of sport. Adolescents in control clusters will
   participate in sport as usual. In baseline and endline surveys, we will
   measure mental wellbeing, self-esteem, self-efficacy, emotion
   regulation, social support, depression, anxiety and functional
   impairment. Using observation checklists, unstructured observation and
   attendance registers from coaching sessions, and minutes of meetings
   between coaches and supervisors, we will assess intervention fidelity,
   exposure and reach. In focus group discussions and interviews with
   coaches, teachers, caregivers and adolescents, we will explore
   intervention acceptability and mechanisms of change. Intervention costs
   will be captured from monthly project accounts, timesheets and
   discussions with staff members.DiscussionFindings will identify elements
   of the intervention and trial procedures requiring revision prior to a
   full cRCT to evaluate the effectiveness of SMART.},

Abstract = {Background Social-emotional capacities contribute to children's mental
   health by helping them navigate their own and others' emotional states
   and forge healthy relationships. Caregivers and educators are critical
   socialization agents in early and middle childhood, but gaps remain in
   the systematic integration of social-emotional research into caregiver
   and educator trainings. The aim of this pilot study was to test the
   feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a social-emotional training
   designed to promote caregivers' and educators' capacities to support
   social-emotional development in children ages 3-8 years.Methods Fifty
   adults (n = 24 caregivers of children ages 3-8 years, n = 26 educators
   working with children ages 3-8 years) participated in a virtual training
   over 3 weeks. Participants completed pre-training, post-training, and
   2-month follow-up questionnaires evaluating their knowledge of
   social-emotional concepts, use of training strategies, mental health,
   and satisfaction with the training. Caregivers also reported children's
   social-emotional capacities and mental health.Results On average,
   caregivers and educators completed 83\% of the virtual training sessions
   and reported high satisfaction with the training. Further, preliminary
   evidence indicated that caregivers' and educators' knowledge of
   social-emotional concepts increased pre- to post-training and was
   maintained at the 2-month follow-up. Increases in caregivers' and
   educators' knowledge and greater use of training strategies were
   associated with improvements in children's social-emotional capacities
   and caregivers' and educators' own mental health.Conclusions These pilot
   results support the feasibility of infusing evidence-based
   social-emotional content into caregiver and educator training
   initiatives aimed at nurturing child social-emotional development and
   mental health. The results inform future evaluation of the short- and
   long-term benefits of this training with a full-scale randomized
   controlled trial design.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThere is a dearth of research to support the treatment of
   people with postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS). Despite expert
   consensus suggesting exercise is recommended for this patient group,
   there are no randomised control trials examining this rigorously. The
   aim was to co-create a feasibility trial protocol and a rehabilitation
   intervention for people living with PoTS.MethodsThe intervention and
   feasibility trial design were co-created as part of the PostUraL
   tachycardia Syndrome Exercise (PULSE) study. We used the `three co's
   framework' of co-define, co-design and co-refine. Recruitment included
   key national charities and National Health Service Trusts treating
   people living with PoTS in the UK. Eighteen patient and public
   involvement members attended the co-define session, and 16 co-creators
   with a mix of expertise attended the subsequent co-design and co-refine
   sessions. Seven intervention practitioners were trained in the
   rehabilitation intervention, providing feedback for further
   co-refinement.ResultsThe final co-created intervention comprises online
   physical activity, and lifestyle and behaviour change support sessions.
   It is based on functional movement activities using a patient-centred
   approach tailored to individual needs. Physical activity intensity is
   guided by individuals' perception of effort rather than by objective
   measures. Recumbent bikes are provided for home use. Patients deemed
   randomisation to be acceptable because research in this area was
   considered important.ConclusionsAn innovative approach was used to
   co-create the PULSE intervention and feasibility trial protocol to meet
   the evidence-based and logistical needs of people living with PoTS,
   clinicians, service deliverers, third-sector organisations, academics
   and funders. This can be used as a successful example and template for
   future research internationally. People living with PoTS were recognised
   as experts and involved in every aspect of conceptualisation, design and
   refinement. This complex rehabilitation intervention is currently being
   tested in a randomised feasibility trial comparing the PULSE
   intervention with best-practice usual care for people living with PoTS.},

Title = {Harnessing education and lifestyle change to support transitional health
   for returning citizens: a feasibility study protocol},

Abstract = {BackgroundExercise and healthy eating are known to reduce chronic
   disease risk; however, formerly incarcerated individuals (i.e.,
   returning citizens) face significant social barriers when attempting to
   engage with existing community-based physical activity and nutrition
   programs. Given the high disease burden and unique educational needs of
   returning citizens, this proposed work fills an important gap in the
   support services currently offered to this population.MethodsThis
   article describes a process for evaluating the feasibility and
   acceptability of a physical activity and nutrition intervention tailored
   to the needs of returning citizens via a partnership between an academic
   research organization and a community-based reentry program for
   returning citizens. Staff from the community-based reentry program will
   train four returning citizens as group fitness instructors and work with
   a nutritionist to design a 16-week nutrition education curriculum.
   Reentry program staff will enroll up to 15 formerly incarcerated adults
   (aged 18 +) in the exercise and nutrition program. Participants will
   take part in weekly nutrition classes led by the nutritionist and weekly
   group exercise classes led by a peer instructor. Research staff will
   evaluate program success in four domains: reach, preliminary
   effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance.ResultsThis feasibility
   study will allow us to design and test a program that can eventually be
   evaluated in a large, randomized trial. It also addresses the multitude
   of social determinants that impact the health of returning citizens and
   builds a framework for program sustainability. Individuals recruited as
   fitness trainers will acquire skills and certifications that may be used
   to sustain physical fitness activities within the reentry
   program.ConclusionsThis feasibility study will test our ability to
   address social determinants that impact the health of returning citizens
   through a peer-led physical activity and nutrition programming. In the
   long term, study results may inform development and implementation of
   reentry programming and policy on a wider scale.},

Abstract = {BackgroundLaw enforcement frequently responds to substance abuse and
   mental health crises. Crisis stabilization units (CSUs) operate as a
   public-receiving facility to provide short-term stabilization services
   for individuals experiencing these crises and offer law enforcement an
   important alternative to arrest. However, there is limited understanding
   about how and when law enforcement decides to use CSUs. There is also
   the challenge of retaining individuals in treatment after CSU
   stabilization to prevent future crises and persistent engagement with
   police. This study will respond to these gaps by exploring CSU
   procedures and examining the feasibility and acceptability of a
   technology-assisted mobile aftercare intervention designed for
   individuals brought to a CSU by law enforcement.MethodsThis study will
   consist of three aims. Aim 1 will include qualitative interviews with
   law enforcement and CSU-affiliated mental health staff (n=80) regarding
   CSU utilization and collaboration logistics between the groups. Findings
   from Aim 1 will be synthesized for the development of an implementation
   guide of our intervention, mobile, and technology-assisted aftercare,
   designed for individuals brought to a CSU by law enforcement, during Aim
   2. During Aim 2, intervention services will be pilot-tested for 6 months
   through a small sample (n=24), randomized control trial (RCT). Control
   participants will receive standard services available for individuals
   discharging from a CSU. Treatment participants will receive the mobile
   aftercare intervention. Qualitative and quantitative data will be
   collected at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-recruitment for all
   study participants. Aims 1 and 2 will inform the design of a multi-site
   RCT to compare CSUs with and without mobile and technology-assisted
   aftercare (Aim 3).DiscussionThe study will offer decision making and
   procedural insight into law enforcement use of CSUs as an alternative to
   jail and provide opportunities to inform that process. This research
   will provide outcome trends for those who go through standard CSU
   services compared to those who receive mobile and technology-assisted
   aftercare services. The current study will inform a larger RCT efficacy
   study of CSUs with and without technology-assisted aftercare services.},

Abstract = {BackgroundExcessive gestational weight gain (EGWG), insufficient
   prenatal physical activity and sleep, and poor psychological wellbeing
   independently increase risks for adverse maternal and infant outcomes. A
   novel approach to mitigate these risks is utilizing peer support in a
   community-based prenatal intervention. This study assessed the
   feasibility (acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality) of
   a remotely delivered prenatal physical activity intervention called My
   Baby, My Move + (MBMM +) that aims to increase prenatal physical
   activity, enhance mood and sleep hygiene, and reduce
   EGWG.MethodsParticipants were recruited through community organizations,
   local clinics, and social media platforms in the Fall of 2020 and Spring
   of 2021. Eligible pregnant women were randomized to either the MBMM +
   intervention or the control group. Each group met over Zoom for 16
   sessions (twice weekly for 60 min over 8 weeks) to learn either
   behavioral change and wellbeing knowledge and skills (MBMM +) or
   knowledge and skills related to parenting (control group). Multiple
   methods of evaluation to better understand the feasibility of the
   intervention were conducted.ResultsA total of 49 women (25 MBMM +
   intervention, 24 control) completed both pre- and post-survey
   assessments and were included in the analyses. A subsample of 19 (39\%)
   intervention participants completed a combination of semi-structured
   interviews/surveys to assess acceptability, demand, implementation, and
   practicality. Participants expressed positive feedback regarding
   acceptability (satisfaction and intent to continue use) and were
   extremely likely or likely to recommend the program to a friend
   (demand). Implementation metrics were assessed by observation and
   feedback forms completed by peer leaders and demonstrated high-quality
   control. Findings suggest that the intervention was practical due to
   remote sessions and cost-effectiveness.ConclusionThe MBMM + intervention
   was deemed to be a feasible intervention with high acceptability,
   demand, implementation, and practicality. These findings can be used to
   inform the scalability of the intervention and implementation of a
   larger efficacy trial.},

Abstract = {IntroductionAdolescents who drop out of sport often report that it had
   become less `fun' and `enjoyable' over time. Although preadolescent
   sport typically emphasizes experiences of fun, emphases on competition
   and elite performance often dominate during adolescence. We theorized
   that adherence to adolescent sport might be improved if the overarching
   goal were to maximize repeated experiences of fun during sport and,
   subsequently, increase reflective evaluations of sport enjoyment. To
   that end, this manuscript reports on the rationale and design of the
   PlayFit Youth Sport Program (PYSP), as well as its preliminary
   feasibility and acceptability. The main objectives were to evaluate the
   feasibility of recruitment strategies and data collection procedures and
   the acceptability of the intervention.SettingAn outdoor, multipurpose
   grass field at a south-central Pennsylvania middle school.MethodsA
   mixed-methods, single-arm feasibility trial lasting for 8 weeks
   (August-October 2021) offered 3-times per week for 1-h per session. The
   equipment, ruleset, and psychosocial environment of the PYSP sport games
   were modified to reduce several of the constraints theorized to impair
   experiences of fun during sport and hamper reflective evaluations of
   enjoyment afterward. ResultsEleven healthy, but sedentary adolescents in
   grades 5-7 completed the program. The median number of sessions attended
   (of 16 possible) was 12 (range = 6-13). Post-intervention, 9/10
   respondents indicated that they `looked forward' to the PYSP, 8/10 would
   recommend it to a friend, and 8/10 were interested in continuing the
   program. Ten of 11 participant guardians expressed interest in
   reenrolling their children if the PYSP were offered again. Some changes
   recommended were to improve recruitment via advertising the positive
   aspects of the program and ``word of mouth{''} techniques, offering the
   program immediately following the school day, having contingencies for
   inclement weather, and minor changes to the sport equipment to improve
   the experience among the population the PYSP intends to
   attract.ConclusionsThe adjustments recommended in this preliminary work
   could be used to further refine the PYSP. A future efficacy trial could
   explore whether the PYSP may reduce attrition for adolescents who
   experience existing sport programs negatively by offering an alternative
   that better matches their unique needs and preferences.},

Title = {Accelerating the development of a psychological intervention to restore
   treatment decision-making capacity in patients with
   schizophrenia-spectrum disorder: a study protocol for a multi-site,
   assessor-blinded, pilot Umbrella trial (the DEC:IDES trial)},

Abstract = {Background A high proportion of patients diagnosed with
   schizophrenia-spectrum disorders will at some point in their lives be
   assessed as not having the capacity to make their own decisions about
   pharmacological treatment or inpatient care ('capacity'). Few will be
   helped to regain it before these interventions proceed. This is partly
   because effective and safe methods to do so are lacking. Our aim is to
   accelerate their development by testing, for the first time in mental
   healthcare, the feasibility, acceptability and safety of running an
   `Umbrella' trial. This involves running, concurrently and under one
   multi-site infrastructure, multiple assessor-blind randomised controlled
   trials, each of which is designed to examine the effect on capacity of
   improving a single psychological mechanism ('mechanism'). Our primary
   objectives are to demonstrate feasibility of (i) recruitment and (ii)
   data retention on the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Treatment
   (MacCAT-T; planned primary outcome for a future trial) at
   end-of-treatment. We selected three mechanisms to test: `self-stigma',
   low self-esteem and the `jumping to conclusions' bias. Each is highly
   prevalent in psychosis, responsive to psychological intervention, and
   hypothesised to contribute to impaired capacity.
   Methods Sixty participants with schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses,
   impaired capacity and one or more mechanism(s) will be recruited from
   outpatient and inpatient mental health services in three UK sites
   (Lothian, Scotland; Lancashire and Pennine; North West England). Those
   lacking capacity to consent to research could take part if the key
   criteria were met, including either proxy consent (Scotland) or
   favourable Consultee advice (England). They will be allocated to one of
   three randomised controlled trials, depending on which mechanism(s) they
   have. They will then be randomised to receive, over an 8-week period and
   in addition to treatment as usual (TAU), 6 sessions of either a
   psychological intervention which targets the mechanism, or 6 sessions of
   assessment of the causes of their incapacity (control condition).
   Participants are assessed at 0 (baseline), 8 (end-of-treatment) and 24
   (follow-up) weeks post-randomisation using measures of capacity
   (MacCAT-T), mechanism, adverse events, psychotic symptoms, subjective
   recovery, quality of life, service use, anxiety, core schemata and
   depression. Two nested qualitative studies will be conducted; one to
   understand participant and clinician experiences and one to investigate
   the validity of MacCAT-T appreciation ratings.
   Discussion This will be the first Umbrella trial in mental healthcare.
   It will produce the first 3 single-blind randomised controlled trials of
   psychological interventions to support treatment decision-making in
   schizophrenia-spectrum disorder. Demonstrating feasibility will have
   significant implications not only for those seeking to support capacity
   in psychosis, but also for those who wish to accelerate the development
   of psychological interventions for other conditions.},

Abstract = {BackgroundIn Ireland, the agriculture sector reports the highest number
   of fatalities even though farmers constitute only 6\% of the working
   population. Tractor-related behaviours are implicated in 55\% of all
   vehicle work-related fatalities and 25\% of reported injuries, and many
   of these occur in farmyards. There is limited research on the
   feasibility and acceptability of behaviour change interventions to
   improve tractor safety. Target behaviours that promote safe operation in
   farmyards, determining and addressing blind spots of tractors, were
   identified, and an intervention was developed following the Behaviour
   Change Wheel Approach. The objective of the study is to examine the
   feasibility, fidelity and acceptability of a behaviour change
   intervention to enhance the safe operation of tractors in farmyards with
   a particular focus on tractor blind spots.MethodA single group
   feasibility study will be undertaken. Approximately 16 farmers from four
   major farm types will be recruited for the study between August and
   September 2022. The intervention involves an in-person demo session,
   facilitated discussion and personalised safety training procedure with
   safety goals. The study will collect data from participants at three
   time points: baseline (3-10 days prior to the intervention), during the
   intervention and at the follow-up session (7-30 days post-intervention).
   Quantitative data will be collected through a pre-intervention interview
   and feedback surveys. A pre- and post-intervention qualitative interview
   will also be conducted with the participants and will be supplemented
   with qualitative data from recruitment logs, observational memos and
   logs and feedback from recruiters. Evaluation of the feasibility,
   acceptability and fidelity of the intervention will be guided by a
   pre-determined feasibility checklist, fidelity framework and theoretical
   framework of acceptability, respectively. Interviews will be analysed
   using the content analysis.DiscussionThe current study can determine the
   feasibility and fidelity of delivering a systematic, theoretically
   driven, tailored behaviour change intervention. It will also assess
   whether the intervention, its ingredients and delivery are acceptable to
   the farming population. This study will also inform the development of a
   future larger trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention.},

Abstract = {BackgroundEarly language difficulties are associated with poor school
   readiness and can impact lifelong attainment. The quality of the early
   home language environment is linked to language outcomes. However, few
   home-based language interventions have sufficient evidence of
   effectiveness in improving preschool children's language abilities. This
   study reports the first stage in the evaluation of a theory-based
   programme, Talking Together (developed and delivered by BHT Early
   Education and Training) given over 6 weeks to families in the home
   setting. We aimed to test the feasibility and acceptability of
   delivering Talking Together in the Better Start Bradford community prior
   to a definitive trial, using a two-armed randomised controlled
   feasibility study.MethodsFamilies from a single site within the Better
   Start Bradford reach area were randomly allocated (1:1) to the Talking
   Together intervention or a wait list control group. Child language and
   parent-level outcome measures were administered before randomisation
   (baseline), pre-intervention (pre-test), 2 months post-intervention
   start (post-test), and 6 months post-intervention start (follow-up).
   Routine monitoring data from families and practitioners were also
   collected for eligibility, consent, protocol adherence, and attrition
   rates. Descriptive statistics on the feasibility and reliability of
   potential outcome measures were analysed alongside qualitative feedback
   on trial design acceptability. Pre-defined progression-to-trial criteria
   using a traffic light system were assessed using routine monitoring
   data.ResultsTwo-hundred and twenty-two families were assessed for
   eligibility; of these, 164 were eligible. A total of 102 families
   consented and were randomised (intervention: 52, waitlist control: 50);
   68\% of families completed outcome measures at 6-month follow-up.
   Recruitment (eligibility and consent) reached `green' progression
   criteria; however, adherence reached `amber' and attrition reached `red'
   criteria. Child- and parent-level data were successfully measured, and
   the Oxford-CDI was identified as a suitable primary outcome measure for
   a definitive trial. Qualitative data not only indicated that the
   procedures were largely acceptable to practitioners and families but
   also identified areas for improvement in adherence and attrition
   rates.ConclusionsReferral rates indicate that Talking Together is a
   much-needed service and was positively received by the community. A full
   trial is feasible with adaptations to improve adherence and reduce
   attrition.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPost-stroke physical activity reduces disability and risk of
   further stroke. When stroke rehabilitation ends, some people feel
   abandoned by services and struggle to undertake physical activities that
   support recovery and health. The aim of this study was to codesign a
   novel text message intervention to promote physical activity among
   people with stroke and provide support when formal rehabilitation ends.
   This manuscript describes the intervention development processes that
   will inform future pilot and feasibility studies.MethodsThe planned
   intervention was a series of text messages to be sent in a predetermined
   sequence to people with stroke at the end of rehabilitation. The
   intervention, underpinned by behaviour change theory and using salient
   behaviour change techniques, would provide daily messages offering
   encouragement and support for the uptake and maintenance of physical
   activity following stroke. The intervention was codesigned by a
   Collaborative Working Group, comprised of people with stroke,
   rehabilitation therapists, representatives from stroke charities and
   academics. A four-step framework was used to design the intervention:
   formative research on physical activity post-stroke, creation of the
   behaviour change text message intervention, pre-testing and refinement.
   Formative research included a review of the scientific evidence and
   interviews with community-dwelling people with stroke. Data generated
   were used by the Collaborative Working Group to identify topics to be
   addressed in the intervention. These were mapped to constructs of the
   Health Action Process Approach, and salient behaviour change techniques
   to deliver the intervention were identified. The intervention was
   rendered into a series of text messages to be delivered over 12 weeks.
   The draft intervention was revised and refined through an iterative
   process including review by people with stroke, their spouses,
   rehabilitation therapists and experts in the field of stroke.The
   messages encourage regular physical activity but do not prescribe
   exercise or provide reminders to exercise at specific times. They use
   conversational language to encourage engagement, and some are
   personalised for participants. Quotes from people with stroke provide
   encouragement and support and model key behaviour change techniques such
   as goal setting and coping planning.DiscussionCo-design processes were
   critical in systematically developing this theory and evidence-based
   intervention. People with stroke and rehabilitation therapists provided
   insights into perceived barriers post-rehabilitation and identified
   strategies to overcome them. The structured multistep approach
   highlighted areas for improvement through successive rounds of review.
   The intervention will be tested for acceptability, feasibility and
   effectiveness in future studies. This co-design approach could be used
   for interventions for other heath behaviours and with different
   populations.},

Abstract = {BackgroundEvasive personality disorder (AvPD) and social phobia (SP)
   have substantial costs for patients and their families and great
   economic costs to the society. While psychotherapy can be an efficacious
   treatment, many patients drop out during treatment. Increased knowledge
   on how to decrease dropout from psychotherapy is warranted, including
   how to increase a patient's readiness for psychotherapy.MethodsWe
   describe a randomized controlled feasibility and superiority trial of 42
   individuals with a clinical diagnosis of either SP or AvPD, who are to
   initiate psychotherapeutic treatment in Danish outpatient mental health
   services. They will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either
   assessment-as-usual and receive no further assessment or to a Modified
   Collaborative Assessment (MCA) provided as a pre-treatment intervention
   before psychotherapy initiation. MCA will include a battery of
   psychological tests designed to thoroughly assess the patients'
   psychopathology. The tests are administered in collaboration with the
   patient, including detailed oral and written feedback. We hypothesize
   that the intervention is feasible regarding patient's acceptance and
   adherence. We further hypothesize that patients randomized to MCA will
   reach higher levels of readiness for psychotherapy as assessed with the
   University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale
   (URICA).DiscussionThis protocol assesses the feasibility, efficacy,
   acceptability, and safety of an intervention aimed at changing the
   readiness for participation in psychotherapy of patients with SP and
   AvPD. Results from this feasibility study could guide the development of
   future large-scale trials of MCA and procedures for MCA treatment
   fidelity assessment.},

Title = {Systematic braiding of Smoke-Free Home SafeCare to address child
   maltreatment risk and secondhand smoke exposure: findings from a pilot

Abstract = {Background Exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) and child
   maltreatment are preventable threats to child health. Few evidence-based
   interventions target both SHS and child maltreatment risk. The purpose
   of this paper is to describe the systematic braiding process of two
   evidence-based programs to address child SHS in the home and
   maltreatment perpetration risk, and present results from the formative
   work and pilot study.
   Methods The first 4 steps of the systematic braiding process were
   completed, including the following: (1) the identification of core
   elements of both programs, (2) the development of an initial draft of
   the braided curriculum (Smoke-Free Home SafeCare - SFH-SC), (3) an
   acceptability and feasibility pilot of SFH-SC with caregivers of young
   children who reported a smoker living in the home (N = 8), and (4)
   feedback collection on the braided curriculum from SafeCare Providers (N
   = 9).
   Results Experts identified common pedagogical and theoretical
   underpinnings for the two programs and braided Smoke-Free Homes: Some
   Things Are Better Outside into two SafeCare modules. Caregiver feedback
   from the pilot demonstrated that participants were engaged with SFH-SC
   and felt supported and comfortable discussing SHS intervention content
   with the SFH-SC Provider. Caregiver self-reports indicated a slight
   increase in smoke-free home rules from baseline to follow-up and a
   notable reduction in parent stress on the Parent Stress Index of 5.9
   points (SD = 10.2). SafeCare Provider feedback following intensive
   review of the curriculum indicated high feasibility for SFH-SC delivery.
   Conclusions Parent and Provider findings suggest SFH-SC is a viable
   intervention that has potential to reduce the public health impact of
   SHS and child maltreatment for at-risk families.},

Abstract = {BackgroundDespite effective treatments, one fifth of patients develop
   chronic depression. Music therapy may offer a different approach. This
   study aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability of a music therapy
   intervention and trial methodology.MethodsA parallel two-arm randomised
   controlled trial with wait-list control, mixed feasibility/acceptability
   measures and nested process evaluation. Adults with long-term depression
   (symptom duration > 1 year) were recruited from community mental health
   services and computer randomised to 42 sessions of group music therapy
   with songwriting three times per week or wait-list control. Depression,
   social functioning, distress, quality of life, satisfaction and service
   use were assessed by blinded researchers at enrolment, 1 week and 3 and
   6 months post-therapy. Outcomes were analysed descriptively, controlling
   for baseline covariates. Recruitment (number eligible, participation and
   retention rates) and intervention (fidelity, adherence) feasibility were
   assessed using pre-defined stop-go criteria. Attendance, adverse events,
   mood, relationship satisfaction and semi-structured interviews were
   analysed in a nested process evaluation.ResultsRecruitment processes
   were feasible with 421 eligible, 12.7\% participation and 60\% (18/30)
   retention. Thirty participants were randomised to intervention (N = 20)
   and control (N = 10). Session attendance was low (mean 10.5) with four
   withdrawals. Music therapist adherence was good but changes to session
   frequency were suggested. Outcomes were available for 10/20 treatment
   and 9/10 wait-list participants. Depression increased in both arms
   post-therapy. Treatment depression scores fell below baseline 3 and 6
   months post-therapy indicating improvement. Wait-list depression scores
   increased from baseline 3 and 6 months post-therapy. At 3 months, the
   treatment arm improved from baseline on all measures except satisfaction
   and functioning. At 6 months, quality of life, distress and functioning
   improved with reduction in health service contacts. High-attending
   participants improved more than low-attending. Seven adverse events (one
   serious) were reported.LimitationsAs this was a feasibility study,
   clinical outcomes should be interpreted cautiously.ConclusionA
   randomised controlled trial of group music therapy using songwriting is
   feasible with inclusion criteria and session frequency modifications,
   but further intervention development is required.},

Title = {Evaluating an emotion coaching programme for parents of young
   adolescents attending Child Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in
   New Zealand: protocol for a multi-site feasibility trial including
   co-design with service users},

Abstract = {BackgroundEarly adolescence is a time of increased vulnerability for the
   development of common mental health conditions such as anxiety and
   depression (internalising outcomes). Current treatments such as
   cognitive-behavioural therapy and antidepressant medication are focused
   on the individual and have small effect sizes, particularly in
   real-world clinical settings such as the public Child Adolescent Mental
   Health Services (CAMHS). Parents are an important and under-utilised
   resource in treating these conditions in young adolescents. Teaching
   parents how to respond to their young person's emotions can improve
   emotion regulation and reduce internalising outcomes. One
   emotion-focused programme for parents of this age group is Tuning in to
   Teens (TINT). This is a structured, manualised skills group for parents
   only focused on teaching skills to coach young people through their
   emotional experiences. This study aims to investigate the impact of TINT
   in the clinical setting of publicly funded CAMHS in New
   Zealand.MethodsThe trial will evaluate the feasibility of a two-arm
   multi-site randomised control trial (RCT). Participants will be
   10-14-year-olds referred to CAMHS in Wellington, New Zealand, with
   anxiety or depression, and their parents or guardians. Arm 1 will be
   parents attending and implementing TINT (in addition to the usual care
   received at CAMHS). Arm 2 will be usual care only. TINT groups will be
   facilitated by CAMHS clinicians who have been trained in the programme
   and will be delivered over 8 weekly sessions. Prior to the RCT, a
   co-design methodology will be used with service users to inform outcome
   measures used in the trial. A group of service users meeting the RCT
   criteria will be recruited to take part in workshops to help determine
   their priority outcomes. Measures based on the results of workshops will
   be included in the outcome measures. The primary feasibility outcomes
   will be the recruitment and retention of participants, acceptability of
   the intervention for service users and clinicians and acceptability of
   outcome measures.DiscussionThere is a need to improve outcomes for the
   treatment of adolescent anxiety and depression. TINT is a programme with
   the potential to enhance outcomes for those accessing mental health
   services by providing targeted support to parents of adolescents. This
   trial will inform whether a full RCT is feasible to evaluate TINT.
   Including service users in the design will increase its relevance of an
   evaluation in this setting.},

Abstract = {Background The use of psychoactive substances significantly impacts the
   health, social and economic aspects of families, communities and
   nations. There is a need to develop and test psychological interventions
   aimed for individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) in lower- and
   middle-income countries (LMICs), such as in Pakistan. The aim of this
   exploratory trial is to test the feasibility and acceptability of two
   culturally adapted psychological interventions in a factorial randomised
   controlled trial (RCT).Methods The proposed project will be conducted in
   three phases. The first phase of the study will focus on cultural
   adaptation of the interventions through qualitative interviews with key
   stakeholders. The second phase will be to refine and produce manually
   assisted interventions. Third and last stage would be to assess the
   feasibility of the culturally adapted interventions through a factorial
   RCT. The study will be carried out in Karachi, Hyderabad, Peshawar,
   Lahore and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Recruitment of participants will take
   place from primary care and volunteer organisations/drug rehabilitation
   centres. A total of 260 individuals diagnosed with SUD (n = 65) in each
   of the four arms will be recruited. The intervention will be delivered
   weekly over a period of 12 weeks in both individual and group settings.
   Assessments will be carried out at baseline, at 12th week (after
   completion of intervention) and 24th week post-randomisation. The
   analysis will determine the feasibility of recruitment, randomisation,
   retention and intervention delivery. Acceptability of intervention will
   be determined in terms of adherence to intervention, i.e. the mean
   number of sessions attended, number of home assignments completed,
   attrition rates, as well as through process evaluation to understand the
   implementation process, context, participants' satisfaction, and impact
   of the study intervention. The health resource use and impact on the
   quality of life will be established through health economic
   data.Discussion This study will provide evidence for feasibility and
   acceptability of culturally adapted manually assisted psychological
   interventions for individuals with SUD in the context of Pakistan. The
   study will have clinical implications if intervention is proven feasible
   and acceptable.},

Abstract = {Background Among older adults, food insecurity is associated with poor
   health status and health outcomes; people living with dementia (PLWD)
   are at increased risk for insecurity. Approaches to addressing food
   insecurity among homebound older adults include two modes of
   home-delivered meals: (1) meals delivered daily to participants' homes
   by a volunteer or paid driver who socializes with the client or (2)
   frozen meals that are mailed to participants' homes. Research has not
   examined benefits of these meals for PLWD or their caregivers nor
   compared the effectiveness of these two approaches in reducing food
   insecurity. The objective of this study was to test the processes for
   recruiting and engaging in qualitative research with PLWD and caregivers
   in an effort to understand the context, implementation, and mechanisms
   of impact by which relationships between meal delivery and outcomes may
   be achieved in preparation for a larger, follow-on study.
   Methods This is a qualitative sub-study of a pilot, multisite, two-arm
   pragmatic feasibility trial comparing the effect of two modes of meal
   delivery on nursing home placement among 243 PLWD. In this sub-study, we
   tested recruitment and enrollment procedures and piloted interview
   guides among a subset of participants and caregivers.
   Results We recruited and conducted interviews with nine PLWD and seven
   caregivers. In testing the informed consent process, all participants
   were able to consent to be interviewed, and PLWD all demonstrated
   capacity to consent. We successfully used a cognitive screener to obtain
   scores of cognitive impairment for PLWD and observed scores indicating a
   broad range of function. Our interview guides successfully resulted in
   information about the context, implementation, and mechanisms of impact
   for meal delivery during the pilot.
   Conclusions In addition to establishing feasibility for the future
   trial, the substantive findings identified through the qualitative
   interviews provide an initial understanding of the contextual factors
   for meal delivery and the potential mechanisms of impact across meal
   delivery types that warrant further examination in a full-scale trial.
   Findings from our study provide crucial pilot data to support a
   follow-on trial to understand how to address food insecurity among PLWD.},

Abstract = {BackgroundMental illnesses comprise the single largest source of
   health-related economic burden globally, and low- and middle-income
   countries are disproportionately affected. The majority of people with
   schizophrenia who need treatment do not receive it and are often wholly
   reliant on family caregivers for daily care and support. Family
   interventions have an exceptionally robust evidence base for their
   efficacy in high-resource settings, but it is unknown whether they can
   produce equivalent effects in some low-resource settings where cultural
   beliefs, explanatory models of illness and contextual socio-economic
   issues differ.MethodsThis protocol describes the methods for a
   randomised controlled trial to determine the feasibility of testing
   culturally adapt and refine an evidence-based, family intervention for
   relatives and caregivers of people with schizophrenia in Indonesia. The
   feasibility and acceptability of implementing our adapted, co-produced
   intervention via task shifting in primary care settings will be
   evaluated using the Medical Research Council framework for complex
   interventions. We will recruit 60 carer-service-user dyads and randomise
   them in a 1:1 ratio either to receive our manualised intervention or
   continue to receive treatment as usual. Healthcare workers in primary
   care settings will be trained to deliver family interventions using our
   manualised intervention by a family intervention specialist.
   Participants will complete the ECI, IEQ, KAST and GHQ. Service-user
   symptom level and relapse status will be measured using the PANSS at
   baseline, post-intervention and 3 months later by trained researchers.
   Fidelity to the intervention model will be measured using the FIPAS.
   Qualitative evaluation will further assist with refining the
   intervention, evaluating trial processes and evaluating
   acceptability.DiscussionNational healthcare policy in Indonesia supports
   the delivery of mental health services in a complex network of primary
   care centres. This study will provide important information on the
   feasibility of delivering family interventions for people with
   schizophrenia via task shifting in primary care settings in Indonesia
   and allow further refinement of the intervention and trial processes.},

Title = {Designing a generic, adaptive protocol resource for the measurement of
   health impact in cash transfer pilot and feasibility studies and trials
   in high-income countries},

Abstract = {IntroductionIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, upstream
   interventions that tackle social determinants of health inequalities
   have never been more important. Evaluations of upstream cash transfer
   trials have failed to capture comprehensively the impacts that such
   systems might have on population health through inadequate design of the
   interventions themselves and failure to implement consistent, thorough
   research measures that can be used in microsimulations to model
   long-term impact. In this article, we describe the process of developing
   a generic, adaptive protocol resource to address this issue and the
   challenges involved in that process. The resource is designed for use in
   high-income countries (HIC) but draws on examples from a UK context to
   illustrate means of development and deployment. The resource is capable
   of further adaptation for use in low- and middle-income countries
   (LMIC). It has particular application for trials of Universal Basic
   Income but can be adapted to those covering other kinds of cash transfer
   and welfare system changes.MethodsWe outline two types of prospective
   intervention based on pilots and trials currently under discussion. In
   developing the remainder of the resource, we establish six key
   principles, implement a modular approach based on types of measure and
   their prospective resource intensity, and source (validated where
   possible) measures and baseline data primarily from routine collection
   and large, longitudinal cohort studies. Through these measures, we seek
   to cover all areas of health impact identified in our theoretical model
   for use in pilot and feasibility studies.ResultsWe find that, in
   general, self-reported measures alongside routinely collected linked
   respondent data may provide a feasible means of producing data capable
   of demonstrating comprehensive health impact. However, we also suggest
   that, where possible, physiological measures should be included to
   elucidate underlying biological effects that may not be accurately
   captured through self-reporting alone and can enable modelling of
   long-term health outcomes. In addition, accurate self-reported objective
   income data remains a challenge and requires further development and
   testing. A process of development and implementation of the resource in
   pilot and feasibility studies will support assessment of whether or not
   our proposed health outcome measures are acceptable, feasible and can be
   used with validity and reliability in the target population.DiscussionWe
   suggest that while Open Access evaluation instruments are available and
   usable to measure most constructs of interest, there remain some areas
   for which further development is necessary. This includes self-reported
   wellbeing measures that require paid licences but are used in a range of
   nationally important longitudinal studies instead of Open Access
   alternatives.},

Abstract = {Background People with intellectual disabilities (ID) experience high
   rates of lifestyle related morbidities, in part due to lack of access to
   tailored health promotion programmes. This study aimed to assess the
   feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a tailored healthy lifestyle
   intervention, Get Healthy! Methods Get Healthy! is a 12-week physical
   activity and healthy eating programme designed to address
   lifestyle-related risks for adults with mild-moderate ID. The
   feasibility pilot was designed to assess subjective participant
   experience and programme feasibility across: recruitment and screening,
   retention, session attendance and engagement, adverse events, and
   practicality and reliability of outcome procedures. Exploratory
   programme efficacy was assessed across the following measures:
   anthropometry (body mass index, weight, waist circumference),
   cardiovascular fitness, physical strength, dietary intake, healthy
   literacy, and quality of life.
   Results Six participants with moderate ID and two carer participants
   completed the feasibility trial, representing a 100\% retention rate.
   Qualitative data indicated the programme was well received. Participants
   with ID attended 75\% of sessions offered and displayed a high level of
   engagement in sessions attended (91\% mean engagement score). While most
   data collection procedures were feasible to implement, several measures
   were either not feasible for our participants, or required a higher
   level of support to implement than was provided in the existing trial
   protocol. Participants with ID displayed decreases in mean waist
   circumference between baseline and endpoint (95\% CI: - 3.20, - 0.17 cm)
   and some improvements in measures of cardiovascular fitness and physical
   strength. No changes in weight, body mass index, or objectively measured
   knowledge of nutrition and exercise or quality of life were detected
   from baseline to programme endpoint. Dietary intake results were mixed.
   Discussion The Get Healthy! programme was feasible to implement and well
   received by participants with moderate ID and their carers. Exploratory
   efficacy data indicates the programme has potential to positively impact
   important cardiometabolic risk factors such as waist circumference,
   cardiovascular fitness, and physical strength. Several of the proposed
   data collection instruments will require modification or replacement
   prior to use in a sufficiently powered efficacy trial.},

Abstract = {Background Many people do not regularly participate in physical
   activity, which may negatively impact their health. Current physical
   activity guidelines are focused on promoting weekly accumulation of at
   least 150 min of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity
   (MVPA). Whilst revised guidance now recognises the importance of making
   small changes to physical activity behaviour, guidance still focuses on
   adults needing to achieve at least 150 min of MVPA per week. An
   alternative `whole day' approach that could motivate the public to be
   more physically active, is a concept called Snacktivity (TM). Instead of
   focusing on achieving 150 min per week of physical activity, for example
   30 min of MVPA over 5 days, Snacktivity (TM) encourages the public to
   achieve this through small, but frequent, 2-5 min `snacks' of MVPA
   throughout the whole day.
   Methods The primary aim is to undertake a feasibility trial with nested
   qualitative interviews to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
   the Snacktivity (TM) intervention to inform the design of a subsequent
   phase III randomised trial. A two-arm randomised controlled feasibility
   trial aiming to recruit 80 inactive adults will be conducted.
   Recruitment will be from health and community settings and social media.
   Participants will be individually randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive
   either the Snacktivity (TM) intervention or usual care. The intervention
   will last 12 weeks with assessment of outcomes completed before and
   after the intervention in all participants. We are interested in whether
   the Snacktivity (TM) trial is appealing to participants (assessed by the
   recruitment rate) and if the Snacktivity (TM) intervention and trial
   methods are acceptable to participants (assessed by Snacktivity
   (TM)/physical activity adherence and retention rates). The intervention
   will be delivered by health care providers within health care
   consultations or by researchers. Participants' experiences of the trial
   and intervention, and health care providers' views of delivering the
   intervention within health consultations will be explored.
   Discussion The development of physical activity interventions that can
   be delivered at scale are needed. The findings from this study will
   inform the viability and design of a phase III trial to assess the
   effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Snacktivity (TM) to increase
   physical activity.},

Abstract = {Background Drastic increases in the rates of maternal depression and
   anxiety have been reported since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Most
   programs aim to improve maternal mental health or parenting skills
   separately, despite it being more effective to target both concurrently.
   The Building Emotional Awareness and Mental health (BEAM) program was
   developed to address this gap. BEAM is a mobile health program aiming to
   mitigate the impacts of pandemic stress on family well-being. Since many
   family agencies lack infrastructure and personnel to adequately treat
   maternal mental health concerns, a partnership will occur with Family
   Dynamics (a local family agency) to address this unmet need. The study's
   objective is to examine the feasibility of the BEAM program when
   delivered with a community partner to inform a larger randomized
   controlled trial (RCT). Methods A pilot RCT will be conducted with
   mothers who have depression and/or anxiety with a child 6-18 months old
   living in Manitoba, Canada. Mothers will be randomized to the 10 weeks
   of the BEAM program or a standard of care (i.e., MoodMission). Back-end
   App data (collected via Google Analytics and Firebase) will be used to
   examine feasibility, engagement, and accessibility of the BEAM program;
   cost-effectiveness will also be examined. Implementation elements (e.g.,
   maternal depression {[}Patient Health Questionnaire-9] and anxiety
   {[}Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7]) will be piloted to estimate the
   effect size and variance for future sample size calculations. Discussion
   In partnership with a local family agency, BEAM holds the potential to
   promote maternal-child health via a cost-effective and an easily
   accessible program designed to scale. Results will provide insight into
   the feasibility of the BEAM program and will inform future RCTs.},

Abstract = {BackgroundImpairment of arm movement occurs in up to 85\% of people
   post-stroke, affecting daily living activities, and quality of life.
   Mental imagery effectively enhances hand and daily function in people
   with stroke. Imagery can be performed when people imagine themselves
   completing the movement or imagine another person doing it. However,
   there is no report on the specific use of first-person and third-person
   imagery in stroke rehabilitation.AimsTo develop and assess the
   feasibility of the First-Person Mental Imagery (FPMI) and the
   Third-Person Mental Imagery (TPMI) programs to address the hand function
   of people with stroke living in the community.MethodsThis study
   comprises phase 1-development of the FPMI and TPMI programs, and phase
   2-pilot-testing of the intervention programs. The two programs were
   developed from existing literature and reviewed by an expert panel. Six
   participants with stroke, living in the community, participated in the
   pilot-testing of the FPMI and TPMI programs for 2 weeks. Feedback
   collected included the suitability of the eligibility criteria,
   therapist's and participant's adherence to intervention and
   instructions, appropriateness of the outcome measures, and completion of
   the intervention sessions within the specified time.ResultsThe FPMI and
   TPMI programs were developed based on previously established programs
   and included 12 hand tasks. The participants completed four 45-min
   sessions in 2 weeks. The treating therapist adhered to the program
   protocol and completed all the steps within the specified time frame.
   All hand tasks were suitable for adults with stroke. Participants
   followed the instructions given and engaged in imagery. The outcome
   measures selected were appropriate for the participants. Both programs
   showed a positive trend towards improvement in participants' upper
   extremity and hand function and self-perceived performance in activities
   of daily living.ConclusionsThe study provides preliminary evidence that
   these programs and outcome measures are feasible for implementation with
   adults with stroke living in the community. This study outlines a
   realistic plan for future trials in relation to participant recruitment,
   training of therapists on the intervention delivery, and the use of
   outcome measures.},

Abstract = {Background Exercise therapy is safe and effective in people with single
   conditions, but the feasibility in people with two or more conditions is
   unclear. Therefore, the aim was to evaluate the feasibility of exercise
   therapy and self-management in people with multimorbidity prior to a
   randomised, controlled trial (RCT).Methods This was a mixed-methods
   feasibility study performed in two general hospitals and one psychiatric
   hospital. 20 adult patients (8 females; mean age (SD) 67 (6.9)) with at
   least two long-term conditions and a score of >= 3 on Disease Burden
   Impact Scale for at least one condition (at least moderate limitations
   of daily activities) and of >= 2 for at least one other condition.
   Patients with unstable health conditions, at risk of serious adverse
   events (SAE) or with terminal conditions were excluded. Participants
   received 12 weeks of exercise (18 60-min group-based and 6 home-based
   sessions) and self-management support (6 90-min group-based sessions)
   supervised by physiotherapists. Pre-defined progression to RCT criteria
   were the primary outcomes and included recruitment rate (acceptable 20
   participants in 3 months), retention through follow-up (75\% retention),
   compliance (75\% complete > 9 of exercise and > 3 self-management
   sessions), outcome burden (80\% do not find outcomes too burdensome),
   improvement in quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) and function (6-min walk test;
   >= 50\% experience clinically relevant improvements) and
   intervention-related SAEs (No SAEs). Furthermore, a purposeful sample
   including eleven participants and two facilitators were interviewed
   about their experiences of participating/facilitating. Qualitative data
   was analysed using thematic analysis.Results Recruitment rate (20 in 49
   days), retention (85\%), outcome burden (95\%), and SAEs (0 related to
   intervention) were acceptable, while compliance (70\%) and improvements
   (35\% in quality of life, 46\% in function) were not (amendment needed
   before proceeding to RCT). The intervention was found acceptable by both
   participants and physiotherapists with some barriers among participants
   relating to managing multiple chronic conditions while caring for others
   or maintaining a job. Physiotherapists expressed a need for additional
   training.Conclusions Exercise therapy and self-management are feasible
   in people with multimorbidity. The subsequent RCT, amending the
   intervention according to progression criteria and feedback, will
   determine whether the intervention is superior to usual care alone.},

Abstract = {BackgroundEvidence for benefits of physical activity after stroke is
   unequivocal. However, many people with stroke are inactive, spending >
   80\% of waking hours sedentary even when they have physical capacity for
   activity, indicating barriers to physical activity participation that
   are not physical. WeWalk is a 12-week person-centred dyadic behaviour
   change intervention in which a person with stroke (PWS) and a walking
   buddy form a dyad to work together to support the PWS to increase their
   physical activity by walking outdoors. This pilot study examined the
   feasibility of recruiting dyads, explored their perceptions of
   acceptability and their experiences using WeWalk, to identify required
   refinements before progression to a clinical trial.MethodsDesign: A
   single-arm observational pilot study with qualitative
   evaluation.Intervention: WeWalk involved facilitated face-to-face and
   telephone sessions with a researcher who was also a behaviour change
   practitioner, supported by intervention handbooks and diaries, in which
   dyads agreed walking goals and plans, monitored progress, and developed
   strategies for maintaining walking.Evaluation: Descriptive data on
   recruitment and retention were collected. Interview data were collected
   through semi-structured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis,
   guided by a theoretical framework of acceptability.ResultsWe recruited
   21 dyads comprising community dwelling PWS and their walking buddies.
   Ten dyads fully completed WeWalk before government-imposed COVID-19
   lockdown. Despite lockdown, 18 dyads completed exit interviews. We
   identified three themes: acceptability evolves with experience,
   mutuality, and person-centredness with personally relevant tailoring. As
   dyads recognised how WeWalk components supported walking, perceptions of
   acceptability grew. Effort receded as goals and enjoyment of walking
   together were realised. The dyadic structure provided accountability,
   and participants' confidence developed as they experienced physical and
   psychological benefits of walking. WeWalk worked best when dyads
   exhibited relational connectivity and mutuality in setting and achieving
   goals. Tailoring intervention components to individual circumstances and
   values supported dyads in participation and achieving meaningful
   goals.ConclusionRecruiting dyads was feasible and most engaged with
   WeWalk. Participants viewed the dyadic structure and intervention
   components as acceptable for promoting outdoor walking and valued the
   personally tailored nature of WeWalk. Developing buddy support skills
   and community delivery pathways are required refinements. ISCTRN number:

Title = {A personhood and citizenship training workshop for care home staff to
   potentially increase wellbeing of residents with dementia: intervention
   development and feasibility testing of a cluster randomised controlled
   trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background In the UK, one third of people with dementia live in
   residential care homes, a sector where high staff turnover negatively
   affects continuity of care. To examine the effect of including
   personhood and citizenship principles in training, interventions need to
   be robustly tested, with outcomes relevant to residents with dementia.
   Methods Phase one intervention development: The training intervention
   (PERSONABLE) comprised five reflective exercises facilitated by a mental
   health nurse/researcher. PERSONABLE was informed by four focus groups,
   and one field exercise, consisting of care home staff and family
   members. Phase two feasibility testing: Participants were (i) care home
   residents with dementia and (ii) care home staff working in any role.
   After baseline measurements, care homes were randomly allocated to (i)
   staff receiving PERSONABLE training or (ii) training as usual.
   Feasibility outcomes were the recruitment and attrition of care homes,
   residents and staff members (measured ten weeks between randomisation
   and follow-up), the acceptability of the training intervention
   PERSONABLE, and acceptability of outcome measures. The care home
   environment was evaluated, at baseline, using the Therapeutic
   Environment Screening Survey for Residential Care Homes. Measurements
   conducted at baseline and follow-up were resident wellbeing (Dementia
   Care Mapping (TM)), staff knowledge of and confidence with personhood
   and citizenship (Personhood in Dementia Questionnaire and a perceived
   ability to care visual analogue scale). Inter-rater agreement for
   Dementia Care Mapping (TM) was undertaken at follow-up in one
   intervention and one training as a usual care home. Results Phase one:
   The developed reflective approach to the PERSONABLE exercises appeared
   to give staff a holistic understanding of residents living with
   dementia, seeing them as autonomous people rather than reductively as
   persons with a condition. Phase two: Six care homes, 40 residents and
   118 staff were recruited. Four residents were lost to follow-up.
   Twenty-nine staff in the PERSONABLE arm of the study received the
   training intervention. In the PERSONABLE arm, 26 staff completed both
   baseline and follow-up measurements compared to 21 in the training as
   the usual arm. The most common reason for the loss to follow-up of staff
   was leaving employment. For the outcome measure Dementia Care Mapping
   (TM), the proportion of overall agreement between the two observers was
   18.6\%. High attrition of staff occurred in those homes undergoing
   leadership changes. Conclusion With the right approach, it is possible
   to achieve good engagement during trial recruitment and intervention
   delivery of care home managers, staff and residents. Organisational
   changes are a less controllable aspect of trials but having a visible
   researcher presence during data collection helps to capitalise the
   engagement of those staff remaining in employment. Tailored, brief and
   flexible training interventions encourage staff participation.
   Simplification of study methods helps promote and retain sufficient
   staff in a definitive randomised controlled trial. This study found that
   some components of Dementia Care Mapping (TM) work effectively as an
   outcome measure. However, inter-rater reliability was poor, and the
   practical implementation of the measurement would need a great deal of
   further refinement to accurately capture the effect of a training
   intervention if delivered across a large number of clusters.
   The Dementia Care Mapping (TM) measurement fidelity issue would be
   further complicated if using multiple different unacquainted observers.},

Title = {The ``Family Health = Family Wealth{''} intervention: study protocol for
   a pilot quasi-experimental controlled trial of a multi-level,

Abstract = {Background: Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates globally, but
   only 30\% of women report using an effective method of contraception.
   Community-based, multi-level interventions are needed to help couples in
   rural Uganda overcome barriers to contraceptive use.Methods: This study
   will pilot test the Family Health = Family Wealth intervention, a
   multi-level, community-based intervention employing transformative
   community dialogues, which use facilitated discussion to reshape
   community norms that influence family planning acceptance, to alter
   individual attitudes and the perception of community norms that
   discourage family planning. Community dialogues are delivered to groups
   of couples over 4 sessions (two gender-segregated and two gender-mixed).
   Sessions simultaneously address individual and interpersonal-level
   determinants of family planning and link couples to family planning
   services. At the health system level, a refresher training will be
   conducted with health workers in the intervention community's health
   center to address gaps in contraceptive knowledge and skills as
   identified from a needs assessment.The intervention will be evaluated
   through a pilot quasi-experimental trial paired with a mixed methods
   process evaluation. Participants include 70 couples (N=140) randomized
   by community to the Family Health = Family Wealth intervention (n=35
   couples) or to an attention-matched water, sanitation, and hygiene
   (WASH) intervention (n=35 couples). Participants include sexually
   active, married couples who are age 18 (or an emancipated minor) to 40
   for women and age 18 (or an emancipated minor) to 50 for men, not
   pregnant, at least one person in the couple reports wanting to avoid
   pregnancy for at least a year, and not currently using a method of
   contraception or using a low-efficacy or ineffective method of
   contraception. The primary aims of the study are to (1) assess the
   feasibility of the intervention trial procedures, (2) the acceptability
   and feasibility of the intervention content and structure, and (3)
   explore the intervention's preliminary effectiveness at increasing
   contraceptive use and affecting related outcomes among
   couples.Discussion: Filling the unmet need for family planning has
   important public health implications, including reductions in
   pregnancy-related health risks and deaths, and infant mortality. This
   pilot intervention trial will gather preliminary evidence on the
   acceptability, feasibility, and potential effect of a novel,
   multi-level, community-based intervention to increase contraceptive use
   among couples with an unmet need for family planning in rural Uganda. We
   aim to use the findings of this pilot study to refine the trial
   procedures and intervention content for a future, larger cluster
   randomized controlled trial to establish the intervention's efficacy.},

Abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity and unhealthy dietary habits are known
   to be disadvantageous for the development of late adverse effects in
   survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer. To make
   interventions, aimed at improving lifestyle, fit into the daily life of
   survivors, interventions should be designed and delivered in a
   person-centred way with a limited time burden. As part of the European
   PanCareFollowUp project, an eHealth intervention was developed to
   support sustainable changes to physical activity levels and/or diet of
   childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer survivors. This
   feasibility study aims to gain insight into the feasibility and
   potential effect sizes of the PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention.
   Methods: The PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention consists of
   person-centred 3-6 screen-to-screen sessions with a certified lifestyle
   coach. The intervention will be evaluated with a single-arm pre-post
   feasibility study conducted at two survivorship care clinics in the
   Netherlands. A total of 60 participants who are (i) diagnosed with
   cancer < 25 years, (ii) \& GE; 5 years post-treatment, (iii) aged 16-55
   years, and (iv) have a low physical activity level and/or unhealthy
   dietary intake manifested by overweight will be recruited. Using
   reports, hospital records, and questionnaires for survivors, coaches,
   and late effect doctors, feasibility will be based on (i) adherence to
   intervention, (ii) acceptability, (iii) practicality, (iv)
   integration/implementation, (v) demand, and (vi) attrition. The
   potential effect sizes of the intervention will be explored by
   determining the percentage of survivors that reach the personalized
   lifestyle goals that were set with the coach. Physical activity level,
   dietary intake, BMI, general self-efficacy, self-management, and
   motivation level will be assessed at three time points with
   questionnaires, reports, and/or an accelerometer. Discussion: Data of
   this study will be gathered to assess the feasibility and potential
   effect sizes. This will allow for further intervention refinement as
   needed as well as to inform a future large-scale intervention study and
   a manual for implementation at other centres.},

Title = {Training for mental health professionals in responding to experienced

Abstract = {Background: Mental health and other health professionals working in
   mental health care may contribute to the experiences of stigma and
   discrimination among mental health service users but can also help
   reduce the impact of stigma on service users. However, few studies of
   interventions to equip such professionals to be anti-stigma agents took
   place in high-income countries. This study assesses the feasibility,
   potential effectiveness and costs of Responding to Experienced and
   Anticipated Discrimination training for health professionals working in
   mental health care (READ-MH) across low- and middle-income countries
   (LMICs). Methods: This is an uncontrolled pre-post mixed methods
   feasibility study of READ-MH training at seven sites across five LMICs
   (China, Ethiopia, India, Nepal and Tunisia). Outcome measures: knowledge
   based on course content, attitudes to working to address the impact of
   stigma on service users and skills in responding constructively to
   service users' reports of discrimination. The training draws upon the
   evidence bases for stigma reduction, health advocacy and medical
   education and is tailored to sites through situational analyses. Its
   content, delivery methods and intensity were agreed upon through a
   consensus exercise with site research teams. READ-MH will be delivered
   to health professionals working in mental health care immediately after
   baseline data collection; outcome measures will be collected
   post-training and 3 months post-baseline, followed by qualitative data
   collection analysed using a combined deductive and inductive approach.
   Fidelity will be rated during the delivery of READ-MH, and data on
   training costs will be collected. Quantitative data will be assessed
   using generalised linear mixed models. Qualitative data will be
   evaluated by thematic analysis to identify feedback about the training
   methods and content, including the implementability of the knowledge and
   skills learned. Pooled and site-specific training costs per trainee and
   per session will be reported. Conclusions: The training development used
   a participatory and contextualised approach. Evaluation design strengths
   include the diversity of settings, the use of mixed methods, the use of
   a skills-based measure and the knowledge and attitude measures aligned
   to the target population and training. Limitations are the uncertain
   generalisability of skills performance to routine care and the impact of
   COVID-19 restrictions at several sites limiting qualitative data
   collection for situational analyses.},

Abstract = {Background To our knowledge, there is no intervention which includes
   personalised exercise therapy and self-management support for people
   with multimorbidity, although these interventions may be as effective as
   for people with single chronic conditions. Therefore, we developed a
   novel intervention, including personalised exercise therapy and
   self-management support for people with multimorbidity. Methods We
   followed the Medical Research Council framework and conducted one
   scoping review, five systematic reviews, two registry-based studies, one
   qualitative interview study and a mixed-methods feasibility study.
   Following an iterative approach, together with feedback from people with
   multimorbidity and relevant stakeholders, we developed the MOBILIZE
   intervention. Results The intervention included 24 (60 minutes) sessions
   of personalised exercise therapy and 24 (30 minutes) sessions of
   self-management support twice a week for 12 weeks, delivered in small
   groups by specifically trained physiotherapists. The intervention
   targets physiological, psychosocial, behavioural, and contextual factors
   to improve health-related quality of life and physical function in
   people living with multimorbidity. Conclusions We developed a
   personalised exercise therapy and self-management support programme for
   people with multimorbidity. The intervention will be tested for its
   safety and effectiveness in a randomised controlled trial.},

Abstract = {Background Despite growing numbers of studies reporting the efficacy of
   complex interventions and their implementation, many studies fail to
   report information on implementation fidelity or describe how fidelity
   measures used within the study were developed. This study aimed to
   develop a fidelity checklist for measuring the implementation fidelity
   of an early, stroke-specialist vocational rehabilitation intervention
   (ESSVR) in the RETAKE trial. Methods To develop the fidelity measure,
   previous checklists were reviewed to inform the assessment structure,
   and core intervention components were extracted from intervention
   descriptions into a checklist, which was ratified by eight experts in
   fidelity measurement and complex interventions. Guidance notes were
   generated to assist with checklist completion. To test the measure, two
   researchers independently applied the checklist to fifteen stroke
   survivor intervention case notes using retrospective observational case
   review. The scoring was assessed for interrater reliability. Results A
   fidelity checklist containing 21 core components and 6 desirable
   components across 4 stages of intervention delivery was developed with
   corresponding guidance notes. Interrater reliability of each checklist
   item ranged from moderate to perfect (Cohen's kappa 0.69-1). Conclusions
   The resulting checklist to assess implementation fidelity is fit for
   assessing the delivery of vocational rehabilitation for stroke survivors
   using retrospective observational case review. The checklist proved its
   utility as a measure of fidelity and may be used to inform the design of
   future implementation strategies.},

Abstract = {Background In the EU, approx. 16.5\% of the 20-34-year-olds are Not in
   Education, Employment or Training (NEET). Research shows that good
   health is an important progression factor towards employment, and daily
   physical activity as well as participation in sports has a positive
   effect on physical and mental health as well as in the development of
   life skill. However, there is an absence of studies investigating what
   role physical activity can play in the employment efforts. The aim of
   this study is to investigate experiences with physical activity in
   employment interventions and to describe the development of a
   health-promoting employment intervention with physical activity for
   young people aged 18-30 years who are NEET. Methods The study combined
   an evidence-based approach with practice-based experiences. It included
   a Mapping of Danish employment interventions with physical activity for
   young people NEET, an overview of national reports and international
   literature, a workshop with leaders and employees from Danish
   municipalities, and fieldwork in four municipalities. Key findings were
   grouped thematically and were transformed into intervention content in a
   close dialog with relevant researchers and practitioners. Results In
   general, physical activity was assessed as a meaningful method when
   working with young people NEET. A range of positive experiences was
   highlighted, including successful experiences, surplus of mental
   resources, new ways of meeting, and new social relations. Based on these
   findings, a 16-week health-promoting employment intervention, NEXT STEP,
   was developed with the following intervention components: (1) fixed
   boundaries, (2) body and physical activity, (3) social relations and
   network, and (4) life skills and future. NEXT STEP is designed to be
   implemented in Danish job centers. Conclusion The study found the great
   potential of including physical activity in employment interventions for
   young people NEET. The planning and development of the intervention have
   reinforced a comprehensive evaluation; however, the first intervention
   in its entirety is ready for testing in a randomized feasibility trial.},

Title = {Data visualization as an intervention for pediatric chronic pain: a
   pilot feasibility study protocol for a randomized controlled crossover
   trial},

Abstract = {Background: Chronic pain is a common and costly condition in youth,
   associated with negative implications that reach far beyond the pain
   experience itself (e.g., interference with recreational, social, and
   academic activities, mental health sequelae). As a self-appraised
   condition, pain experience is influenced by patient's biases and
   meaning-making in relation to their symptoms and triggers. We propose
   that interacting with self-reported data will impact the experience of
   pain by altering understanding and expectations of symptom experience
   and how pain interacts with other factors (e.g., sleep, emotions, social
   interactions). In this study, we aim to establish the feasibility and
   acceptability of using a data visualization platform to track and
   monitor symptoms and their relationship with other factors, versus
   simply daily reporting of symptoms using a smartphone-based Ecological
   Momentary Assessment (EMA).
   Methods: This protocol is for a randomized, single-center, open-label
   crossover trial. We aim to recruit 50 typically developing youth aged
   12-18 years with chronic pain to take part in two phases of data
   collection. The trial will utilize an A-B counterbalanced design in
   which participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Part A
   (EMA alone for 7 days) or Part B (EMA plus visualization platform for 7
   days) first and then receive the opposite phase after a 7-day break
   (washout period). Key outcomes will be participant reports of
   acceptability and feasibility, EMA completion rates, barriers, and
   perceptions of the benefits or risks of participation. Secondary
   exploratory analyses will examine the relationship between EMA-reported
   symptoms over time and in relation to baseline measures, as well as
   pilot data on any improvements in symptoms related to engaging with the
   data visualization platform.
   Discussion: This protocol describes the feasibility and pilot testing of
   a novel approach to promoting self-management and facilitating symptom
   appraisal using visualized data. We aim to determine whether there is a
   sufficient rationale, both from the perspective of feasibility and
   patient satisfaction/acceptability, to conduct a larger randomized
   controlled trial of this intervention. This intervention has the
   potential to support clinical care for youth with chronic pain and other
   conditions where self-appraisal and understanding of symptom patterns
   are a critical component of functional recovery.},

Abstract = {Background: Having a stammer can have a significant effect on a child's
   social, emotional and educational development. With approximately 66,000
   children in the UK having a stammer, there is a need to establish an
   adequate evidence base to inform clinical practice. We describe a
   feasibility trial to explore the effectiveness of a new therapy
   programme for children aged 8-14: Palin Stammering Therapy for School
   Children (Palin STSC(8-14)). Preliminary data from the Michael Palin
   Centre, where the programme was developed, indicate that Palin
   STSC(8-14) is effective in reducing stammering frequency and impact for
   children, with beneficial effects for parents too. We will investigate
   the feasibility of the methods required for a definitive randomised
   controlled trial to investigate the application of this therapy by NHS
   speech and language therapists (SLTs), compared with `treatment as
   usual' (TAU), beyond the specialist context in which it was developed.
   Methods: This is a two-arm feasibility cluster-randomised controlled
   trial of Palin STSC(8-14) with TAU control arm, and randomisation at the
   level of the SLT. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected to
   examine the following: the recruitment and retention of therapists and
   families, the acceptability of the research processes and the
   therapeutic intervention and the appropriateness of the therapy outcome
   measures. Assessments will be completed by children and parents at
   baseline and 6 months later, including measures of stammering severity;
   the impact of child's stammering on both children and parents; child
   temperament, behaviour and peer relations, anxiety; quality of life; and
   economic outcomes. There will also be a qualitative process evaluation,
   including interviews with parents, children, SLTs and SLT managers to
   explore the acceptability of both the research and therapy methods.
   Treatment fidelity will be examined through analysis of therapy session
   records and recordings.
   Discussion: The findings of this feasibility trial will inform the
   decision as to whether to progress to a full-scale randomised controlled
   trial to explore the effectiveness of Palin STSC(8-14) when compared to
   Treatment as Usual in NHS SLT services. There is a strong need for an
   evidence-based intervention for school age children who stammer.},

Title = {Michigan Model for Health™ Learning to Enhance and Adapt for Prevention
   (Mi-LEAP): protocol of a pilot randomized trial comparing Enhanced
   Replicating Effective Programs versus standard implementation to deliver
   an evidence-based drug use prevention curriculum},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background: School-based drug use prevention programs have demonstrated
   notable potential to reduce the onset and escalation of drug use,
   including among youth at risk of poor outcomes such as those exposed to
   trauma. Researchers have found a robust relationship between
   intervention fidelity and participant (i.e., student) outcomes.
   Effective implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as the
   Michigan Model for Health(TM) (MMH), is critical to achieving desired
   public health objectives. Yet, a persistent gap remains in what we know
   works and how to effectively translate these findings into routine
   practice. The objective of this study is to design and test a
   multi-component implementation strategy to tailor MMH to meet population
   needs (i.e., students exposed to trauma), and improve the
   population-context fit to enhance fidelity and effectiveness.
   Methods: Using a 2-group, mixed-method randomized controlled trial
   design, this study will compare standard implementation versus Enhanced
   Replicating Effective Programs (REP) to deliver MMH. REP is a
   theoretically based implementation strategy that promotes evidence-based
   intervention (EBI) fidelity through a combination of EBI curriculum
   packaging, training, and as-needed technical assistance and is
   consistent with standard MMH implementation. Enhanced REP will tailor
   the intervention and training to integrate trauma-informed approaches
   and deploy customized implementation support (i.e., facilitation). The
   research will address the following specific aims: (1) design and test
   an implementation strategy (Enhanced REP) to deliver the MMH versus
   standard implementation and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and
   appropriateness using mixed methods, (2) estimate the costs and
   cost-effectiveness of Enhanced REP to deliver MMH versus standard
   implementation.
   Discussion: This research will design and test a multi-component
   implementation strategy focused on enhancing the fit between the
   intervention and population needs while maintaining fidelity to MMH core
   functions. We focus on the feasibility of deploying the implementation
   strategy bundle and costing methods and preliminary information on cost
   input distributions. The substantive focus on youth at heightened risk
   of drug use and its consequences due to trauma exposure is significant
   because of the public health impact of prevention. Pilot studies of
   implementation strategies are underutilized and can provide vital
   information on designing and testing effective strategies by addressing
   potential design and methods uncertainties and the effects of the
   implementation strategy on implementation and student outcomes.},

Abstract = {Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition of the central
   nervous system, affecting around 1 in every 600 people in the UK, with
   130 new diagnoses every week. Cognitive difficulties are common amongst
   people with MS, with up to 70\% experiencing deficits in higher-level
   brain functions-such as planning and problem-solving, attention, and
   memory. Cognitive deficits make it difficult for people with MS to
   complete everyday tasks and limit their abilities to work, socialise,
   and live independently. There is a clear need-and recognised research
   priority-for treatments that can improve cognitive functioning in people
   with MS. The absence of effective cognitive interventions exacerbates
   burdens on the services accessed by people with MS-requiring these
   services to manage sequelae of untreated cognitive deficits, including
   reduced quality of life, greater disability and dependence, and poorer
   adherence to disease-modifying treatments. Our planned research will
   fill the evidence gap through developing-and examining the feasibility
   of trialling-a novel online cognitive rehabilitation programme for
   people with MS (SMART). The SMART programme directly trains relational
   skills (the ability to flexibly relate concepts to one another) based on
   theory that these skills are critical to broader cognitive functioning.
   Methods The primary objective of this study aims to conduct a
   feasibility study to inform the development of a definitive trial of
   SMART for improving cognitive functioning in people with MS. The
   secondary objective is to develop the framework for a cost-effectiveness
   analysis alongside a definitive trial, and the exploratory objective is
   to assess the signal of efficacy. Discussion As a feasibility trial,
   outcomes are unlikely to immediately effect changes to NHS practice.
   However, this is a necessary step towards developing a definitive
   trial-and will give us a signal of efficacy, a prerequisite for
   progression to a definitive trial. If found to be clinically and
   cost-effective, the latter trial could create a step-change in MS
   cognitive rehabilitation-improving service delivery and optimising
   support with limited additional resources.},

Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background Local politicians can serve as enablers or barriers for
   health and social organizations to implement evidence, impacting the
   context of health and social service organizations. Increasing local
   politicians' knowledge about, and support for, evidence-based practice
   (EBP) could be a way to strengthen the conditions in social service
   organizations for EBP. The aim of the study was to describe the
   development and assess the perceived feasibility, acceptability, and
   appropriateness of an intervention to enable local political committees
   to support the implementation of EBP. Furthermore, the achievement of
   the learning outcomes was examined. Methods Workshops and interviews
   were used to co-create the intervention with social service
   representatives (n = 8) and local politicians (n = 6). A single-arm,
   non-blinded feasibility study was conducted in a social welfare
   committee with local politicians (n = 14) and representatives from
   social services (n = 4). Interviews and pre-post questionnaires were
   used to assess the intervention's feasibility, acceptability,
   appropriateness, and learning outcomes. Progression criteria was set to
   > 80\% of respondents judging the intervention to be feasible,
   acceptable, and appropriate. Thematic analysis and descriptive
   statistics were used for analysis. Results The quantitative and
   qualitative results indicate that the intervention was perceived as
   acceptable and appropriate. However, the progression criteria for
   feasibility were not fully met. Qualitative findings show that the
   intervention was perceived as interesting, fun, and created curiosity to
   learn more about EBP. The discussions between the committee and the
   representatives from the social services department were much valued.
   Conclusions Careful anchoring of the intervention and comprehensive
   local adaptation regarding delivery format will be central to the
   delivery of this intervention if offered elsewhere. Furthermore, we
   recommend that skills training during the intervention should be
   included. The collaboration between local politicians and
   representatives from the social services department was a vital aspect
   of the intervention and should not be excluded. Collaboration between
   these actors will be of significance in further developing support for
   EBP implementation, as expressed by the interview participants.},

Abstract = {Background: POSITIVE (i.e. maintaining and imPrOving the intrinSIc
   capaciTy Involving primary care and caregiVErs) is a new intervention
   program consisting of home-monitoring equipment and a communication
   platform to support treatment of frailty symptoms initially in primary
   care and prevent disability in older adults.
   Methods: The primary objectives are to estimate the potential efficacy
   of the POSITIVE system on improving frailty in at least one point in
   Fried's criteria and five points in Frailty Trait Scale. The secondary
   objectives are to (A) assess the recruitment, retention, drop-out rates,
   compliance with the intervention and the intervention mechanisms of
   impact; (B) evaluate the usability and acceptance of the POSITIVE
   system, and to get estimations on; (C) the potential efficacy of the
   intervention on improving the participants' physical performance,
   cognitive functions, mood, independency level in activities in daily
   living, the impact on quality of life and number of falls during the
   follow-up period; (D) the impact on the caregiver quality of life and
   caregiver burden; and (E) on the consumption of health care resources,
   participants' perception of health and level of care received, and
   healthcare professionals' workload and satisfaction.
   A randomised controlled, assessor-blinded pilot study design recruiting
   from a primary care centre in Stockholm Region will be conducted. Fifty
   older adults identified as pre-frail or frail will be randomised into a
   control or an intervention group. Both groups will receive a medical
   review, nutritional recommendations and Vivifrail physical exercise
   program. The intervention group will receive the POSITIVE-system
   including a tablet, the POSITIVE application and portable measurement
   devices. The participants receiving the POSITIVE program will be
   monitored remotely by a primary care nurse during a 6-month follow-up.
   Data will be collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months into the intervention
   though the platform, standardised assessments and surveys. A process
   evaluation as per Medical Research Council guidance will be conducted
   after the 6-month follow-up period.
   Discussion:The implications of the study are to provide estimations on
   the potential efficacy of the POSITIVE system in improving frailty among
   older adults and to provide relevant data to inform powered studies of
   potential efficacy and effectiveness, as well as to inform about the
   feasibility of the current study design.},

Abstract = {Background Smokeless tobacco (ST) is consumed globally by more than 350
   million people, with approximately 85\% of all users based in South and
   Southeast Asia. In this region, ST products are cheap and easily
   accessible. Evidence-based interventions to people quit ST use are
   lacking. This study aims to test the feasibility of conducting a future
   definitive trial of ST cessation, using a culturally adapted behavioural
   intervention, and/or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in three South
   Asian countries. Methods We will conduct a factorial design,
   randomised-controlled pilot trial in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.
   Daily ST users will be recruited from primary health care settings in
   Dhaka, Noida and Karachi. Participants will be individually randomised
   to receive intervention A (4 or 6 mg NRT chewing gum for 8-weeks),
   intervention B (BISCA: face-to-face behavioural support for ST
   cessation), a combination of interventions A and B or usual care (Very
   Brief Advice - VBA). The participants will provide demographic and ST
   use related data at baseline, and at 6, 12 and 26 weeks of follow-up.
   Salivary cotinine samples will be collected at baseline and 26 weeks.
   The analyses will undertake an assessment of the feasibility of
   recruitment, randomisation, data collection and participant retention,
   as well as the feasibility of intervention delivery. We will also
   identify potential cessation outcomes to inform the main trial,
   understand the implementation, context and mechanisms of impact through
   a process evaluation and, thirdly, establish health resource use and
   impact on the quality of life through health economic data. Discussion
   The widespread and continued use of ST products in South Asia is
   consistent with a high rate of associated diseases and negative impact
   on the quality of life. The identification of feasible, effective and
   cost-effective interventions for ST is necessary to inform national and
   regional efforts to reduce ST use at the population level. The findings
   of this pilot trial will inform the development of larger trials for ST
   cessation among South Asian users, with relevance to wider regions and
   populations having high rates of ST use.},

Title = {Planning and developing a web-based intervention for active surveillance
   in prostate cancer: an integrated self-care programme for managing
   psychological distress},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Objectives: To outline the planning, development and optimisation of a
   psycho-educational behavioural intervention for patients on active
   surveillance for prostate cancer. The intervention aimed to support men
   manage active surveillance-related psychological distress.
   Methods: The person-based approach (PBA) was used as the overarching
   guiding methodological framework for intervention development.
   Evidence-based methods were incorporated to improve robustness. The
   process commenced with data gathering activities comprising the
   following four components:
   A systematic review and meta-analysis of depression and anxiety in
   prostate cancer
   A cross-sectional survey on depression and anxiety in active
   surveillance
   A review of existing interventions in the field
   A qualitative study with the target audience
   The purpose of this paper is to bring these components together and
   describe how they facilitated the establishment of key guiding
   principles and a logic model, which underpinned the first draft of the
   intervention.
   Results: The prototype intervention, named PROACTIVE, consists of six
   Internet-based sessions run concurrently with three group support
   sessions. The sessions cover the following topics: lifestyle (diet and
   exercise), relaxation and resilience techniques, talking to friends and
   family, thoughts and feelings, daily life (money and work) and
   information about prostate cancer and active surveillance. The resulting
   intervention has been trialled in a feasibility study, the results of
   which are published elsewhere.
   Conclusions: The planning and development process is key to successful
   delivery of an appropriate, accessible and acceptable intervention. The
   PBA strengthened the intervention by drawing on target-user experiences
   to maximise acceptability and user engagement. This meticulous
   description in a clinical setting using this rigorous but flexible
   method is a useful demonstration for others developing similar
   interventions.},

Title = {Love Together, Parent Together (L2P2): a protocol for a feasibility
   study of a conflict reappraisal writing intervention for interparental
   couples with young children},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced or amplified stress and
   challenge within couples' relationships. Among those who are
   particularly vulnerable to heightened conflict and lower relationship
   satisfaction during this time are interparental couples with young
   children, whose relationships may have already been tenuous prior to the
   pandemic. Stress within the interparental relationship may have ripple
   effects on all family subsystems and child adjustment. The Love Together
   Parent Together (L2P2) program is a brief, low-intensity writing
   intervention adapted for parents of young children that was designed to
   reduce conflict-related distress and prevent declines in relationship
   satisfaction. Based on an original writing intervention by Finkel and
   colleagues, L2P2 has adapted the intervention duration and study
   population to be appropriate to the current global context. This study
   will examine the key feasibility metrics related to this adapted program
   with the goal of identifying problems and informing parameters of future
   pilot and/or main RCTs.
   Methods: The current study is a non-randomized feasibility study, using
   a single-arm, pre-test/post-test design to primarily assess the
   feasibility of an evaluative RCT, and to secondarily assess the
   potential effects on outcomes to be used in a future RCT. Couples will
   be recruited through three community-based agencies with the goal of
   obtaining a socio-demographically diverse sample. The first 20 couples
   to enroll will be included. Baseline and post-intervention surveys will
   be conducted, and a writing intervention will take place (three 7-min
   sessions over the course of 5 weeks). The primary outcomes will be
   feasibility metrics of recruitment rates, appropriateness of eligibility
   criteria, sample diversity, retention, uptake, adherence, and
   acceptability. In addition, we will develop an objective measure of
   couple ``we-ness{''} based on an analysis of writing samples. The
   secondary outcomes will include couples' measures (i.e., relationship
   quality, perceived partner responsiveness, self-reported responsiveness,
   conflict-related distress), and additional family outcomes (i.e.,
   parent-child relations, parental/child mental health). Criteria for
   success are outlined, and failure to meet the criteria will result in
   adaptations to the measurement schedule, intervention design,
   recruitment approach, and/or other elements of the program.
   Discussion: This feasibility study will inform several components of the
   procedures used for a subsequent pilot RCT, in which we will examine the
   feasibility of the methodology used to evaluate the program (e.g.,
   randomization, attrition to follow-up assessment/across groups, and
   sample size estimation, preliminary effectiveness), as well as the main
   RCT, which will investigate the effectiveness of the intervention on
   primary outcome measures and mediating pathways.},

Abstract = {Background Evidence for the effectiveness of interventions aimed at
   improving the health-related quality of life of people living with
   cancer and/or family members is compelling. However, most interventional
   research has been conducted in high-income countries, and no
   intervention had been tested in low-income countries such as Nigeria. It
   is critical to design a culturally theory-based intervention in a
   resource-poor setting to address the needs and support coping strategies
   of cancer patients and their family caregivers. Methods Theory,
   evidence, and practical issues were considered. The Medical Research
   Council framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions
   and Behaviour Change Wheel provided the framework for intervention
   design. Findings generated by a needs assessment of adult Nigerians with
   cancer and their family caregivers and relevant theories (the
   Spirituality and the Supportive Care Framework for Cancer) informed
   content development. Results A theory-based, culturally tailored
   socio-spiritual intervention was developed to address the specific needs
   of adult Nigerians with cancer and their family caregivers. A 4-week
   intervention included strategies designed to improve social and
   spiritual support, information and health literacy, and health-related
   quality of life. Conclusions A systemic approach was used to
   conceptualise an evidence-based and theory-informed intervention
   tailored to address previously identified shortfalls in support
   available to adults living with cancer and their family caregivers, in
   Nigeria. If implemented and effective, such an intervention has the
   potential to improve the health-related quality of life of people living
   with cancer and their families in Nigeria.},

Title = {Enhancing national audit through addressing the quality improvement
   capabilities of feedback recipients: a multi-phase intervention
   development study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Background National audits are a common, but variably effective,
   intervention to improve services. This study aimed to design an
   intervention to increase the effectiveness of national audit. Methods We
   used interviews, documentary analysis, observations, co-design and
   stakeholder engagement methods. The intervention was described in an
   intervention manual and illustrated using a logic model. Phase 1
   described the current hospital response to a national audit. Phase 2
   identified potential enhancements. Phase 3 developed a strategy to
   implement the enhancements. Phase 4 explored the feasibility of the
   intervention alongside the National Audit of Dementia and refined the
   intervention. Phase 5 adapted the intervention to a second national
   audit (National Diabetes Audit). Phase 6 explored the feasibility and
   fidelity of the intervention alongside the National Diabetes Audit and
   used the findings to further refine the intervention. Results The
   developed intervention is a quality improvement collaborative (QIC),
   containing virtual educational workshop, virtual outreach for local team
   leads and virtual facilitation of a learning collaborative delivered
   after feedback has been received. The QIC aims to support national audit
   recipients to undertake improvement actions tailored to their local
   context. The target audience is clinical and clinical governance
   leaders. We found that actions from national audit were constrained by
   what the clinical lead perceived they deliver personally, these actions
   were not aligned to identified influences upon performance. We found
   that the hospital response could be enhanced by targeting low baseline
   performance, identifying and addressing influences upon to performance,
   developing trust and credibility, addressing recipient priorities,
   presenting meaningful comparisons, developing a conceptual model,
   involving stakeholders and considering the opportunity cost. Phase 3
   found that an educational workshop and outreach strategy could support
   implementation of the enhancements through developing coherence and
   cognitive participation. We found feasibility could be increased by
   revising the content, re-naming the intervention, amending activities to
   address time commitment, incorporating a more structured analysis of
   influences, supporting collaboration and developing local feedback
   mechanisms. Phase 5 found adaptation to a second national audit involved
   reflecting differences in the clinical topic, context and contractual
   requirements. We found that the behaviour change techniques identified
   in the manual were delivered by facilitators. Participants reported
   positive attitudes towards the intervention and that the intervention
   was appropriate. Conclusions The QIC supports local teams to tailor
   their actions to local context and develop change commitment. Future
   work will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention as an adjunct
   to the National Diabetes Audit.},

Title = {A mixed-methods feasibility study of a comorbidity-adapted exercise
   program for low back pain in older adults (COMEBACK): a protocol},

Abstract = {Background: The prevalence of low back pain increases with age and has a
   profound impact on physical and psychosocial health. With increasing age
   comes increasing comorbidity, and this also has pronounced health
   consequences. Whilst exercise is beneficial for a range of health
   conditions, trials of exercise for low back pain management often
   exclude older adults. It is currently unknown whether an exercise
   program for older adults with low back pain, tailored for the presence
   of comorbidities, is acceptable for participants and primary healthcare
   providers (PHCPs). Therefore, this mixed-methods study will assess the
   feasibility of an 8-week comorbidity-adapted exercise program for older
   people with low back pain and comorbid conditions.
   Methods: The 3-phased feasibility study will be performed in a primary
   healthcare setting. PHCPs will be trained to deliver a
   comorbidity-adapted exercise program for older people with low back pain
   and comorbidities. Healthcareseeking adults > 65 will be screened for
   eligibility over telephone, with a recruitment target of 24
   participants. Eligible participants will attend an initial appointment
   (diagnostic phase). During this initial appointment, a research
   assistant will collect patient demographics, self-reported outcome
   measurement data, and perform a physical and functional examination to
   determine contraindications and restrictions to an exercise program.
   During the development phase, PHCPs will adapt the exercise program to
   the individual and provide patient education. During the intervention
   phase, there will be two supervised exercise sessions per week, over 8
   weeks (total of 16 exercise sessions). Each exercise session will be
   approximately 60 min in duration. A qualitative evaluation after the
   last exercise program session will explore the feasibility of the
   exercise program for participants and PHCPs. Progression criteria will
   determine the suitability for a fully powered randomised controlled
   trial.
   Discussion: This mixed-methods feasibility study will assess an exercise
   program for older adults with low back pain and comorbidities. Once
   assessed for feasibility, the exercise program may be tested for
   effectiveness in a larger, fully powered randomised controlled trial.
   This information will add to the sparse evidence base on appropriate
   options for managing back pain in older adults.},

Title = {Muslim Communities Learning About Second-hand Smoke in Bangladesh
   (MCLASS II): a combined evidence and theory-based plus partnership
   intervention development approach},

Abstract = {Introduction Deaths from second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure are
   increasing, but there is not sufficient evidence to recommend a
   particular SHS intervention or intervention development approach.
   Despite the available guidance on intervention reporting, and on the
   role and nature of pilot and feasibility studies, partial reporting of
   SHS interventions is common. The decision-making whilst developing such
   interventions is often under-reported. This paper describes the
   processes and decisions employed during transitioning from the aim of
   adapting an existing mosque-based intervention focused on public health
   messages, to the development of the content of novel community-based
   Smoke-Free Home (SFH) intervention. The intervention aims to promote
   smoke-free homes to reduce non-smokers' exposure to SHS in the home via
   faith-based messages. Methods The development of the SFH intervention
   had four sequential phases: in-depth interviews with adults in
   households in Dhaka, identification of an intervention programme theory
   and content with Islamic scholars from the Bangladesh Islamic Foundation
   (BIF), user testing of candidate intervention content with adults, and
   iterative intervention development workshops with Imams and khatibs who
   trained at the BIF. Results It was judged inappropriately to take an
   intervention adaptation approach. Following the identification of an
   intervention programme theory and collaborating with stakeholders in an
   iterative and collaborative process to identify barriers, six
   potentially modifiable constructs were identified. These were targeted
   with a series of behaviour change techniques operationalised as Quranic
   verses with associated health messages to be used as the basis for
   Khutbahs. Following iterative user testing, acceptable intervention
   content was generated. Conclusion The potential of this community-based
   intervention to reduce SHS exposure at home and improve lung health
   among non-smokers in Bangladesh is the result of an iterative and
   collaborative process. It is the result of the integration of behaviour
   change evidence and theory and community stakeholder contributions to
   the production of the intervention content. This novel combination of
   intervention development frameworks demonstrates a flexible approach
   that could provide insights for intervention development in related
   contexts.},

Title = {Development and evaluation of a remote training strategy for the

Abstract = {Background An increasing number of schools in rural settings are
   implementing multi-tier positive behavioral interventions and supports
   (PBIS) to address school-climate problems. PBIS can be used to provide
   the framework for the implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs)
   to address children's mental health concerns. Given the large service
   disparities for children in rural areas, offering EBPs through PBIS can
   improve access and lead to better long-term outcomes. A key challenge is
   that school personnel need technical assistance in order to implement
   EBPs with fidelity and clinical effectiveness. Providing ongoing on-site
   support is not feasible or sustainable in the majority of rural schools,
   due to their remote physical location. For this reason, remote training
   technology has been recommended for providing technical assistance to
   behavioral health staff (BHS) in under-served rural communities.
   Objectives The purpose of this study is to use the user-centered design,
   guided by an iterative process (rapid prototyping), to develop and
   evaluate the appropriateness, feasibility, acceptability, usability, and
   preliminary student outcomes of two online training strategies for the
   implementation of EBPs at PBIS Tier 2. Methods The study will employ a
   pragmatic design comprised of a mixed-methods approach for the
   development of the training platform, and a hybrid type 2, pilot
   randomized controlled trial to examine the implementation and student
   outcomes of two training strategies: Remote Video vs. Remote Video plus
   Coaching. Discussion There is a clear need for well-designed remote
   training studies focused on training in non-traditional settings. Given
   the lack of well-trained mental health professionals in rural settings
   and the stark disparities in access to services, the development and
   pilot-testing of a remote training strategy for BHS in under-served
   rural schools could have a significant public health impact. Ethics and
   dissemination The project was reviewed and approved by the institutional
   review board. Results will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov and
   disseminated to community partners and participants, peer-reviewed
   journals, and academic conferences.},

Abstract = {Background: Community- and strengths-based psychosocial interventions
   are central to mental health and psychosocial support guidelines, but
   rigorous evidence regarding the effectiveness of these interventions is
   limited. The complexity and variability that is inherent to many
   community-based psychosocial interventions requires innovative
   strategies in order to facilitate the comparability and synthesis across
   research studies without compromising the fit and appropriateness of
   interventions to specific study populations and context. Entre Nosotras
   is a community-based psychosocial intervention developed for migrant and
   host community women that is designed to be flexible enough to enable
   integration of external intervention components and adaptable to diverse
   study contexts and populations. This protocol describes a study that
   aims to evaluate the appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility of
   integrating a standardized stress management intervention into Entre
   Nosotras.
   Methods: This study will evaluate the appropriateness, acceptability,
   feasibility, and safety of intervention and research procedures for a
   cluster randomized comparative effectiveness trial conducted in Ecuador
   and Panama with migrant and host community women. In this feasibility
   trial, we will allocate communities nested within the three study sites
   to the integrated Entre Nosotras + stress management intervention versus
   Entre Nosotras alone through stratified randomization. Migrant and host
   community women residing in these study communities who report low to
   moderate levels of distress will be allocated to the intervention
   condition that their community is assigned (n = 220 total). We will
   collect quantitative measures of psychosocial wellbeing, psychological
   distress, coping, social support, and functioning from study
   participants. We will collect quantitative measures of fidelity and
   facilitator competencies through observation and facilitator
   self-assessment. Data on appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility,
   and safety will be gathered from participants and facilitators through
   quantitative assessments at 0, 5, and 10 weeks post-enrollment and
   qualitative interviews conducted with all facilitators and a subset of
   70 study participants during the post-intervention follow-up period.
   Discussion: Results from this feasibility trial will determine whether a
   multi-site cluster randomized comparative effectiveness trial of an
   adaptable community-based psychosocial intervention for migrant and host
   community women is relevant, acceptable, and feasible.},

Abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity is a main cause of childhood obesity
   which tracks into adulthood obesity, making it important to address
   early in life. Physical activity on prescription (PAP) is an
   evidence-based intervention that has shown good effect on physical
   activity levels in adults, but has not been evaluated in children with
   obesity. This project aims to evaluate the prerequisites, determinants,
   and feasibility of implementing PAP adapted to children with obesity and
   to explore children's, parents', and healthcare providers' experiences
   of PAP.
   Methods: In the first phase of the project, healthcare providers and
   managers from 26 paediatric clinics in Region Vastra Gotaland, Sweden,
   will be invited to participate in a web-based survey and a subset of
   this sample for a focus group study. Findings from these two data
   collections will form the basis for adaptation of PAP to the target
   group and context. In a second phase, this adapted PAP intervention will
   be evaluated in a clinical study in a sample of approximately 60
   children with obesity (ISO-BMI > 30) between 6 and 12 years of age and
   one of their parents/legal guardians. Implementation process and
   clinical outcomes will be assessed pre- and post-intervention and at 8
   and 12 months' follow-up. Implementation outcomes are the four core
   constructs of the Normalization Process Theory; coherence, cognitive
   participation, collective action, and reflexive monitoring; and
   appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility of the PAP intervention.
   Additional implementation process outcomes are recruitment and attrition
   rates, intervention fidelity, dose, and adherence. Clinical outcomes are
   physical activity pattern, BMI, metabolic risk factors, health-related
   quality of life, sleep, and self-efficacy and motivation for physical
   activity. Lastly, we will explore the perspectives of children and
   parents in semi-structured interviews. Design and analysis of the
   included studies are guided by the Normalization Process Theory.
   Discussion: This project will provide new knowledge regarding the
   feasibility of PAP for children with obesity and about whether and how
   an evidence-based intervention can be fitted and adapted to new contexts
   and populations. The results may inform a larger scale trial and future
   implementation and may enhance the role of PAP in the management of
   obesity in paediatric health care in Sweden.},

Abstract = {Background: The number of incident cases and deaths from primary liver
   cancer, predominantly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has increased
   markedly in the last two decades. HCC is generally diagnosed at an
   advanced stage, and most new cases are in people aged over 70 years with
   age-related comorbidities. Treatment options are often limited, with
   most patients receiving palliative treatment or supportive care only. As
   a consequence, maintaining quality of life (QoL) through symptom
   management is critically important and is a core objective of clinical
   care. Strong evidence supports the efficacy of supervised exercise
   training for addressing certain cancer-related symptoms, including QoL,
   physical function, and fatigue. However, there are many barriers to
   implementing supervised exercise programmes within cancer care pathways,
   including economic pressures on healthcare systems and personal barriers
   for patients. Recent advances in technology allow patients to exercise
   at home under the'virtual'supervision of an exercise professional
   through videoconferencing software (termed `telehealth exercise').
   Despite its potential, there are uncertainties relating to the
   feasibility, acceptability, and safety of telehealth exercise in people
   living with HCC.
   Methods: This is a protocol for a prospective, single-centre,
   single-arm, pretest-posttest feasibility trial. We aim to recruit 20
   patients aged 60 years or older who have received treatment for HCC and
   are undergoing routine clinical monitoring. Patients will be invited to
   take part in two online, home-based, group exercise sessions per week
   for 10 consecutive weeks. The `virtual' exercise sessions will be
   delivered in real time by an exercise professional through
   videoconferencing software. Each session will comprise 30 min of aerobic
   and resistance exercise performed at a moderate intensity, as guided by
   the 10-point Borg rating of perceived exertion scale. Feasibility
   outcomes include recruitment, retention, adherence, intervention
   fidelity, and safety. Acceptability of the intervention will be assessed
   using a mixed-methods approach via monthly online surveys and an exit
   telephone interview. Physical function, accelerometry-measured physical
   activity, mid-upper arm circumference, and patient-reported outcome
   measures (PROMS) will be assessed before and after the intervention to
   determine the feasibility of assessing outcome measures. Physical
   function outcomes include the short physical performance battery and
   Liver Frailty Index. PROMS include the Functional Assessment of Cancer
   Therapy-Hepatobiliary questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Chronic
   Illness Therapy-Fatigue questionnaire, Activities-specific Balance
   Confidence scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Godin
   Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire.
   Discussion: This mixed-methods study will address uncertainties relating
   to the feasibility and acceptability of delivering live, online,
   home-based, group exercise sessions to patients with HCC. The findings
   will inform whether any modifications are required to refine and
   optimise the intervention, and the assessment of outcome measures will
   provide information on the likely size and variability of intervention
   effects. Collectively, the data generated will inform the design of a
   subsequent, adequately powered, randomised controlled trial to evaluate
   the efficacy of the telehealth exercise intervention.},

   ADHD-the rationale and a non-randomised feasibility study},

Abstract = {Background: Dietary interventions have been previously explored in
   children with ADHD. Elimination diets and supplementation can produce
   beneficial behaviour changes, but little is known about the mechanisms
   mediating change. We propose that these interventions may work, in part,
   by causing changes in the gut microbiota. A microbiome-targeted dietary
   intervention was developed, and its feasibility assessed.
   Methods: A non-randomised feasibility study was conducted on nine
   non-medicated children with ADHD, aged 8-13 years (mean 10.39 years),
   using a prospective one-group pre-test/post-test design. Participants
   were recruited from ADHD support groups in London and took part in the
   6-week microbiome-targeted dietary intervention, which was specifically
   designed to impact the composition of gut bacteria. Children were
   assessed pre- and post-intervention on measures of ADHD symptomatology,
   cognition, sleep, gut function and stool-sample microbiome analysis. The
   primary aim was to assess the study completion rate, with secondary aims
   assessing adherence, adverse events (aiming for no severe and minimal),
   acceptability and suitability of outcome measures.
   Results: Recruitment proved to be challenging and despite targeting 230
   participants directly through support groups, and many more through
   social media, nine families (of the planned 10) signed up for the trial.
   The completion rate for the study was excellent at 100\%. Exploration of
   secondary aims revealed that (1) adherence to each aspect of the dietary
   protocol was very good; (2) two mild adverse events were reported; (3)
   parents rated the treatment as having good acceptability; (4) data
   collection and outcome measures were broadly feasible for use in an RCT
   with a few suggestions recommended; (5) descriptive data for outcome
   measures is presented and suggests that further exploration of gut
   microbiota, ADHD symptoms and sleep would be helpful in future research.
   Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for the
   feasibility of a microbiome-targeted dietary intervention in children
   with ADHD. Recruitment was challenging, but the diet itself was
   well-tolerated and adherence was very good. Families wishing to trial
   this diet may find it an acceptable intervention. However, recruitment,
   even for this small pilot study, was challenging. Because of the
   difficulty experienced recruiting participants, future randomised
   controlled trials may wish to adopt a simpler dietary approach which
   requires less parental time and engagement, in order to recruit the
   number of participants required to make meaningful statistical
   interpretations of efficacy.},

Title = {``Nourish to Flourish{''}: complementary feeding for a healthy infant

Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Background: The introduction of complementary foods and changes in milk
   feeding result in modifications to gastrointestinal function. The
   interplay between indigestible carbohydrates, host physiology, and
   microbiome, and immune system development are areas of intense research
   relevant to early and later-life health.
   Methods: This 6-month prospective non-randomised feasibility study was
   conducted in Auckland, New Zealand (NZ), in January 2018. Forty
   parents/caregivers and their infants were enrolled, with 30 infants
   allocated to receive a prebiotic NZ kumara (flesh and skin; a type of
   sweet potato) prepared as a freeze-dried powder, and ten infants
   allocated to receive a commercially available probiotic control known to
   show relevant immune benefits (10(9) CFU Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12
   (R)). The primary outcome was the study feasibility measures which are
   reported here.
   Results: Recruitment, participant retention, and data collection met
   feasibility targets. Some limitations to biological sample collection
   were encountered, with difficulties in obtaining sufficient plasma
   sample volumes for the proposed immune parameter analyses. Acceptability
   of the kumara powder was met with no reported adverse events.
   Conclusion: This study indicates that recruiting infants before
   introducing complementary foods is feasible, with acceptable adherence
   to the food-based intervention. These results will inform the protocol
   of a full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) with adjustments to
   the collection of biological samples to examine the effect of a
   prebiotic food on the prevalence of respiratory tract infections during
   infancy.},

Title = {Health systems strengthening interventions for perinatal common mental
   disorders and experiences of domestic violence in Cape Town, South
   Africa: protocol for a pilot implementation study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Background: During the perinatal period, common mental disorders (CMDs)
   such as depression and anxiety are highly prevalent, especially in
   low-resource settings, and are associated with domestic violence,
   poverty, and food insecurity. Perinatal CMDs have been associated with
   several adverse maternal and child outcomes. While the Department of
   Health in South Africa provides healthcare workers with the tools to
   detect psychological distress and experiences of domestic violence, few
   healthcare workers routinely screen pregnant women at clinic visits,
   citing discomfort with mental health issues and the lack of standardised
   referral pathways as the key barriers. The aim of this study is to
   select and evaluate a set of health systems strengthening (HSS)
   interventions aimed at improving the care and outcomes for perinatal
   women with CMDs and experiences of domestic violence, attending public
   healthcare facilities in Cape Town.
   Methods: This study consists of a pre-implementation, development, and
   implementation phase. Contextual barriers identified during the
   pre-implementation phase included poor patient knowledge and
   health-seeking behaviour, high levels of stigma, and poor detection,
   referral, and treatment rates. Implementation science determinant
   frameworks were applied to findings from the pre-implementation phase to
   identify determinants and gaps in delivering high-quality
   evidence-informed care. A participatory Theory of Change workshop was
   used to design a HSS programme, consisting of awareness raising,
   detection, referral, and treatment. HSS interventions selected to
   support the delivery of the HSS programme includes training, health
   promotion, change to the healthcare environment, task-sharing, audit and
   feedback, and performance monitoring. The implementation phase will be
   used to assess several implementation and clinical outcomes associated
   with the delivery of the HSS programme, which will be piloted at three
   healthcare facilities. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used
   to evaluate the implementation and clinical outcomes.
   Discussion: This pilot implementation study will inform us about a range
   of implementation and clinical outcome measures that are relevant for
   assessing HSS interventions for perinatal women with depression,
   anxiety, or experiences of domestic violence in low-resource settings.
   Lessons learnt from the pilot study will be incorporated into the design
   of a cluster randomised control trial for which further funding will be
   sought.},

Title = {Protocol update for a randomised controlled feasibility trial of
   exercise rehabilitation for people with postural tachycardia syndrome:
   the PULSE study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Background: The PULSE (PostUraL tachycardia Syndrome Exercise) study is
   a randomised controlled trial assessing the feasibility of conducting a
   multicentre RCT testing supervised exercise rehabilitation with
   behavioural and motivational support, compared to best-practice usual
   care, for people with Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS). The original
   trial protocol was published in BMC Pilot \& Feasibility Studies
   (accessible at https://doi.org/10.1186/s40814-020-00702-1). The PULSE
   intervention consists of (1) individual assessment; (2) 12-week,
   twice-weekly, supervised exercise training; (3) behavioural and
   motivational support; and (4) guided lifestyle physical activity. The
   control intervention is best-practice usual care with a single 30-min,
   one-to-one practitioner appointment, and general advice on safe and
   effective physical activity.
   Sixty-two people (aged 18-60 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of PoTS
   will be invited to enrol on a feasibility RCT with an embedded
   qualitative study. The primary outcome will be feasibility;
   process-related measures will include eligibility, recruitment,
   randomisation and withdrawal rates, along with indicators of exercise
   programme adherence and acceptability. Secondary physiological, clinical
   and health-related outcomes will be assessed. In response to the
   COVID-19 pandemic, here we describe amendments to the trial protocol.
   Methods: Restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic meant it was
   necessary to change the delivery of the PULSE and control interventions.
   These changes reflected the need to limit the risk of COVID-19
   transmission in a clinical population, some of whom were at increased
   risk of contracting the virus and suffering serious illness. The major
   change was that the originally intended centre-based PULSE and control
   interventions would now be delivered remotely on-line. Subsequently,
   there were minor changes to the participant eligibility criteria. These
   decisions followed an on-line co-creation session with people affected
   by PoTS, and relevant public and professional stakeholders.
   Conclusions: We present an update of the original trial protocol in
   response to the COVID-19 pandemic. No participants were recruited to the
   original protocol; thus, results will reflect the on-line delivery of
   the intervention. PULSE will be the first randomised trial to assess the
   feasibility of conducting a definitive multi-centre RCT testing
   supervised on-line exercise rehabilitation with behavioural and
   motivational support, compared to best-practice usual care, for people
   with PoTS.},

Title = {Suubi4Stigma study protocol: a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial
   to address HIV-associated stigma among adolescents living with HIV in
   Uganda},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Background: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is heavily burdened by HIV, with
   85\% of the global new infections among adolescents happening in the
   region. With advances in medication and national policies promoting
   antiretroviral therapy (ART), children < 15 years living with HIV (CLWH)
   continue to grow with a chronic, highly stigmatized disease.
   Unfortunately, the stigma they experience results in much lower quality
   of life, including poor mental health and treatment outcomes. Family
   members also experience stigma and shame by virtue of their association
   with an HIV-infected family member. Yet, stigma-reduction interventions
   targeting CLWH and their families are very limited. The goal of this
   study is to address HIV-associated stigma among CLWH and their
   caregivers in Uganda.
   Methods: This three-arm cluster randomized control trial, known as
   Suubi4Stigma, will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
   preliminary impact of two evidence-based interventions: (1) group
   cognitive behavioral therapy (G-CBT) focused on cognitive restructuring
   and strengthening coping skills at the individual level and (2) a
   multiple family group (MFG) intervention that strengthens family
   relationships to address stigma among CLWH (N = 90, 10-14 years) and
   their families (dyads) in Uganda. Nine clinics will be randomized to one
   of three study arms (n = 3 clinics, 30 child-caregiver dyads each): (1)
   usual care; (2) G-CBT + usual care; and (3) MFG + usual care. Both
   treatment and control conditions will be delivered over a 3-month
   period. Data will be collected at baseline (pre-intervention) and at 3
   months and 6 months post-intervention initiation.
   Conclusion: The primary aim of the proposed project is to address the
   urgent need for theoretically and empirically informed interventions
   that seek to reduce HIV-associated stigma and its negative impact on
   adolescent health and psychosocial well-being. As several countries in
   SSA grapple with care and support for CLWH, this study will lay the
   foundation for a larger intervention study investigating how
   HIV-associated stigma can be reduced to foster healthy child
   development-especially for CLWH as they transition through adolescence.},

Abstract = {Background: People with advanced cancer need to balance their resources
   and energy in order to experience enjoyment and quality of life in the
   time they have left. A resource-oriented intervention is developed
   targeting these aspects. The present protocol presents a feasibility
   study of this resource-oriented intervention in people with advanced
   cancer.
   Methods: A feasibility study with a repeated-measurement design without
   a control group will be conducted at the research clinic of REHPA, the
   Danish Knowledge Center for Rehabilitation and Palliative Care. Data
   will be gathered at baseline, during and after a 5-day residential stay,
   after 6 weeks, during a 2-day follow-up stay and after 12 weeks. In
   total, 20-25 home-living adults (>= 18 years) with advanced cancer
   reporting needs in everyday life will be recruited. The intervention
   consists of workshops and engagement in physical and creative everyday
   activities provided by a multidisciplinary team.
   Outcome measures are quality of life, physical function and fatigue,
   which will be assessed using the European Organisation for Research and
   Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core-30. Balance in
   everyday activities will be assessed using the Occupational Balance
   Questionnaire.
   Feasibility data will also be collected regarding (1) fidelity, (2)
   adherence, (3) dose and (4) reach and mechanisms of impact. For
   exploration of mechanism of impact, participant observations and focus
   group interviews will be used.
   Discussion: This study presents a new approach in rehabilitation and
   palliative care aimed at supporting people with advanced cancer; instead
   of identification of problems, the present resource-oriented palliative
   rehabilitation intervention will target people's resources, enhancing
   balance in everyday activities and underpinning enjoyment and quality of
   life. The results from the feasibility study can inform ways in which to
   support the everyday life of people with advanced cancer and thus have
   potential to improve their quality of life. The long-term perspectives
   are to evaluate the intervention in terms of effect, process and
   cost-effectiveness. This will provide evidence to adjust the content of
   rehabilitation and palliative care for this group of people.},

Abstract = {Background Bedtime routines are highly recurrent family activities with
   implications for children's wellbeing, development and health. Aims The
   objective of this study is to co-develop and test in a feasibility,
   proof-of-concept study a bedtime routines intervention using text
   messages aimed at first-time parents with young children. Methods Fifty
   first-time parents with children aged 1-3 years were recruited for this
   study. Parents received a text message-based intervention for
   7-consecutive nights which provided support and information on achieving
   optimal bedtime routines. Parents completed pre- and post-intervention
   questionnaires focusing on children's sleep, bedtime routines and
   parental mood disturbance. Feedback was provided at the end of the
   study. Results Recruitment target and high retention with 98\%, or 49
   out of 50 participants completing the study were achieved. Pre- and
   post-intervention, there were improvements in total children's sleep
   with children sleeping longer and having less disrupted sleep overall
   (MD = - 7.77 (SD = 17.91), t(48) = - 3.03, p = .004, CI (- 12.91, -
   2.63) and in overall quality of bedtime routines (MD = - 5.00, SD =
   7.01, t(48) = - 4.98, p < .001, CI (- 7.01, - 2.98). Parental mood
   disturbance decreased pre- to post-intervention (MD = 5.87, SD = 15.43,
   t(48) = 2.66), p = .010, CI (1.44, 10.30). Parents provided positive
   feedback about the intervention and valued the support that was provided
   to them. Conclusions Bedtime routines were successfully altered with
   short-term benefits for children's sleep and parental mood. Future
   research will need to utilize a more robust, longitudinal approach for a
   definite exploration of sustained changes in bedtime routines and their
   long-term implications for children and parents.},

Abstract = {Background Childcare-based physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior
   (SB) interventions have traditionally used in-person training to
   supplement early childhood educators' (ECEs) knowledge and confidence to
   facilitate physically active programming for the children in their care.
   However, this method of delivery is resource-intensive and unable to
   reach a high number of ECEs. The purpose of the Training pre-service
   EArly CHildhood educators in PA (TEACH) pilot study was to test the
   implementation (e.g., fidelity, feasibility, acceptability) of an
   e-Learning course targeting PA and SB among a sample of pre-service
   (i.e., post-secondary students) and in-service (i.e., practicing) ECEs
   in Canada. Methods A pre-/post-study design was adopted for this pilot
   study, and implementation outcomes were assessed cross-sectionally at
   post-intervention. Pre-service ECEs were purposefully recruited from
   three Canadian colleges and in-service ECEs were recruited via social
   media. Upon completing the e-Learning course, process evaluation surveys
   (n = 32 pre-service and 121 in-service ECEs) and interviews (n = 3
   pre-service and 8 in-service ECEs) were completed to gather ECEs'
   perspectives on the e-Learning course. Fidelity was measured via
   e-Learning course metrics retrieved from the web platform. Descriptive
   statistics were calculated for quantitative data, and thematic analysis
   was conducted to analyze qualitative data. Results Moderate-to-high
   fidelity to the TEACH study e-Learning course was exhibited by
   pre-service (68\%) and in-service (63\%) ECEs. Participants reported
   that the course was highly acceptable, compatible, effective, feasible,
   and appropriate in complexity; however, some ECEs experienced technical
   difficulties with the e-Learning platform and noted a longer than
   anticipated course duration. The most enjoyed content for pre- and
   in-service ECEs focused on outdoor play (87.5\% and 91.7\%,
   respectively) and risky play (84.4\% and 88.4\%, respectively).
   Conclusions These findings demonstrate the value of e-Learning for
   professional development interventions for ECEs. Participant feedback
   will be used to make improvements to the TEACH e-Learning course to
   improve scalability of this training.},

Title = {Development and feasibility testing of a physical activity intervention

Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders in children and adolescents
   are highly prevalent and account for more than half of all youth
   psychiatric disorders. Left untreated, anxiety, and depression lead to
   numerous detrimental outcomes, including reduced quality of life,
   psychiatric, and somatic comorbidity and even reduced lifespan. This
   puts a large strain on child and adolescent mental healthcare services
   (CAMHS) to provide effective treatments. However, even when provided the
   best evidence-based treatment, between 40-50\% of patients continue to
   report significant symptom burdens. Thus, there is an immediate need for
   supplemental and/or new treatment approaches. Physical activity as a
   supplementary treatment may be such an approach. However, research
   investigating this approach within this population is scant. This
   protocol paper describes the development and feasibility trial of a
   physical activity-based intervention targeting anxiety and depressive
   symptoms in youth treated in CAMHS.
   Methods/design: The study is based on the UK Medical Council Research
   Framework (MRC) for developing and evaluating complex interventions.
   Feasibility and acceptability of the physical activity intervention
   (confident, active, and happy youth) will be evaluated in an
   uncontrolled open-label trial using qualitative and quantitative data.
   Twenty youths with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be recruited.
   Acceptability of assessment procedures, the intervention, and perceived
   benefits and barriers to participation will be assessed, and qualitative
   interviews with participants, caregivers, and referring specialists will
   explore contextual and practical factors associated with intervention
   delivery. Physical activity will be measured using the Actigraph GT3X+
   monitor at baseline, and post-intervention and change in anxiety and
   depression will be assessed.
   Discussion: This study will contribute to the development of
   supplementary physical treatment interventions for youth with anxiety
   and depression in contact with CAMHS. The goal is to examine new avenues
   of treatment that ultimately may improve upon current treatment outcomes
   of anxiety and depression. This work will be in preparation for a future
   definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) of this approach, in line
   with the MRC Framework.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Obesity in women has more than doubled in the past thirty
   years. Increasing research suggests that increased cardiorespiratory
   fitness (CRF) can largely attenuate the negative health risks associated
   with obesity. Though previous literature suggests that combined training
   may be the most effective for improving CRF in adults with obesity,
   there is minimal research investigating the efficacy of combined and
   resistance programmes in women with obesity. This article outlines a
   protocol for a parallel pilot study which aims to evaluate the
   feasibility and efficacy of three exercise modalities in women with
   obesity for increasing CRF and strength and improving body composition
   and other health outcomes (i.e. quality of life).
   Methods and analysis: Sixty women (aged 18-50) with obesity (body mass
   index {[}BMI] >= 30 and/or waist circumference >= 88 cm) who are
   physically inactive, have no unstable health conditions and are safe to
   exercise will be recruited from September 2021 to December 2022. The
   main outcome will be feasibility and acceptability of the intervention
   and procedures. Trial feasibility outcomes will be evaluated to
   determine if a definitive trial should be undertaken. Trial
   acceptability will be explored through follow-up qualitative interviews
   with participants. Secondary outcomes will include CRF (predicted VO2
   max), anthropometrics (i.e. BMI), strength (5RM bench press, leg
   dynamometry, grip strength) and other health outcomes (i.e., pain).
   Participants will be block randomised into one of four trial arms
   (aerobic exercise, resistance training and combined training groups,
   non-active control group) and measurements will be completed pre- and
   post-intervention. The exercise groups will receive an individualised
   supervised exercise programme for 3x sessions/week for 12 weeks. The
   change in mean values before and after intervention will be calculated
   for primary and secondary outcomes. ANOVA and t-tests will be applied to
   evaluate within-group and between-group differences. If sufficient
   participants are recruited, the data will be analysed using ANCOVA with
   the age and BMI as covariates.
   Discussion: This pilot will provide data on the feasibility and
   acceptability of trial procedures and of the programmes' three
   progressive time-matched exercise interventions (aerobic, resistance and
   combined) for women living with obesity, which will help inform future
   research and the potential development of a full-scale randomised
   clinical trial.},

Abstract = {Background Early interventions to support young children's language
   development through responsive parent-child interaction have proven
   efficacy but are not currently delivered universally. A potential
   universal delivery platform is the Health Visitor (HV)-led
   2-21/2-year-old review in England's Healthy Child Programme. It is
   unclear if it is feasible to offer such interventions through this
   platform. We report an intervention development process, including
   extensive stakeholder consultation and co-design which aimed to develop
   an acceptable, feasible and equitable early language intervention for
   delivery in this context. Methods The study involved five phases
   including 13 stakeholder co-design workshops with 7 parents and 39
   practitioners (HVs, early years practitioners and speech and language
   therapists): (1) Identification of existing intervention evidence, (2)
   qualitative review of intervention studies extracting candidate target
   behaviours for intervention and intervention techniques, (3) co-design
   workshops with parents and practitioners examining acceptability,
   barriers and enablers to those behaviours and techniques (particular
   attention was paid to diverse family circumstances and the range of
   barriers which might exist), (4) findings were analysed using COM-B and
   theoretical domains frameworks and a prototype intervention model
   designed, and (5) co-design workshops iteratively refined the proposed
   model. Results Practitioners were committed to offering language
   intervention at the 2-21/2-year-old review but were not sure precisely
   how to do so. Parents/caregivers wanted to be proactive and to have
   agency in supporting their own children and to do this as soon as
   possible. For equitable intervention, it must be proportionate, with
   higher `intensity' for higher levels of disadvantage, and tailored,
   offering differing approaches considering the specific barriers and
   enablers, assets and challenges in each family. The importance and
   potential fragility of alliances between parent/caregiver and
   practitioner were identified as key, and so, strategies to engender
   successful collaborative partnership are also embedded in intervention
   design. Conclusion It is possible to develop a universal intervention
   which parents and practitioners judge would be acceptable, feasible and
   equitable for use at the 2-21/2-year review to promote children's
   language development. The result is one of the most explicitly developed
   universal interventions to promote children's language development.
   Further development and piloting is required to develop materials to
   support successful widespread implementation.},

Title = {`Playlist for Life' at the end of life: a mixed-methods feasibility
   study of a personalised music listening intervention in the hospice
   setting},

Abstract = {Background Playlist for Life is a brief, inexpensive music listening
   intervention which originated in dementia care, but is increasingly
   being used for people at the end of life. However, there is a lack of
   robust empirical research on its application in the hospice setting. Our
   patient and public involvement group originated the idea for this study.
   The aim of this feasibility study was to inform the design of a larger
   effectiveness study on the use of Playlist for Life in the hospice
   setting. Method This study was a mixed-methods feasibility study
   involving adults at the end of life, family members and hospice staff
   from one in-patient hospice in Scotland. Eligible patient/family member
   dyads were approached by hospice staff and if interested, recruited by
   the researcher. All included participants received the intervention,
   which involved the provision of an MP3 player and assistance to set up a
   playlist. Participants were asked to listen to the playlist daily during
   the intervention period (7 days). Data were collected through patient
   reported outcome measures and on days 1, 3 and 7 of the intervention
   period and through participant observation session. Patient/family
   member dyads and hospice staff also took part in qualitative interviews
   (Appendix 1) post-intervention, which were audio-recorded, transcribed
   and analysed thematically. Semi-structured interviews at the end of the
   intervention period were used to evaluate feasibility and acceptability.
   An advisory group including patients, family members and staff gave
   helpful feedback on the qualitative interview questions. Interview
   questions were the same for all participants and all the questions were
   asked to all participants. Results N = 15 participants were recruited (n
   = 5 patients, n = 5 family, n = 5 staff. The intervention was appraised
   positively, particularly regarding its beneficial effect on
   patient/family relationships. The study design was deemed feasible and
   acceptable. Conclusion The findings of this study will inform the
   development of a future randomised cluster trial designed to assess the
   usability and effectiveness of the Playlist for Life personalised music
   intervention.},

   on scaling-up childhood obesity interventions},

Abstract = {Background Pilot/feasibility studies play an important role in the
   development and refinement of behavioral interventions by providing
   information about feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy.
   Despite their importance and wide-spread use, the approaches taken by
   behavioral scientists to scale-up early-stage studies to larger-scale
   trials has received little attention. The aim of our study was to
   understand the role that pilot studies play in the development and
   execution of larger-scale trials. Methods We conducted interviews with
   childhood obesity researchers who had published pilot behavioral
   interventions and larger-scale trials of the same or similar
   interventions. Questions were asked about the role of pilot studies in
   developing larger-scale trials and the challenges encountered when
   scaling-up an intervention based upon pilot findings. Data were coded
   and analyzed using an inductive analytic approach to identify themes.
   Results Twenty-four interventionists (54\% women, 37-70 years old, mean
   20 years since terminal degree) completed a total of 148 pilot studies
   across their careers (mean 6.4, range 1-20), of which 59\% were
   scaled-up. Scaling was described as resource intensive and pilot work
   was considered essential to successfully competing for funding by 63\%
   of the sample (n = 15). When asked to define a high-quality pilot study,
   interventionists described studies that allowed them to evaluate two
   independent factors: components of their intervention (e.g.,
   acceptability, feasibility) and study parameters (e.g., sample size,
   measures). Interventionists expressed that more process implementation
   measures, different study designs, and additional iterations could
   improve decisions to scale-up. Most agreed that pilot studies were
   likely to produce inflated estimates of potential efficacy though only
   nine interventionists provided potential solutions for decreasing
   inflated measures of efficacy. Suggested major causes of inflated
   effects included high levels of oversight in pilot studies (e.g.,
   researcher support), reliance on subjective measures, and utilizing
   convenience or highly motivated samples. Potential solutions included
   designing pilots for real-world implementation, only conducting
   randomized controlled pilot studies, and pre-registering pilot studies.
   Conclusions Pilot studies purposes are multifaceted and deemed essential
   to obtaining funding for larger-scale trials. Clarifying the form and
   function of preliminary, early-stage research may enhance the productive
   utilization of early-stage studies and reduced drops in efficacy when
   transitioning to larger scale studies.},

Abstract = {Background: Children and youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may
   manifest self-injurious behaviors (SIB) that may become severe and
   refractory with limited pharmacologic or behavioral treatment options.
   Here, we present the protocol of a prospective, mixed-methods study to
   assess the safety and efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the
   nucleus accumbens (NAcc) for children and youth with ASD and severe,
   refractory SIB.
   Methods: This is a prospective, single-center, single-cohort,
   open-label, non-randomized pilot trial of 6 patients. Participants will
   be recruited through specialized behavioral clinics with persistent
   severe and refractory SIB following standard and intensive
   interventions. Following NAcc-DBS, participants will be enrolled in the
   study for 12 months. The primary objectives of the study are safety and
   feasibility, assessed by rate of recruitment and identification of
   factors impacting adherence to follow-up and study protocol. Potential
   treatment efficacy will be assessed by changes in the Children's
   Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale in ASD (CYBOCS-ASD), the Behavior
   Problems Index (BPI), the Inventory of Statements about Self-Injury
   (ISAS) and the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) questionnaires.
   Additional clinical outcomes will be assessed, including measures of
   participant and caregiver quality of life, actigraph measurements, and
   positron emission tomography (PET) changes following DBS.
   Discussion: This study will be the first to evaluate the effect of DBS
   of the NAcc on a pediatric population in a controlled, prospective
   trial. Secondary outcomes will improve the understanding of behavioral,
   neuro-imaging, and electrophysiologic changes in children with ASD and
   SIB treated with DBS. This trial will provide an estimated effect size
   of NAcc-DBS for severe refractory SIB in children with ASD in
   preparation for future comparative trials.},

Title = {Feasibility of deploying peer coaches to mentor frontline home health
   aides and promote mobility among individuals recovering from a stroke:
   pilot test of a randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Background: Each year, approximately 100,000 individuals receive home
   health services after a stroke. Evidence has shown the benefits of
   home-based stroke rehabilitation, but little is known about
   resource-efficient ways to enhance its effectiveness, nor has anyone
   explored the value of leveraging low-cost home health aides (HHAs) to
   reinforce repetitive task training, a key component of home-based
   rehabilitation. We developed and piloted a Stroke Home-health Aide
   Recovery Program (SHARP) that deployed specially trained HHAs as{''}peer
   coaches{''}to mentor frontline aides and help individuals recovering
   from stroke increase their mobility through greater adherence to
   repetitive exercise regimens. We assessed the feasibility of SHARP and
   its readiness for a full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT).
   Specifically, we examined (1) the practicability of recruitment and
   randomization procedures, (2) program acceptability, (3) intervention
   fidelity, and (4) the performance of outcome measures.
   Methods: This was a feasibility study including a pilot RCT. Target
   enrollment was 60 individuals receiving post-stroke home health
   services, who were randomized to SHARP + usual home care or usual care
   only. The protocol specified a 30-day intervention with four planned
   in-home coach visits, including one joint coach/physical therapist
   visit. The primary participant outcome was 60-day change in mobility,
   using the performance-based Timed Up and Go and 4-Meter Walk Gait Speed
   tests. Interviews with participants, coaches, physical therapists, and
   frontline aides provided acceptability data. Enrollment figures, visit
   tracking reports, and audio recordings provided intervention fidelity
   data. Mixed methods included thematic analysis of qualitative data and
   quantitative analysis of structured data to examine the intervention
   feasibility and performance of outcome measures.
   Results: Achieving the 60-participant enrollment target required
   modifying participant eligibility criteria to accommodate a decline in
   the receipt of HHA services among individuals receiving home care after
   a stroke. This modification entailed intervention redesign.
   Acceptability was high among coaches and participants but lower among
   therapists and frontline aides. Intervention fidelity was mixed: 87\% of
   intervention participants received all four planned coach visits;
   however, no joint coach/therapist visits occurred. Sixty-day follow-up
   retention was 78\%. However, baseline and follow-up performance-based
   primary outcome mobility assessments could be completed for only 55\% of
   participants.
   Conclusions: The trial was not feasible in its current form. Before
   progressing to a definitive trial, significant program redesign would be
   required to address issues affecting enrollment, coach/HHA/therapist
   coordination, and implementation of performance-based outcome measures.},

Title = {The READ-IT study protocol for a feasibility randomised controlled trial
   of using a support worker/family carer mediated online reading programme
   to teach early reading skills to adults with intellectual disabilities},

Abstract = {Background: Many individuals with intellectual disability (ID) have not
   learnt basic reading skills by the time that they reach adulthood,
   potentially limiting their access to critical information. READ-IT is an
   online reading programme developed from the Headsprout (R) Early Reading
   (HER (R)) intervention and supplemented by support strategies tailored
   for adults with ID. HER (R) has been successfully used to teach adults
   with ID to read in a forensic setting by trained staff. The aim of this
   study is to assess the feasibility of delivering READ-IT to adults with
   ID by family carers/support workers and will assess whether it would be
   feasible to conduct a later definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT)
   of the effectiveness of the programme. The study will aim to contribute
   to the evidence base on improving outcomes for adults with ID and their
   caregivers.
   Methods: This study is a feasibility RCT, with embedded process
   evaluation. Forty-eight adults with ID will be recruited and allocated
   to intervention: control on a 1:1 basis. Intervention families will be
   offered the READ-IT programme immediately, continuing to receive usual
   practice and control participants will be offered the opportunity to
   receive READ-IT at the end of the trial follow-up period and will
   continue to receive usual practice. Data will be collected at baseline
   and 6 months post-randomisation.
   Discussion: The results of this study will inform a potential future
   definitive trial, to evaluate the effectiveness of READ-IT to improve
   reading skills. Such a trial would have significant scientific impact
   internationally in the intellectual disability field.},

Abstract = {Background: Anticipatory care is becoming increasingly important in
   effectively managing complex multimorbidity in aging populations,
   preventing further functional decline, and avoiding hospital admissions.
   This study aimed to elicit the feedback of participating general
   practitioners, practice managers, nurses and an adjunct pharmacist on
   the implementation strengths and limitations of a nurse-led,
   person-centered anticipatory care planning (ACP) intervention for older
   people at risk of functional decline in a primary care setting. The
   findings have implications for a full trial and intervention design.
   Methods: As part of a feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial
   (cRCT) testing the ACP intervention, we sought feedback from
   implementing stakeholders: general practitioners (N = 3), practice staff
   (N = 3), research nurses (N = 5), and adjunct pharmacist (N = 1) in both
   the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland (NI), UK. Following
   written, informed consent, they were interviewed to investigate their
   experience of participating in the implementation of the ACP
   intervention as part of the feasibility trial, and elicit any
   recommendations for a full trial. Using the Consolidated Framework for
   Implementation Research, thematic analysis was employed to analyze data.
   The intervention consisted of home visits by specially trained nurses
   who assessed participants' health, discussed with them their health
   goals and plans, and devised an anticipatory care plan following
   consultation with participants' General Practitioners and the adjunct
   clinical pharmacist.
   Results: Participating stakeholders indicated that the strengths of the
   implementation process included the training provided to the nurses,
   constructive collaboration of the research team, and structure of
   implementation process. Perceived limitations included the selection
   process and screening tool, communication between the research team and
   the nurses, the assessment questionnaire, and the final document left
   with the patient, as well as lack of access to medical records for the
   adjunct pharmacist. Recommendations include better communication and
   team-wide consensus on alterations to procedure and documents, and
   standardized protocols for patient selection, data collection, and
   reporting for research nurses.
   Conclusions: The findings have identified strengths of the
   implementation process on which to build, and recognized limitations
   which can now be addressed to ensure improved efficiency and
   effectiveness in future trials.},

Title = {Development of GERAS DANcing for Cognition and Exercise (DANCE): a
   feasibility study},

Abstract = {Background Dance is a mind-body activity of purposeful rhythmic movement
   to music. There is growing interest in using dance as a form of
   cognitive and physical rehabilitation. This manuscript describes the
   development of GERAS DANcing for Cognition and Exercise (DANCE) and
   evaluates its feasibility in older adults with cognitive and mobility
   impairments. Methods The progressive dance curricula were delivered for
   15 weeks (1-h class; twice weekly). Participants were eligible if they
   were community-dwelling older adults aged 60+ with early cognitive or
   mobility impairment able to follow three-step commands and move
   independently. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment/retention,
   adherence, participant satisfaction, safety, and adverse events. Results
   Twenty-five older adults (mean (standard deviation {[}SD]) age = 77.55
   (6.10) years, range 68-90 years) with early cognitive (Montreal
   Cognitive Assessment score (SD) = 21.77 (4.05)) and mobility (92\% were
   pre-frail/frail as indicated on the Fried Frailty Phenotype) impairments
   were recruited from a geriatric out-patient clinic or within the
   community. A total of 20/25 (80\%) participants completed the study.
   Average class attendance was 72\%, and self-reported homework adherence
   ``most-days / every day{''} was 89\%. A stepwise progression in the
   dance curricula was observed with increases in motor complexity and
   balance demands, and 95\% of participants rated the program as a
   ``just-right{''} challenge. Ninety percent of participants rated GERAS
   DANCE as excellent, and 100\% would recommend the program to a friend or
   family member. Over 50\% of participants connected outside of class time
   for a self-initiated coffee club. Adverse events of falls and fractures
   were reported for 2 participants, which occurred at home unrelated to
   the dance intervention during the study period. Pre-determined
   thresholds for feasibility were met for all outcomes. Discussion GERAS
   DANCE is a feasible and enjoyable program for older adults with early
   cognitive or mobility impairments. GERAS DANCE curriculum grading
   (duration; sequence; instructions) and motor complexity increases in
   agility, balance, and coordination appear appropriately tailored for
   this population. Future work will explore the feasibility of GERAS DANCE
   in new settings (i.e., virtually online, community centers, or
   retirement homes) and the mind-body-social benefits of dance.},

Abstract = {Background: In the UK, there is evidence that girls' physical activity
   tends to decline to a greater extent than boys as they enter
   adolescence. `Role models' could play a vital role in inspiring girls to
   become or remain physically active. The CHARMING Programme is a primary
   school-based community linked role-model programme, co-developed in
   2016, with children, parents, schools and wider stakeholders. It
   involves different types of physical activity delivered for 1-h each
   week by a community provider and peer role models (e.g. older girls from
   secondary schools) joining in with the sessions. The programme
   ultimately aims to increase and sustain physical activity levels among
   9-10-year-old girls. This study aims to assess the feasibility and
   acceptability of the CHARMING Programme and of evaluating it using a
   randomised trial.
   Methods: This study is a feasibility cluster randomised controlled
   trial, with embedded process evaluation and health economic evaluation.
   Approximately 90 Year 5 (i.e. 9-10-year-old) girls will be recruited
   across six primary schools in Mid-South Wales. Participating schools
   will be allocated to the programme: control on a 2:1 basis; four
   intervention schools will run the CHARMING Programme and two will
   continue with usual practice. A survey and accelerometer will be
   administered at baseline and repeated at 12 months. Interviews and focus
   groups will be conducted post-intervention delivery. The primary aim is
   to assess feasibility of a future randomised trial via the recruitment
   of schools, participants and role models; randomisation; retention;
   reach; data collection completion rates; programme adherence; and
   programme fidelity, views on intervention acceptability and programme
   barriers and facilitators. Secondary aims are to evaluate established
   physical activity outcome measures for children plus additional health
   economic outcomes for inclusion in a future full-scale trial.
   Discussion: The results of this study will inform decisions on whether
   and how to proceed to a full-scale evaluation of the effectiveness and
   cost-effectiveness of the CHARMING Programme to improve or sustain
   physical activity.},

Title = {Feasibility and acceptability of transcranial stimulation in

   (tDCS) in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)},

Abstract = {Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric
   disorder which often proves refractory to current treatment approaches.
   Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive form of
   neurostimulation, with potential for development as a self-administered
   intervention, has shown potential as a safe and efficacious treatment
   for OCD in a small number of trials. The two most promising stimulation
   sites are located above the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the
   supplementary motor area (SMA).
   Methods: The aim of this feasibility study is to inform the development
   of a definitive trial, focussing on the acceptability, safety of the
   intervention, feasibility of recruitment, adherence and tolerability to
   tDCS and study assessments and the size of the treatment effect. To this
   end, we will deliver a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover
   randomised multicentre study in 25 adults with OCD. Each participant
   will receive three courses of tDCS (SMA, OFC and sham), randomly
   allocated and given in counterbalanced order. Each course comprises four
   20-min stimulations, delivered over two consecutive days, separated by
   at least 4 weeks' washout period. We will collect information about
   recruitment, study conduct and tDCS delivery. Blinded raters will assess
   clinical outcomes before, during and up to 4 weeks after stimulation
   using validated scales. We will include relevant objective
   neurocognitive tasks, testing cognitive flexibility, motor
   disinhibition, cooperation and habit learning.
   Discussion: We will analyse the magnitude of the effect of the
   interventions on OCD symptoms alongside the standard deviation of the
   outcome measure, to estimate effect size and determine the optimal
   stimulation target. We will also measure the duration of the effect of
   stimulation, to provide information on spacing treatments efficiently.
   We will evaluate the usefulness and limitations of specific
   neurocognitive tests to determine a definitive test battery.
   Additionally, qualitative data will be collected from participants to
   better understand their experience of taking part in a tDCS
   intervention, as well as the impact on their overall quality of life.
   These clinical outcomes will enable the project team to further refine
   the methodology to ensure optimal efficiency in terms of both delivering
   and assessing the treatment in a full-scale trial.},

Abstract = {Background Pilot studies are essential in determining if a larger study
   is feasible. This is especially true when targeting populations that
   experience stigma and may be difficult to include in research, such as
   people with HIV. We sought to describe how pilot studies have been used
   to inform HIV clinical trials. Methods We conducted a methodological
   study of pilot studies of interventions in people living with HIV
   published until November 25, 2020, using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane
   Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL). We extracted data on their
   nomenclature, primary objective, use of progression criteria, sample
   size, use of qualitative methods, and other contextual information
   (region, income, level, type of intervention, study design). Results Our
   search retrieved 10,597 studies, of which 248 were eligible. The number
   of pilot studies increased steadily over time. We found that 179 studies
   (72.2\%) used the terms ``pilot{''} or ``feasibility{''} in their title,
   65.3\% tested feasibility as a primary objective, only 2\% used
   progression criteria, 23.9\% provided a sample size estimation and only
   30.2\% used qualitative methods. Conclusions Pilot studies are
   increasingly being used to inform HIV research. However, the titles and
   objectives are not always consistent with piloting. The design and
   reporting of pilot studies in HIV could be improved.},

Title = {Potential efficacy of parent-infant psychotherapy with mothers and their
   infants from a high-risk population: a randomized controlled pilot trial},

Abstract = {Background: Psychotherapy of mother-child dyads is an intervention which
   was developed to prevent maltreatment and negative children's
   development. There is a lack of good-quality research investigating
   psychotherapeutic interventions and social care for mothers at high-risk
   living in Mother-Child Facilities in Germany. The present randomized
   controlled pilot trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate the need for
   parent-infant psychotherapy (PIP) and to explore its impact on the
   mother-infant relationship. Primary feasibility objectives were
   recruitment and attrition, with potential efficacy defined as the
   secondary feasibility objective.
   Methods: This pilot RCT focused on (young) mothers with cumulative risk
   factors and their infants under 7 months of age living in Mother-Child
   Facilities. N=32 mother-child dyads were randomly allocated to PIP or
   Care as usual (CAU). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6
   months of intervention. The primary potential efficacy outcome was
   maternal sensitivity. Secondary outcomes were maternal mental health
   problems, reflective functioning, parenting stress, personality
   organization, infant's development, and attachment.
   Results: At baseline, all mothers showed low levels of emotional
   availability, but results revealed improvements in sensitivity, mental
   health problems, stress, and depressive symptomatology favoring PIP
   after 6 months. Positive developments in maternal sensitivity, a healthy
   aspect of mother-child interaction, were only found in the PIP group.
   Overall attrition was high at 6 months. Some evidence of fewer
   depressive symptoms and lower maternal distress after 6 months of
   PIP-intervention exists that did not reach significance.
   Conclusion: Findings revealed improvements in the mother's well-being
   for both groups, but PIP had a higher impact on the mother-child dyad.
   In sum, there is some evidence that PIP may represent an effective
   intervention offer besides the social and pedagogical support in these
   facilities, but further research is demanded.},

Title = {A study protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility trial of an
   intervention to increase activity and reduce sedentary behaviour in
   people with severe mental illness: Walking fOR Health (WORtH) Study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Background: People with severe mental illness (SMI) are less physically
   active and more sedentary than healthy controls, contributing to poorer
   physical health outcomes in this population. There is a need to
   understand the feasibility and acceptability, and explore the effective
   components, of health behaviour change interventions targeting physical
   activity and sedentary behaviour in this population in rural and
   semi-rural settings.
   Methods: This 13-week randomised controlled feasibility trial compares
   the Walking fOR Health (WORtH) multi-component behaviour change
   intervention, which includes education, goal-setting and
   self-monitoring, with a one-off education session. It aims to recruit 60
   inactive adults with SMI via three community mental health teams in
   Ireland and Northern Ireland. Primary outcomes are related to
   feasibility and acceptability, including recruitment, retention and
   adherence rates, adverse events and qualitative feedback from
   participants and clinicians. Secondary outcome measures include
   self-reported and accelerometer-measured physical activity and sedentary
   behaviour, anthropometry measures, physical function and mental
   wellbeing. A mixed-methods process evaluation will be undertaken. This
   study protocol outlines changes to the study in response to the COVID-19
   pandemic.
   Discussion: This study will address the challenges and implications of
   remote delivery of the WORtH intervention due to the COVID-19 pandemic
   and inform the design of a future definitive randomised controlled trial
   if it is shown to be feasible.},

Abstract = {Background We aimed to establish what core elements were required in a
   group therapy programme for men who disclose perpetrating intimate
   partner abuse in a substance use setting and develop, and test the
   feasibility of delivering an intervention in this setting. Methods We
   describe the theoretical development and feasibility testing of an
   integrated substance use and intimate partner abuse intervention
   ('ADVANCE') for delivery in substance use services. We employed a
   comprehensive eight-stage process to guide this development applying the
   `COM-B' ('capability', `opportunity', `motivation' and `behaviour')
   model for intervention design which specifies the following: (1) define
   the problem, (2) select the target behaviour, (3) specify the target
   behaviour, (4) identify what needs to change, (5) identify intervention
   functions, (6) identify policy categories, (7) select behaviour change
   techniques, and (8) design a mode of delivery. The development was
   informed by primary research conducted by the authors, consulting with
   organisation steering groups and by those with personal experiences. The
   identified targets for intervention and mode and method of delivery were
   then refined over 4 intervention development meetings, using the nominal
   group technique with the ADVANCE experts, then further refined following
   consultation with service user groups and wider expert groups via a
   learning alliance meetings. Results Our final intervention, the ADVANCE
   intervention consisted of a group intervention comprising of up to four
   pre-group individual interviews, followed by 12 x 2-h group sessions
   supported by integrated safety work for victim/survivors, and risk and
   safety support and integrity support for the professionals. The main
   targets for change were personal goal planning, self-regulation, and
   attitudes and beliefs supporting intimate partner abuse. The
   intervention was regarded as very acceptable to both staff and clients
   in substance use services, with group attendees reported positive
   behaviour changes and development of new skills. Conclusion We have
   demonstrated the ability to employ a structured eight-step process to
   develop an integrated intervention to address substance use-related
   intimate partner abuse that is acceptable to staff and clients in
   substance use services. This led to a feasibility study (ISRCTN
   79435190) involving 104 men and 30 staff at three different locations
   across the UK was conducted to assess the feasibility and acceptability
   of the intervention and to refine the content and approach to delivery
   (BMC Public Health, 21: 980, 2021).},

Title = {Facilitating treatment engagement for early psychosis through
   peer-delivered decision support: intervention development and protocol
   for pilot evaluation},

Abstract = {Background: Emerging adults with early psychosis demonstrate high rates
   of service disengagement from critical early intervention services.
   Decision support interventions and peer support have both been shown to
   enhance service engagement but are understudied in this population. The
   purposes of this article are to describe the development of a novel
   peer-delivered decision coaching intervention for this population and to
   report plans for a pilot study designed to gather preliminary data about
   its feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact.
   Methods: The intervention was developed based on formative qualitative
   data and in collaboration with a diverse team of researchers, key
   stakeholders, and expert consultants. The pilot trial will utilize a
   single-group (N = 20), prepost, convergent mixed-methods design to
   explore whether and how the intervention addresses decision-making needs
   (the primary intervention target). The impact of the intervention on
   secondary outcomes (e.g., engagement in the program) will also be
   assessed. Additionally, through observation and feedback from the peer
   decision coach and study participants, we will evaluate the feasibility
   of research and intervention procedures, and the acceptability of
   information and support from the peer decision coach.
   Discussion: The peer-delivered decision coaching intervention holds
   promise for assisting young people with making informed and
   values-consistent decisions about their care, and potentially enhancing
   service engagement within this traditionally difficult-to-engage
   population. If the intervention demonstrates feasibility and
   acceptability, and pilot data show its potential for improving treatment
   decision-making, our work will also lay the foundation for a new
   evidence base regarding roles for peer specialists on early intervention
   teams.},

Title = {Strategies for Empowering activities in Everyday life (SEE 1.0): study
   protocol for a feasibility study of an Internet-based occupational
   therapy intervention for people with stroke},

Abstract = {Background: Rehabilitation after stroke seldom focuses on needs related
   to an active everyday life and the process of change that people must
   undergo to adapt to an altered capacity and life situation. In
   particular, occupational therapy in the late phase needs to support
   clients in adopting sustainable self-initiated management strategies to
   regain daily activities and an active everyday life. To improve access
   to rehabilitation, the use of digital solutions has been suggested. This
   study aims to evaluate the feasibility of the Internet-based
   occupational therapy intervention ``Strategies for Empowering activities
   in Everyday life{''} (SEE, version 1.0). We will investigate the
   feasibility of the intervention process in terms of acceptability and
   adherence as well as the most suitable outcome measures to evaluate SEE
   and improve the knowledge about the potential changes and outcomes of
   SEE for clients with stroke.
   Methods: This feasibility study is based on a pretest posttest design
   without a control group. Quantitative and qualitative data will be
   collected from clients and staff concurrently embedded in a mixed-method
   design during the entire study.
   Discussion: The project is a first test of a novel Internet-based
   occupational therapy intervention, and the research will contribute to
   the continued development and evaluation of the SEE programme. SEE can
   provide people with strategies in daily activities that can support them
   to live an active everyday life despite changed capacity and to improve

Title = {Small studies, big decisions: the role of pilot/feasibility studies in
   incremental science and premature scale-up of behavioral interventions},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Background: Careful consideration and planning are required to establish
   ``sufficient{''} evidence to ensure an investment in a larger, more
   well-powered behavioral intervention trial is worthwhile. In the
   behavioral sciences, this process typically occurs where smaller-scale
   studies inform larger-scale trials. Believing that one can do the same
   things and expect the same outcomes in a larger-scale trial that were
   done in a smaller-scale preliminary study (i.e., pilot/feasibility) is
   wishful thinking, yet common practice. Starting small makes sense, but
   small studies come with big decisions that can influence the usefulness
   of the evidence designed to inform decisions about moving forward with a
   larger-scale trial. The purpose of this commentary is to discuss what
   may constitute sufficient evidence for moving forward to a definitive
   trial. The discussion focuses on challenges often encountered when
   conducting pilot/feasibility studies, referred to as common (mis)steps,
   that can lead to inflated estimates of both feasibility and efficacy,
   and how the intentional design and execution of one or more, often
   small, pilot/feasibility studies can play a central role in developing
   an intervention that scales beyond a highly localized context.
   Main body: Establishing sufficient evidence to support larger-scale,
   definitive trials, from smaller studies, is complicated. For any given
   behavioral intervention, the type and amount of evidence necessary to be
   deemed sufficient is inherently variable and can range anywhere from
   qualitative interviews of individuals representative of the target
   population to a small-scale randomized trial that mimics the anticipated
   larger-scale trial. Major challenges and common (mis)steps in the
   execution of pilot/feasibility studies discussed are those focused on
   selecting the right sample size, issues with scaling, adaptations and
   their influence on the preliminary feasibility and efficacy estimates
   observed, as well as the growing pains of progressing from small to
   large samples. Finally, funding and resource constraints for conducting
   informative pilot/feasibility study(ies) are discussed.
   Conclusion: Sufficient evidence to scale will always remain in the eye
   of the beholder. An understanding of how to design informative small
   pilot/feasibility studies can assist in speeding up incremental science
   (where everything needs to be piloted) while slowing down premature
   scale-up (where any evidence is sufficient for scaling).},

Abstract = {Background By 2050, worldwide dementia prevalence is expected to triple.
   Affordable, scalable interventions are required to support protective
   behaviours such as physical activity, cognitive training and healthy
   eating. This paper outlines the theory-, evidence- and person-based
   development of `Active Brains': a multi-domain digital behaviour change
   intervention to reduce cognitive decline amongst older adults. Methods
   During the initial planning phase, scoping reviews, consultation with
   PPI contributors and expert co-investigators and behavioural analysis
   collated and recorded evidence that was triangulated to inform
   provisional `guiding principles' and an intervention logic model. The
   following optimisation phase involved qualitative think aloud and
   semi-structured interviews with 52 older adults with higher and lower
   cognitive performance scores. Data were analysed thematically and
   informed changes and additions to guiding principles, the behavioural
   analysis and the logic model which, in turn, informed changes to
   intervention content. Results Scoping reviews and qualitative interviews
   suggested that the same intervention content may be suitable for
   individuals with higher and lower cognitive performance. Qualitative
   findings revealed that maintaining independence and enjoyment motivated
   engagement in intervention-targeted behaviours, whereas managing ill
   health was a potential barrier. Social support for engaging in such
   activities could provide motivation, but was not desirable for all.
   These findings informed development of intervention content and
   functionality that appeared highly acceptable amongst a sample of target
   users. Conclusions A digitally delivered intervention with minimal
   support appears acceptable and potentially engaging to older adults with
   higher and lower levels of cognitive performance. As well as informing
   our own intervention development, insights obtained through this process
   may be useful for others working with, and developing interventions for,
   older adults and/or those with cognitive impairment.},

Title = {Posttraumatic stress disorder intervention for people with severe mental
   illness in a low-income country primary care setting: a randomized
   feasibility trial protocol},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Background: In this protocol, we outline a mixed-methods randomized
   feasibility trial of Brief Relaxation, Education and Trauma Healing
   (BREATHE) Ethiopia. BREATHE Ethiopia is a culturally and contextually
   adapted intervention for PTSD in participants with severe mental
   illness. BREATHE Ethiopia maps onto the World Health Organization's
   guidelines for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment in low-
   and middle-income country primary care settings.
   Methods: Specifically, this study includes a non-randomized pre-pilot (n
   = 5) and a randomized feasibility trial comparing BREATHE Ethiopia to
   Treatment as Usual (n = 40) to assess trial procedures, acceptability,
   and feasibility of intervention delivery, and investigate potential
   effectiveness and implementation. In a process evaluation, we will
   collect data that will be critical for a future fully randomized
   controlled trial, including the numbers of participants who are
   eligible, who consent, who engage in treatment, and who complete the
   assessments, as well as the feasibility and acceptability of assessments
   and the intervention. Qualitative data on facilitators and barriers to
   intervention delivery and quantitative data on provider fidelity to the
   intervention and participant and provider satisfaction will also be
   collected. Quantitative assessments at baseline, post-treatment, 1-month
   follow-up, and 3-month follow-up will assess change in mental health
   symptoms and functional impairment and hypothesized intervention
   mechanisms, including knowledge about PTSD, stigma, trauma-related
   cognitions, and physiological arousal.
   Discussion: Findings from this study will inform a future fully-powered
   randomized controlled trial, and if found to be effective, the
   intervention has the potential to be integrated into mental healthcare
   scale-up efforts in other low-resource settings.},

Title = {A feasibility trial of an intervention in alcohol dependence for
   structured preparation before detoxification versus usual care: the
   SPADe trial results},

Abstract = {Background: Individuals who are `moderately' or `severely' dependent
   consume alcohol at levels that are likely to have a severe impact on
   their own health and mortality, the health and behaviours of others
   (family members) and to have economic and social implications. Treatment
   guidelines suggest that treatment needs to be planned with medically
   assisted withdrawal (also referred to as detoxification), and aftercare
   support but outcomes are poor with low proportions engaging in after
   care and high relapse rates. An approach of structured preparation
   before alcohol detoxification (SPADe) puts an emphasis on introducing
   lifestyle changes, development of coping strategies for cravings, stress
   and emotions as well as introducing changes to the immediate family and
   social environment in advance of alcohol cessation. Such a
   pre-habilitation paradigm compliments the established treatment
   approach. The key research question was: can we design a large scale,
   randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will answer whether such an
   approach is more effective than usual care in helping individuals to
   maintain longer periods of alcohol abstinence?
   Methods: This is a pragmatic, parallel, two-arm, feasibility RCT
   comparing SPADe and usual care against usual care only in maintaining
   alcohol abstinence in adults with alcohol dependence receiving care in
   two community addiction services in London. Feasibility outcomes,
   exploration of primary and secondary clinical outcomes and health
   economic outcomes are analysed. The trial follows the guidelines of
   phase 2 of the Medical Research Council (MRC) for complex interventions.
   Results: We were able to recruit 48/50 participants during a period of 9
   months. Retention in the trial for the whole period of the 12 months was
   75\%. Treatment compliance was overall 44\%. Data completion for the
   primary outcome was 65\%, 50\% and 63\% at 3, 6 and 12 months,
   respectively. The intervention group had more days abstinent in the
   previous 90 days at the 12 months (n = 54.5) versus control (n = 41.5).
   Conclusions: The results of this feasibility trial indicate that with
   the appropriate modifications, a full multicentred trial would be
   possible to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a
   pre-habilitation approach such as the SPADe group intervention in
   addition to usual care against usual care only.},

Title = {Acceptability and feasibility of peer-administered group interpersonal
   therapy for depression for people living with HIV/AIDS-a pilot study in

Abstract = {BackgroundPsychological treatments are widely tested and have been
   effective in treating depressive symptoms. However, implementation of
   psychological treatments in the real world and in diverse populations
   remains difficult due to several interacting barriers. In this study, we
   assessed the acceptability and feasibility of peer-administered group
   interpersonal therapy for depressive symptoms among people living with
   HIV/AIDS in Northwest Ethiopia.MethodWe conducted a single-arm,
   peer-administered, group interpersonal therapy intervention with eight
   weekly sessions from 15 August to 15 December 2019 among people living
   with HIV/AIDS in Northwest Ethiopia. Four interpersonal therapy groups
   were formed for the intervention with a total of 31
   participants.ResultsOf the 31 recruited participants, 29 completed the
   intervention providing a retention rate of 93.5\%. The process of the
   intervention and its outcomes were highly acceptable as most
   participants expressed success in resolving their psychosocial problems,
   adjusting to life changes and coping with stigma. The intervention was
   also reported to be feasible despite anticipated barriers such as access
   to transportation, perceived stigma and confidentiality concerns. The
   post-intervention assessment revealed significant reduction in
   depressive symptoms (mean difference (MD)=9.92; t=-7.82; 95\%
   CI,-12.54,-7.31; p<0.001), improvement in perceived social support
   (MD=0.79; t=2.84; 95\% CI, 0.22, 1.37; p=0.009) and quality of life
   (MD=0.39; t=4.58; 95\% CI, 0.21, 0.56; p<0.001).ConclusionGroup
   interpersonal therapy is feasible and acceptable, and people living with
   HIV/AIDS can benefit from group interpersonal therapy in managing
   depressive symptoms and in improving perceived social support and
   quality of life. Future studies should examine the effectiveness of
   group interpersonal therapy in this setting.},

Title = {Feasibility study of the Home-based Exercises for Responsible Sex (HERS)
   intervention to promote correct and consistent condom use among young
   women},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background Male condoms are effective in preventing common sexually
   transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy, if used
   correctly and consistently. However, condom use errors and problems are
   common and young people report negative experiences, such as reduced
   pleasure. The Kinsey Institute Home-Based Exercises for Responsible Sex
   (KIHERS) is a novel condom promotion intervention for young women, which
   aims to reduce condom errors and problems, increase self-efficacy and
   improve attitudes towards condoms, using a pleasure-focussed approach.
   The study objective was to test the operability, viability and
   acceptability of an adapted version of the KIHERS intervention with
   young women aged 16-25 years in the United Kingdom (UK) (Home-Based
   Exercises for Responsible Sex-UK (HERS-UK). Methods A repeated-measures
   single-arm design was used, with a baseline (T1) and two follow-up
   assessments (T2 and T3), conducted 4 weeks and 8 weeks post intervention
   over a 3-month period. Participants were provided a condom kit
   containing different condoms and lubricants and were asked to experiment
   with condoms alone using a dildo and/or with a sexual partner. Ten
   process evaluation interviews were conducted post intervention. Results
   Fifty-five young women received the intervention; 36 (65\%) completed T2
   and 33 (60\%) completed T3. Condom use errors and problems decreased,
   self-efficacy increased and attitudes towards condoms improved
   significantly. The proportion of participants who reported using a
   condom for intercourse in the past 4 weeks increased from T1 (20; 47\%)
   to T2 (27; 87\%) and T3 (23; 77\%) and using lubricant with a condom for
   intercourse increased from T1 (6; 30\%) to T2 (13; 48\%)) and T3 (16;
   70\%). However, motivation to use condoms did not change. Cronbach's
   alpha scores indicated good internal consistency of measures used.
   Qualitative data provided strong evidence for the acceptability of the
   intervention. Conclusions HERS-UK was implemented as intended and the
   recruitment strategy was successful within a college/university setting.
   This feasibility study provided an early indication of the potential
   effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention, and the benefits of
   using a pleasure-focussed approach with young women. Measures used
   captured change in outcome variables and were deemed fit for purpose.
   Future research should explore cost-effectiveness of this intervention,
   in a large-scale controlled trial using a diverse sample and targeting
   young women most at risk of STIs.},

Abstract = {BackgroundConduct disorder (CD) is a complex mental disorder
   characterized by severe rule-breaking and aggressive behavior. While
   studies have shown that several therapeutic interventions are effective
   in treating CD symptoms, researchers call for treatments based on
   etiological knowledge and potential patho-mechanisms.
   Mentalization-based treatment (MBT) may represent such a treatment
   approach: Studies have shown that individuals with CD show mentalizing
   deficits and that mentalizing might represent a protective factor
   against the development of the disorder. As MBT focuses on the
   understanding of social behavior in terms of mental states, fostering
   mentalizing might help CD individuals to (re)gain an adaptive way of
   coping with negative emotions especially in social interactions and thus
   reduce aggressive behavior. For this purpose, MBT was adapted for
   adolescents with CD (MBT-CD). This is a protocol of a feasibility and
   pilot study to inform the planning of a prospective RCT. The primary aim
   is to estimate the feasibility of an RCT based on the acceptability of
   the intervention and the scientific assessments by CD individuals and
   their families indicated by quantitative and qualitative data, as well
   as based on necessary organizational resources to conduct an RCT. The
   secondary aim is to investigate the course of symptom severity and
   mentalizing skills.MethodsThe bi-center study is carried out in two
   outpatient settings associated with university hospitals (Heidelberg and
   Mainz) in Germany. Adolescents aged between 11 and 18 years with a CD or
   oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) diagnosis are included. Participants
   receive MBT-CD for 6 to 12 months. The primary outcome of the
   feasibility study (e.g., recruitment and adherence rates) will be
   descriptively analyzed. Multilevel modeling will be used to investigate
   secondary outcome data.DiscussionFostering the capacity to mentalize
   social interactions triggering non-mentalized, aggressive behavior might
   help CD individuals to behave more adaptively. The feasibility trial is
   essential for gathering information on how to properly conduct MBT-CD
   including appropriate scientific assessments in this patient group, in
   order to subsequently investigate the effectiveness of MBT-CD in an
   RCT.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02988453. November 30,

   Disorder. This manualized psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on
   increasing mentalizing, i.e., the ability to understand behavior in
   terms of mental states, in patients. MBT-CD includes weekly individual
   sessions with the patient and monthly family sessions.

Abstract = {Background Development of physical literacy, defined as ``the
   motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding
   to value and take responsibility for engagement in physical activities
   for life,{''} can support children's physically active behaviors and
   consequent health benefits. Little research has explored interventions
   to improve children's physical literacy, although substantive evidence
   shows parents play a key role in children's physically active behaviors
   and development of fundamental movement skills. The purpose of this
   study was to explore the feasibility of a novel, physical literacy
   program (the PLAYshop) designed to build parents' self-efficacy to
   support their child's physical literacy. Methods A non-randomized,
   one-arm concurrent nested design was used. Thirty-five parents of young
   children (3-8 years of age) attended a 75-min workshop inclusive of
   interactive activities, educational messages, and the provision of
   resources focused on core physical literacy concepts. Pre- and
   post-workshop surveys used quantitative measures to assess parents'
   satisfaction, knowledge, confidence, and intention to adopt practices.
   Follow-up interviews qualitatively explored the implementation
   experiences of both parents and facilitators. Paired t tests and
   thematic analysis were undertaken. Results Of the 33 eligible parents,
   23 completed both pre- and post-workshop surveys. Follow-up interviews
   were completed with 11 parents and four workshop facilitators. Parents'
   self-reported knowledge and confidence to support their child's physical
   literacy development significantly increased after PLAYshop
   participation. The majority of parents were satisfied with the workshop
   and motivated to apply learnings at home with their child. Workshop
   facilitators identified seven workshop strengths (e.g., workshop
   champions and skilled facilitators) and four challenges (e.g.,
   recruitment and unfavorable spaces). Limitations include the lack of
   control group and recruitment challenges. Conclusions The PLAYshop was
   perceived positively by parents and facilitators and appeared to improve
   parent self-efficacy and intention to promote physical literacy with
   their child. Recruitment and attendance were key implementation
   challenges. The findings from this real-world study support the
   preliminary feasibility of the PLAYshop intervention and highlight areas
   to improve the intervention and recruitment prior to efficacy testing in
   a more rigorous trial format.},

Abstract = {Background: We have co-designed a tailored blended physiotherapy
   intervention for people with progressive multiple sclerosis (PwPMS) who
   often struggle to access support for physical activity. Underpinned by
   self-management principles, the Lifestyle, Exercise and Activity Package
   for people with Multiple Sclerosis (LEAP-MS) intervention incorporates
   face-to-face or online physiotherapy coaching sessions with an
   accompanying online physical activity platform. The LEAP-MS platform is
   a multi-user system enabling user and physiotherapist to co-create
   activity plans. The LEAP-MS platform consists of an information and
   activity suite, interactive components enabling selection of exercises
   into an activity programme, goal setting and activity logging. The
   platform also facilitates online remote support from a physiotherapist
   through an embedded online messaging function. We aim to evaluate the
   LEAP-MS platform in a feasibility trial.
   Methods: LEAP-MS will be evaluated within a single-arm feasibility study
   with embedded process evaluation. After registration and initial
   eligible screening, 21 participants will be required to complete
   baseline self-completion measures. This will be followed by an initial
   home-based or online coaching session with a physiotherapist (who has
   received tailored self-management and digital resource training) and
   access to the online intervention for an initial 3-month period. During
   this period, participants are given the option to request up to five
   further home-based or online physiotherapy coaching sessions. Follow-up
   questionnaires and semi-structured interviews will be administered 3
   months after baseline with participants and intervention
   physiotherapists. The LEAP-MS platform will be available to participants
   for a further 3 months. Usage of the LEAP-MS platform will be tracked
   during the full 6-month period and final follow-up will be conducted 6
   months after baseline.
   Discussion: Feasibility outcomes (recruitment, retention, intervention
   uptake and safety) will be reported. The process evaluation will be
   undertaken to identify possible mechanisms for any observed effects. The
   data will inform full-scale evaluations of this co-produced, blended
   physiotherapy intervention.},

Title = {Feasibility and acceptability of an enhanced cognitive behavioural
   therapy programme for parent-child dyads with anxiety disorders: a
   mixed-methods pilot trial protocol},

Abstract = {Background: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most widely
   recognised and efficacious psychological therapy for the treatment of
   anxiety disorders in children and adults. However, suboptimal remission
   rates indicate room for improvement in treatments, particularly when
   both children and their parents have anxiety disorders. Bidirectional
   transmission and maintenance of anxiety within parent-child dyads could
   be better targeted by CBT, to improve treatment outcomes for children
   and parents with anxiety disorders. This study aimed to develop and
   evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a concurrent parent-child
   enhanced CBT intervention that targets the individual's anxiety
   disorder(s), as well as the bidirectional factors that influence and
   maintain anxiety in the dyad.
   Methods: Feasibility and acceptability of the proposed CBT protocol will
   be evaluated in an open-label pilot trial of the intervention utilising
   qualitative and quantitative data collection. Ten parent-child dyad
   participants (n = 20) with anxiety disorders will be recruited for the
   proposed intervention. The intervention is based on an empirically
   supported 10-week CBT programme for anxiety disorders in adults, adapted
   to be delivered to parent-child dyads concurrently, and to target
   anxious modelling and overprotective behaviours through joint
   observational exposures. Intervention feasibility will be explored by
   pre-post symptom change on a range of clinician- and self-report
   measures to determine preliminary indications of participants'
   intervention response and effect size calculations to estimate sample
   size for a future definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT).
   Additional feasibility measures will include recruitment rates,
   completion rates, and adherence to programme requirements. To explore
   participant acceptability of the intervention, qualitative interviews
   will be conducted with five parent-child dyads who complete the
   intervention (n = 10), along with five parent-child dyads with anxiety
   symptoms who express interest in the intervention (n = 10).
   Acceptability measures will include prospective and retrospective
   quantitative self-report and qualitative interview data.
   Discussion: This pilot trial will utilise a mixed-methods design to
   determine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering an enhanced
   CBT intervention for the concurrent treatment of parent-child dyads with
   anxiety disorders. The results of this trial will inform the development
   and implementation of a future definitive randomised clinical trial to
   evaluate intervention efficacy.},

   adolescent motherhood in Harare, Zimbabwe},

Abstract = {Background Adolescent mothers in Zimbabwe often experience stigma,
   isolation, and lack coping skills and resources to successfully navigate
   motherhood. Social isolation and stigma are linked to poor mental health
   outcomes. No interventions currently address mental health of adolescent
   mothers in Zimbabwe. Peer support groups in other contexts have been
   effective at increasing social connectedness, self-esteem, and
   self-efficacy, providing coping mechanisms to manage stigma experiences,
   in addition to empowering and improving mental health of adolescents and
   adolescent mothers. To develop a community-based peer support
   intervention, we aimed to understand the unique needs of adolescent
   mothers, how peer support groups could address those needs, and the
   feasibility of implementing the intervention. Methods Focus group
   discussions were conducted with 86 adolescent mothers aged 14-18 years,
   24 community health workers, and 25 key community stakeholders in a
   low-income high-density community in Harare. Data were analyzed
   thematically using NVivo 12 software. Results Participants described
   adolescent mother experiences with stigma and social isolation, in
   addition to challenges including gossip, lack of employment and
   educational opportunities, and gaps in services and programming. Peer
   support groups for adolescent mothers were welcomed to improve mental
   health, social support, knowledge sharing, and skills building.
   Participants identified varying preferred frequency and duration of
   group sessions addressing topics including income generation, mental
   health, and gossip, facilitated by community health workers at health
   and community centers. The use of WhatsApp Messenger to support
   intervention efforts was welcomed as an affordable and user-friendly
   platform to share information. Implementation (i.e., training,
   supervision, frequency, location, and co-facilitation) was feasible.
   Conclusions Adolescent mothers, community health workers and key
   community stakeholders welcomed the peer support groups as a feasible
   way to address the mothers' needs.},

Title = {Keeping adults physically active after Falls Management Exercise (FaME)
   programmes end: development of a physical activity maintenance
   intervention},

Abstract = {Background Falls prevention exercise programmes help to improve muscle
   strength, balance and physical function, and reduce falling rates in
   older adults. Improvements in muscle strength, balance and physical
   function are reversed if older adults do not continue to be physically
   active after falls prevention exercise programmes end. This paper
   describes the design process of an intervention that aimed to maintain
   physical activity in older adults exiting falls prevention exercise
   programmes. Methods The development of the Keeping Adults Physically
   Active (KAPA) intervention and its implementation plan was guided by
   Bartholomew's Intervention Mapping approach. The intervention mapping
   approach involved (1) performing a needs assessment and developing
   intervention objectives using previous literature; (2) identifying
   theory-based intervention strategies from a systematic review and the
   National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines; and (3) designing
   the KAPA intervention and its implementation plan with the guidance from
   an expert steering group. Results The KAPA intervention comprised of six
   group sessions of motivational interviewing, delivered monthly by
   trained and mentor-supported falls prevention practitioners.
   Intervention sessions lasted up to 90 min and were delivered in
   community settings over a 6-month duration. Participant manuals,
   illustrated exercise books, physical activity diaries and pedometers
   supported the KAPA intervention. Conclusions The intervention
   development process, consisting of Bartholomew's Intervention Mapping
   approach and the input from an expert steering group, was successful in
   creating the evidence-based KAPA intervention ready to be evaluated in a
   feasibility trial.},

Title = {Skills-based intervention to enhance collaborative decision-making:
   systematic adaptation and open trial protocol for veterans with

Abstract = {Background: Collaborative decision-making is an innovative
   decision-making approach that assigns equal power and responsibility to
   patients and providers. Most veterans with serious mental illnesses like
   schizophrenia want a greater role in treatment decisions, but there are
   no interventions targeted for this population. A skills-based
   intervention is promising because it is well-aligned with the recovery
   model, uses similar mechanisms as other evidence-based interventions in
   this population, and generalizes across decisional contexts while
   empowering veterans to decide when to initiate collaborative
   decision-making. Collaborative Decision Skills Training (CDST) was
   developed in a civilian serious mental illness sample and may fill this
   gap but needs to undergo a systematic adaptation process to ensure fit
   for veterans.
   Methods: In aim 1, the IM Adapt systematic process will be used to adapt
   CDST for veterans with serious mental illness. Veterans and Veteran's
   Affairs (VA) staff will join an Adaptation Resource Team and complete
   qualitative interviews to identify how elements of CDST or service
   delivery may need to be adapted to optimize its effectiveness or
   viability for veterans and the VA context. During aim 2, an open trial
   will be conducted with veterans in a VA Psychosocial Rehabilitation and
   Recovery Center (PRRC) to assess additional adaptations, feasibility,
   and initial evidence of effectiveness.
   Discussion: This study will be the first to evaluate a collaborative
   decision-making intervention among veterans with serious mental illness.
   It will also contribute to the field's understanding of perceptions of
   collaborative decision-making among veterans with serious mental illness
   and VA clinicians, and result in a service delivery manual that may be
   used to understand adaptation needs generally in VA PRRCs.},

Abstract = {Background: Stress can negatively impact an individual's health and
   well-being and high levels of stress are noted to exist among college
   students today. While traditional treatment methods are plagued with
   stigma and transfer problems, newly developed wearable biofeedback
   devices may offer unexplored possibilities. Although these products are
   becoming commonplace and inexpensive, scientific evidence of the
   effectiveness of these products is scarce and their feasibility within
   research contexts are relatively unexplored. Conversely, companies are
   not required, and possibly reluctant, to release information on the
   efficacy of these products against their claims. Thus, in the present
   pilot, we assess the feasibility of using a real-time respiratory-based
   biofeedback device in preparation for a larger study. Our main aims were
   to assess device-adherence and collaboration with the company that
   develops and sells the device.
   Method: Data were collected from 39 college students who self-identified
   as experiencing chronic stress at a Southwestern university in the USA.
   Students were randomized into either a mindfulness-only control group
   without a biofeedback device (n = 21), or an experimental group with
   biofeedback device (n = 18). Both groups received mindfulness meditation
   training. Pre-test and post-test procedures were conducted 2 weeks
   apart. Further, both participant compliance and company compliance were
   assessed and collaboration with the company was evaluated.
   Results: Participant device-adherence as well as the company's
   collaboration necessary for a full-scale study was determined to be low.
   This may also have affected our results which showed a strong main
   effect for time for all outcome variables, suggesting all groups showed
   improvement in their levels of stress after the intervention period. No
   group by time effects were identified, however, indicating no added
   benefit of the biofeedback device.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest feasibility of future studies requires
   full collaboration and detailed and agreed upon data sharing procedures
   with the biofeedback company. The particular device under investigation
   added no value to the intervention outcomes and it was not feasible to
   continue a larger-scale study. Further, as the technology sector is
   innovating faster than it can validate products, we urge for open
   science collaborations between public and private sectors to properly
   develop evidence-based regulations that can withstand technological
   innovation while maintaining product quality, safety, and effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Background Home exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) is highly prevalent
   amongst pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries like India
   and Bangladesh. The literature on the efficacy of behaviour change
   interventions to reduce home exposure to SHS in pregnancy is scarce.
   Methods We employed a theory and evidence-based approach to develop an
   intervention using pregnant women as agents of change for their
   husband's smoking behaviours at home. A systematic review of SHS
   behaviour change interventions led us to focus on developing a
   multicomponent intervention and informed selection of behaviour change
   techniques (BCTs) for review in a modified Delphi survey. The modified
   Delphi survey provided expert consensus on the most effective BCTs in
   reducing home exposure to SHS. Finally, a qualitative interview study
   provided context and detailed understanding of knowledge, attitudes and
   practices around SHS. This insight informed the content and delivery of
   the proposed intervention components. Results The final intervention
   consisted of four components: a report on saliva cotinine levels of the
   pregnant woman, a picture booklet containing information about SHS and
   its impact on health as well strategies to negotiate a smoke-free home,
   a letter from the future baby to their father encouraging him to provide
   a smoke-free home, and automated voice reminder and motivational
   messages delivered to husbands on their mobile phone. Intervention
   delivery was in a single face-to-face session with a research assistant
   who explained the cotinine report, discussed key strategies for ensuring
   a smoke-free environment at home and practised with pregnant women how
   they would share the booklet and letter with their husband and
   supportive family members. Conclusion A theory and evidence-based
   approach informed the development of a multicomponent behaviour change
   intervention, described here. The acceptability and feasibility of the
   intervention which was subsequently tested in a pilot RCT in India and
   Bangladesh will be published later.},

Title = {Implementation and preliminary testing of a theory-guided nursing
   discharge teaching intervention for adult inpatients aged 50 and over
   with multimorbidity: a pragmatic feasibility study protocol},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background: Discharge teaching by nurses during hospitalization is
   essential to provide multimorbid inpatients with the knowledge and
   skills to self-manage their health conditions. However, available
   disease-specific teaching guidelines do not address the cumulative
   complexity of multiple chronic diseases that occur with greater
   frequency in older adults. Therefore, there is a need for a discharge
   teaching intervention which uses concepts that specifically address the
   needs of these patients, such as considering their level of activation
   (i.e. knowledge, skills and confidence to self-manage their health) and
   the burden of multimorbid disease. The objectives of this pragmatic
   study will be to (1) test the feasibility of implementing a nursing
   discharge teaching intervention and (2) conduct a preliminary test of
   this novel discharge teaching intervention with adult inpatients age 50
   or greater who have multiple comorbid conditions.
   Methods: This study uses a two-group pre-posttest design. Participants
   are drawn from medical units in three hospitals in the French-speaking
   part of Switzerland. The implementation of the intervention will be
   facilitated by implementation strategies from the Theoretical Domains
   Framework and the Behavior Change Wheel and will target change in
   nurses' teaching behaviours. Implementation outcomes will include
   measures of feasibility of the implementation strategies and the
   intervention process. Participants in the intervention group will
   receive tailored discharge teaching by trained teaching nurses. Patient
   outcomes will inform the preliminary testing of the intervention and
   will be measured with validated questionnaires assessing patients'
   activation level, health confidence, perceived readiness for discharge,
   experience with the discharge process and rate of and time to
   readmission.
   Discussion: The study takes a pragmatic approach to examining the
   feasibility of implementing the discharge teaching intervention to
   contribute to the knowledge development within the context of the
   real-world practice setting. Results will provide the foundation for
   clinical trials to build evidence for widespread adoption of this
   intervention.},

Title = {Addressing the mental health needs of adolescents in South African
   communities: a protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial},

Abstract = {Background: Like many low- and middle-income countries, almost half of
   the proportion of the South African population is under the age of 25.
   Given the peak age of onset for most mental health problems is in
   adolescence, it is vital that adolescents have access to mental health
   counselling. There are several initiatives to increase access to mental
   health counselling in South Africa, primarily through the integration of
   counselling for common mental disorders (CMD) into primary health care
   services, but adolescents (15-18 years of age) generally do not utilize
   these services. To address this gap, we will undertake a study to
   explore the feasibility of conducting a trial of the effectiveness of a
   community-based mental health counselling intervention for adolescents
   at-risk for a CMD.
   Methods: The study is a feasibility trial of the ASPIRE intervention, a
   four-session blended multi-component counselling intervention adapted
   for South African adolescents at risk for depression and alcohol use
   disorders. We will enrol 100 adolescents from community settings and
   randomly assign them to the ASPIRE intervention or a comparison
   condition. Feasibility measures, such as rates of recruitment, consent
   to participate in the trial and retention, will be calculated.
   Qualitative interviews with participants and counsellors will explore
   the acceptability of the intervention. The primary outcomes for a
   subsequent trial would be reductions in symptoms of depression and days
   of heavy drinking which will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3
   months post-randomization.
   Discussion: This feasibility trial using a mixed-methods design will
   allow us to determine whether we can move forward to a larger
   effectiveness trial of the ASPIRE intervention.},

Abstract = {Background: Very premature birth (gestational age between 28 and 31 + 6
   weeks) is associated with increased risk of cognitive delay and
   attention deficit disorder, which have been linked to anomalies in the
   development of executive functions (EFs) and their precursors. In
   particular, very preterm (VP) infants display anomalies in controlling
   attention and gathering task-relevant information. Early interventions
   that support attention control may be pivotal in providing a secure base
   for VP children's later attainments. The Attention Control Training
   (ACT) is a cognitive training intervention that targets infants'
   abilities to select visual information according to varying task demands
   but had not been tested in VP infants. We conducted a feasibility study
   to test the processes we intend to use in a trial delivering the ACT to
   VP infants.
   Methods and design: We tested recruitment and retention of VP infants
   and their families in a randomised trial, as well as acceptability and
   completion of baseline and outcome measures. To evaluate these aims, we
   used descriptive quantitative statistics and qualitative methods to
   analyse feedback from infants' caregivers. We also investigated the
   quality of eye-tracking data collected and indicators of infants'
   engagement in the training, using descriptive statistics.
   Results: Twelve VP infants were recruited, and 10 (83\%) completed the
   study. Participants' parents had high education attainment. The rate of
   completion of baseline and outcome measures was optimal. VP infants
   demonstrated engagement in the training, completing on average 84 min of
   training over three visits, and displaying improved performance during
   this training. Eye-tracking data quality was moderate, but this did not
   interfere with infants' engagement in the training.
   Discussion: The results suggest the ACT can be delivered to VP infants.
   However, challenges remain in recruitment of numerous and diverse
   samples. We discuss strategies to overcome these challenges informed by
   results of this study.},

Abstract = {Background Hospitalization can be a source of great stress for children
   and their families. In high-income countries, there are specialized
   staff to help children cope using different techniques including play.
   However, it is a major challenge in low and middle-income countries
   (LMIC) due to financial constraints and untrained human resource. The
   objective of study was to develop and test the feasibility and
   acceptance of a psychology trainee-delivered model postulated on
   employing play as a means of enhancing child-parent interactions leading
   to reduced stress during hospitalization. Methods This study was
   conducted in the paediatric ward of a tertiary care private hospital in
   Pakistan. Pre-intervention survey revealed that parental stress stemmed
   mainly from seeing their child irritable, distressed, or in pain. Using
   a theory of change model, a play-based psychosocial intervention was
   developed to address these factors. The intervention approach was
   informed by principles of Nurturing Care Framework and play therapy.
   Children between birth and 6 years admitted in the acute care ward were
   eligible. The intervention was delivered between March 2019 and December
   2020 by psychology trainees who were supervised by a clinical
   psychologist. The play-based sessions were delivered at the bedside and
   ranged from 20 to 40 min. Parents receiving the intervention were later
   interviewed for their stress, child emotions, and feedback about the
   service using structured surveys administered by psychology graduates.
   The trainees delivering the intervention were requested to provide their
   feedback as a written qualitative open-ended narrative. These narratives
   were analyzed using an inductive approach. Results The survey was
   conducted with 223 families with about half of the sample having
   children under 2 years of age. Forty-five percent of parents reported
   play intervention to be one of 3 key factors in improving their
   experience during hospital stay. Only 5\% of parents reported feeling
   stressed about the child illness after the intervention. Ninety to 96\%
   parents felt respected, listened to, and understood by the therapists.
   Thematic analysis of the feedback by trainees indicated the internship
   to be a useful experience and a new avenue for professional life whereas
   physicians appreciated the interventions. Conclusions The authors
   conclude that psychology trainees can feasibly deliver a play-based
   intervention under supervision for reduced stress in children and their
   parents during hospitalization with mutual benefits.},

Title = {Feasibility of ABLE 1.0-a program aiming at enhancing the ability to
   perform activities of daily living in persons with chronic conditions},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background: The ``A Better everyday LifE{''} (ABLE) intervention was
   developed to accommodate the need of a program addressing ability to
   perform activities of daily living (ADL) in persons with chronic
   conditions living at home. During intervention development, it is
   necessary to evaluate relevant aspects of the feasibility of a program.
   Thus, the aim was to evaluate the feasibility of content and delivery of
   ABLE version 1.0.
   Methods: A one group pre- and post-test design was applied. Thirty
   persons with chronic conditions, two occupational therapists (OTs), and
   five occupational therapy students (OTSs) participated. ABLE 1.0 is an
   8-week program consisting of ADL evaluation (session 1); goal setting
   and reasons for ADL problems (session 2); intervention (sessions 3-7);
   and re-evaluation (final session), conducted in the clients'
   home-setting and local area. Sessions 1-4 and the final session was
   mandatory. To evaluate the feasibility of content and delivery, the OTs,
   after each session, reported on applied intervention component(s),
   time-use, needed equipment, adjustments, meaningfulness, confidence,
   progress toward goal attainment, and side effects using registration
   forms. The clients reported on progress toward goal attainment,
   meaningfulness, and satisfaction. Clinically relevant improvements in
   ADL ability were identified using the ADL-Interview (ADL-I) and the
   Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS). Goal attainment was
   evaluated using the Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS).
   Results: Twenty clients (67\%) completed ABLE 1.0 and received four
   sessions (median = 4, range 4-7) each lasting between 30 and 94 min.
   Most frequently applied component was ``Changing habits related to task
   performance{''}. Generally, OTs reported having the needed equipment.
   Deviations from the manual were made by omission of GAS and AMPS and
   less than mandatory number of sessions per client. The OTs reported
   confidence in delivering the program and the clients perceived the
   program as meaningful and satisfying, and experienced progress toward
   goal attainment. Goal attainment was found in 52\% of the goals. Sixteen
   (80\%) clients obtained clinically relevant improvements in
   self-reported or observed ADL ability.
   Conclusions: The content and delivery of ABLE 1.0 was feasible. However,
   the study revealed a need to adjust the recruitment procedure and make
   minor changes in the intervention manual. A pilot randomized controlled
   trial (RCT) study is recommended.},

Title = {Development of a behaviour change workplace-based intervention to
   improve nurses' eating and physical activity},

Abstract = {Background There is a critical need for an intervention to improve
   nurses' eating and physical activity behaviours. As nurses spend a
   substantial proportion of their waking hours at work, concerted efforts
   to deliver such interventions in the workplace is growing. This study
   formed part of a multiphase programme of research that aimed to
   systematically develop an evidence-based and theory-informed workplace
   intervention to promote changes in eating and physical activity among
   nurses. Methods The intervention was developed iteratively, in line with
   Medical Research Council complex intervention guidelines. It involved
   four activities: (1) identifying the evidence base, (2) understanding
   the determinants of nurses' eating and physical activity behaviour
   change through theory-based qualitative interviews and survey, (3)
   identifying intervention options using the Behaviour Change Wheel, and
   (4) specifying intervention content and implementation options using a
   taxonomy of behaviour change techniques. Results Data from 13 randomised
   controlled trials indicated that workplace-based behaviour change
   interventions targeted to this population are effective in changing
   behaviour. The evidence base was, however, limited in quantity and
   quality. Nurses' beliefs about important factors determining their
   eating and physical activity behaviour were identified across 16
   qualitative interviews and 245 survey responses, and key determinants
   included environmental context and resources, behavioural regulation,
   emotion, beliefs about consequences, knowledge and optimism. Based on
   these findings, 22 behaviour change techniques suitable for targeting
   the identified determinants were identified and combined into a
   potential workplace intervention. Conclusions An evidence-based and
   theory-informed intervention tailored to the target population and
   setting has been explicitly conceptualised using a systematic approach.
   The proposed intervention addresses previous evidence gaps for the user
   population of nurses. Further to this, such an intervention, if
   implemented, has the potential to impact nurses' eating and physical
   activity behaviours and in turn, the health of nurses and the quality of
   healthcare delivery.},

Title = {A classroom intervention targeting working memory, attention and
   language skills: a cluster randomised feasibility trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background: International debate around the best models of speech and
   language therapy provision for children with language disorders has
   highlighted the need for research into classroom-based approaches and
   intervention dosage. Working memory (WM) is a cognitive skill linked to
   attention and language. `Recall to Enhance Children's Attention,
   Language and Learning' (RECALL) is a novel, 6-week, classroom-based
   intervention delivered by health professionals (HPs) and teachers. It is
   designed to target WM and enhance attention and language skills in 4-5
   year olds.
   Methods: A cluster randomised feasibility trial was conducted to
   investigate aspects of the feasibility of a definitive trial to evaluate
   RECALL: (i) recruitment and sampling procedures; (ii) compliance and
   fidelity; (iii) the acceptability of RECALL to HPs and teachers; (iv)
   the appropriateness of the outcome measures. Six classes of 4-5 year
   olds participated: two received RECALL, two received an existing
   intervention targeting attention skills (not underpinned by WM theory),
   and two received education as usual (no intervention). Ten children in
   each class (n = 60) were sampled to assess the appropriateness of the
   outcome measures. Classroom observations were conducted to measure
   fidelity and semi-structured interviews with HPs, and teachers explored
   the acceptability of RECALL.
   Results: The recruitment targets were met, and all six schools completed
   the trial, but the sampling procedures require modification. Compliance
   was good (95\% of RECALL sessions were delivered), but fidelity to the
   intervention protocol varied between 76\% and 45\% across the two
   schools. This was influenced by large class sizes, child factors, and
   facilitator factors, e.g., their understanding of the theory
   underpinning the intervention. The lack of fidelity reduced the dose
   (number of practice items) accessed by individual children, particularly
   those most at risk. There were mixed findings regarding the
   acceptability of RECALL and the appropriateness of the outcome measures.
   Conclusions: The trial protocol could be easily scaled-up in a future
   definitive trial, with an amended sampling procedure. RECALL should be
   repackaged as a small group intervention to enhance the fidelity of its
   delivery and its acceptability to HPs and teachers. This study
   highlights the need for thorough training for professionals who deliver
   classroom-based interventions for children with language disorders.},

Abstract = {Introduction: An active play is designed to increase children's physical
   activity levels and fundamental movement skills through outdoor play and
   is well-suited to the needs of children with intellectual disabilities.
   However, no active play interventions have included children with
   intellectual disabilities. This study aims to investigate the
   feasibility of a school-based active play intervention for children with
   intellectual disabilities.
   Method: Children aged 7-12 years who had intellectual disabilities and
   were independently ambulatory were eligible. This single-group 17-week
   intervention was implemented in two additional support needs schools. It
   consisted of a weekly 1-h active play session incorporating 30 min of
   structured games and 30 min of free play. Feasibility of
   recruitment/retention, adherence, and outcome measures were
   investigated. Outcome measures included school-based physical activity
   (ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer), fundamental movement skills (Test of
   Gross Motor Development-2), and social interactions (Playground
   Observation of Peer Engagement). Staff feedback was collected via
   open-ended questionnaire. Feasibility was investigated using descriptive
   statistics and questionnaire data analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Potential pre-post changes were investigated for school-based physical
   activity, fundamental movement skills, and social interactions using
   paired samples t tests. The progression criteria were (1) > 50\% of
   eligible participants recruited, (2) > 50\% of recruited participants
   retained, (3) > 50\% of active play sessions spent in MVPA, and (4) >
   50\% of participants complete outcome measurements.
   Results: All progression criteria were met. Recruitment and retention
   rates were 100\% (n=21 participants). Intervention adherence was high,
   based on data from n=1 school, with 90\% of participants attending all
   sessions. Measuring physical activity using accelerometry and
   fundamental movement skills using the Test of Gross Motor Development-2
   were feasible. The Playground Observation of Peer Engagement tool to
   measure social interactions was not feasible. The only significant
   increase post-intervention was for social interactions during structured
   play (pre-post mean difference: -1.46, 95\% CI -1.99, -0.93). Staff
   feedback was positive with the intervention well received by schools and
   potential benefits post-intervention identified by teachers.
   Conclusion: The Go2Play Active Play intervention is feasible for
   children with intellectual disabilities. Future research should further
   investigate feasibility and implementation on a larger scale using a
   pilot cluster randomised controlled trial.},

Title = {Adherence to self-managed exercises for patients with persistent
   subacromial pain: the Ad-Shoulder feasibility study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background: Exercise is recommended for patients with subacromial pain.
   It has been suggested that good exercise adherence improves clinical
   outcomes. Despite this, little attention has been paid to the need for
   behavioural frameworks to enhance adherence to home exercise programmes
   for patients with subacromial pain.
   Methods: A feasibility study with pre-post design was used. Participants
   aged > 18 years, with subacromial pain, who had received conservative
   treatment during the past 6 months, were recruited. The Ad-Shoulder
   intervention consisted of 1-5 individual sessions provided over 3 months
   and was based on 5 self-management skills, which aimed to enhance the
   patients' self-efficacy and adherence to self-managed exercises. The
   primary objectives were assessed according to predefined progression
   criteria: (1) the recruitment rate (10 patients enrolled within 12
   weeks), (2) follow-up rate (>= 80\% on all self-reported measures), (3)
   objective physical activity measures (>= 80\% of participants would
   contribute valid data at each time point), (4) adherence with the
   self-managed exercises (>= 80\% of the participants would adhere to >=
   80\% of the assigned home exercise programme), (5) fidelity of the
   delivery of the intervention (the therapists delivered the intervention
   according to the protocol) and (6) adverse events (< 30\% would report
   adverse events (including mild)). The results were reported using
   descriptive statistics.
   Results: Eleven patients were recruited during 16 weeks. Ten patients
   completed the self-reported measures at baseline and week 12. Objective
   physical activity measures were successfully obtained for 100\% (11/11)
   at baseline, 64\% (7/11) at week six and 82\% at week 12. Fifty-five
   percent (6/11) of the participants satisfactorily completed at least
   80\% of their home exercise programme. All sessions were delivered
   according to the protocol. None of the patients reported any adverse
   events.
   Conclusions: Objective physical activity data measures at baseline and
   week 12, follow-up, the physiotherapists' fidelity to the intervention
   and adverse events met our pre-specified progression criteria.
   Recruitment and adherence to the self-managed exercise programme were
   both below the anticipated level. Further intervention development is
   necessary to understand whether adherence to the self-managed exercises
   could be enhanced and additional methods of recruitment would need to be
   considered, including additional recruitment sites, in any planning for
   a future main trial.},

Title = {Pilot Randomised Evaluation of Singing in Dementia (PRESIDE): protocol

Abstract = {Background: As the number of people living with dementia grows, so does
   the need to provide them with adequate psychosocial support. Many people
   with dementia live at home with family carers, who also require social
   and emotional support to cope with their role. Community group singing
   has received attention for its potential to support people with dementia
   and their carers. It is postulated that singing can improve cognitive
   function, strengthen the bonds between care partners and help to
   establish social support networks. However, there is a lack of rigorous
   evidence of singing's benefits for this population. This study aims to
   test the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial of community
   singing in dementia, to pave the way for a larger, conclusive study.
   Methods: The PRESIDE study is designed as a two-arm, parallel-group
   randomised trial with a waiting list control. Dyads consisting of a
   person with dementia (n = 80) and their carer (n = 80) will be
   recruited. Each dyad will be randomised either to attend 10 weeks of
   community group singing sessions straight away or to wait for 3 months
   before attending the sessions. The singing sessions will be led by
   experienced professional musicians and will last about 90 min, including
   time for socialising. The primary outcome of this study is the
   attainment of feasibility criteria around recruitment, retention and the
   acceptability of the waiting list control. Secondary outcomes include
   the quality of life, mood, cognition, and musical engagement of the
   person with dementia, and quality of life, mood, and
   experiences/challenges of the carer. These data will be collected during
   home visits at baseline, and 3 and 6 months post-baseline.
   Discussion: Despite growing public interest in the positive effects of
   singing, and encouraging findings from qualitative and non-randomised
   quantitative studies, there is a lack of rigorous evidence. This is the
   first randomised controlled trial of community group singing for people
   with dementia in Europe, to our knowledge. If the results favour a full
   trial, conclusively demonstrating the effectiveness of group singing
   could positively affect the opportunities available to
   community-dwelling people with dementia and their carers.},

Abstract = {Background: Home visiting is a well-supported strategy for addressing
   maternal and child health disparities. However, evidence-based models
   generally share implementation challenges at scale, including engagement
   and retention of families. Precision home visiting may address this
   issue. This paper describes the first known pilot randomized
   implementation trial of a precision home visiting approach vs. standard
   implementation. Primary aims are to: 1) explore the acceptability and
   feasibility of a precision approach to home visiting and 2) examine the
   difference between Standard Family Spirit and Precision Family Spirit on
   participants' program satisfaction, client-home visitor relationship,
   goal alliance, and the impact of these factors on participant engagement
   and retention. Secondary aims are to explore potential differences on
   maternal behavioral and mental health outcomes and child development
   outcomes to inform sample size estimations for a fully powered study.
   Methods: This is a pilot Hybrid Type 3 implementation trial. Four
   Michigan communities primarily serving the Native American families and
   already using Family Spirit were randomized by site to receive Standard
   Family Spirit or Precision Family Spirit. Participants include N = 60
   mothers at least 14 years of age (pregnant or with a newborn < 2 months
   of age) currently enrolled in Family Spirit. Precision Family Spirit
   participants receive core lessons plus additional lessons based on needs
   identified at baseline and that emerge during the trial. Control mothers
   receive the standard sequence of Family Spirit lessons. Data is
   collected at baseline (< 2 months postpartum), and 2, 6, and 12 months
   postpartum. All Precision Family Spirit participants are invited to
   complete qualitative interviews at study midpoint and endpoint. All home
   visitors are invited to participate in focus groups between study
   midpoint and endpoint. Exploratory data analysis will assess
   feasibility, acceptability, client-home visitor relationship, retention,
   adherence, and potential differences in intervention outcomes.
   Discussion: This trial will provide new information about the
   acceptability and feasibility of precision home visiting and pilot data
   on program satisfaction, client-home visitor relationship, goal
   alliance, retention, and targeted maternal-child intervention outcomes.
   Findings will inform the design of a fully powered randomized
   implementation trial of precision vs. standard home visiting.},

Abstract = {Background: This article reports the results from a feasibility study of
   an intervention ('E-PLAYS') aimed at supporting children who experience
   difficulties with social communication. E-PLAYS is based around a dyadic
   computer game, which aims to develop collaborative and communication
   skills. A pilot study found that when E-PLAYS was delivered by
   researchers, improvements on communication test scores and on
   collaborative behaviours were observed. The aim of this study was to
   ascertain the feasibility of running a full-scale trial to test the
   effectiveness of E-PLAYS in a National Health Service (NHS) setting with
   delivery by speech and language therapists and teaching assistants.
   Methods: The study was a two-arm feasibility cluster-randomised
   controlled trial of the E-PLAYS intervention with a treatment as usual
   control arm. Data relating to recruitment and retention, treatment
   fidelity, acceptability to participants, suitability of outcomes and
   feasibility of collecting health economic measures and of determining
   cost-effectiveness were collected. Speech and language therapists
   selected suitable children (ages 4-7 years old) from their caseload.
   E-PLAYS intervention (experimental group) was then delivered by teaching
   assistants overseen by speech and language therapists. The control group
   received usual care. Assessments included blinded language measures and
   observations, non-blinded teacher-reported measures of peer relations
   and classroom behaviour and non-blinded parent-reported use of health
   and education resources and quality of life.
   Results: Planned recruitment was for 70 children, in the event, 50
   children were recruited which was sufficient for feasibility purposes.
   E-PLAYS was very highly rated by children, teaching assistants and
   speech and language therapists and treatment fidelity did not pose any
   issues. We were able to collect health economic data which suggests that
   E-PLAYS would be a low-cost intervention.
   Conclusion: Based on recruitment, retention and adherence rates and our
   outcome measures, a full-scale randomised controlled trial estimated
   appears feasible and warranted to assess the effectiveness of E-PLAYS
   for use by the NHS and schools.},

Abstract = {BackgroundDepression is a common health problem during adolescence and
   is associated with adverse academic, social and health outcomes. To meet
   the demand for treatment for adolescent depression, there is a need for
   evidence-based interventions suitable for delivery outside of specialist
   Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Interpersonal
   Counselling for Adolescents (IPC-A) is a brief manualised intervention
   for adolescent depression suitable for delivery by staff who are not
   qualified health professionals following participation in a brief
   training course. While initial piloting within Local Authority services
   has generated promising results, the effectiveness and
   cost-effectiveness of IPC-A has yet to be established. This study aims
   to assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT),
   evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IPC-A delivered
   by staff without core professional training in comparison to current
   provision.MethodFeasibility RCT with process evaluation using
   ethnographic methodology. Eligible young people (n = 60) will be
   randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either IPC-A or treatment as usual
   (TAU). Participants will be assessed pre-randomisation (baseline) and
   followed up at 5, 10 and 23weeks post-randomisation. A parallel process
   evaluation will generate understanding of intervention implementation
   across services and explore the acceptability of the intervention from
   the perspective of young people and other key
   stakeholders.ParticipantsYoung people aged 12-18years presenting to
   non-specialist services with symptoms of depression. Youth workers,
   young people and stakeholders will participate in the process
   evaluation.DiscussionThe need for effective and accessible interventions
   for young people with mild/sub-threshold depression who, in most cases,
   do not meet the threshold for mainstream mental health services is long
   overdue. The primary output of this feasibility trial will be the design
   of the subsequent full-scale trial. If the results of the current study
   indicate that this would be feasible, we intend to progress to a
   multi-site, assessor-blind, superiority RCT of the effectiveness and
   cost-effectiveness of IPC-A in comparison to TAU for adolescents
   presenting to non-specialist services with depressive symptoms. If
   satisfactory solutions to any problems encountered cannot be identified,
   alternative research designs will be considered. If proven effective, an
   IPC-A training programme could be implemented.Trial registryISRCTN

Abstract = {BackgroundChildren with Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SPCD)
   have long-term needs in using and processing social language and have a
   high risk of later mental health difficulties. A manualised speech and
   language therapy programme, the Social Communication Intervention
   Programme (SCIP) provides therapy content for SPCD. A feasibility study
   is required to derive more precise estimates of key parameters for a
   future trial of SCIP.AimsTo assess the feasibility of conducting a
   substantive randomized controlled trial of SCIP for children with
   SPCD.MethodsA questionnaire was distributed to paediatric speech and
   language therapists in England. Survey questions addressed number of
   eligible children, routine intervention provision and trial recruitment
   factors. In the second phase, a single-arm intervention feasibility
   study was completed. Fifteen speech and language practitioners
   identified 24 children aged 5-11years with SPCD. Practitioners received
   training/supervision to deliver 20 SCIP therapy sessions to each child.
   At time 1, parents of participating children provided three
   communication goals; expected steps in each goal were defined. After
   intervention, parents and practitioners independently rated each goal
   compared to baseline ability. Two research practitioners compared parent
   post-intervention commentaries with outcome scores to derive guidance
   about clinical significance. All practitioners recorded audio
   commentaries on therapy experiences. Post-intervention interviews were
   conducted with 6 practitioners and 6 parents. An expert panel completed
   a Delphi consultation on trial design.ResultsRoutine practice for SPCD
   varies widely. Children tend to be embedded in autism provision.
   Participation in a future trial was well supported provided resources
   are available to services. Outcomes analysis indicated all children
   except one made some progress on parent ratings; all children made
   progress on practitioner ratings. A power analysis for a future trial
   was carried out using current outcome measure as putative primary
   endpoint. Practitioners' audio-diaries provided suggestions for training
   and adaption in a future trial. Outcomes and therapy methods were
   acceptable to practitioners and parents.ConclusionsThe feasibility study
   evaluated a novel outcome measure of social communication skills in
   SPCD. A power calculation indicated a feasible framework for a trial
   within a realistic period of time. Recommendations for recruitment
   methods, adaptation of manual and training were supported by
   practitioners and an expert panel.Trial registrationTitle:

Title = {Designing integrated interventions to improve nutrition and WASH
   behaviors in Kenya},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {BackgroundChild stunting, an indicator of chronic malnutrition, is a
   global public health problem. Malnutrition during pregnancy and the
   first 2 years of life undermines the survival, growth, and development
   of children. Exposure to fecal pathogens vis-a-vis inadequate water,
   sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) has been implicated in the etiology of
   child stunting, highlighting the need to integrate WASH with
   nutrition-sensitive interventions to comprehensively address this
   complex problem. The aim of this study was to describe a systematic,
   theoretically informed approach (that drew from the Starr and Fornoff
   approach to the Theory of Change development and the Behavior Change
   Wheel approach) to design a multi-component and integrated social and
   behavior change intervention to improve WASH and nutrition-related
   behaviors in western Kenya.MethodsThis intervention was developed to be
   integrated into an existing project that utilized the care group model
   and aimed to create a culture of care and support for HIV/AIDS-affected
   children under two and their caregivers and was executed by local
   partners. We tested the newly created intervention packages in
   user-testing trials using an adapted Trials of Improved Practices
   approach to pilot acceptability and feasibility.ResultsUsing authentic
   stakeholder engagement and relevant theories, we conducted an 8-step
   process: (1) conduct mixed methods formative research, (2) prioritize
   target behaviors, (3) use causal analysis to create problem trees, (4)
   develop solution trees and articulate assumptions and rationales for
   change, (5) link solution trees to intervention functions, (6) develop
   the intervention plan, (7) create the intervention packages, and (8)
   test and refine the intervention packages.ConclusionsThis study
   highlights the need to take a multi-sectorial, integrated approach that
   integrates contextually relevant behavior change theories with the
   experiential knowledge gleaned from stakeholders into the design of
   interventions that seek to reduce child stunting. This process resulted
   in the creation of intervention packages that grouped behaviors
   thematically to be most relevant and responsive to the population
   context. This work has the potential to make important contributions
   towards achievement of the United Nations' sustainable development
   goals.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that 11\%
   of children (ages 5 to 17) worldwide are child laborers. ILO recently
   drew attention to migrant child laborers as an underreported, but more
   vulnerable group to adverse outcomes relative to children working
   locally. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) continues to be the continent with the
   highest rates of child labor, with Ghana registering one of the highest
   incidence rates at 22\%, including unaccompanied child migrants engaged
   in labor. Adolescent girls make up the majority of unaccompanied
   rural-to-urban migrants in search of better economic opportunities.
   Studies document the myriad of serious threats to health and emotional
   well-being experienced by adolescent girls who migrate to engage in
   child labor. These threats underline the urgent need for theoretically
   informed preventive interventions, specifically tailored to address the
   root causes of female child migrant labor and the needs of girls from
   economically insecure families and communities.MethodsA two-arm cluster
   randomized control trial will be conducted to assess the feasibility,
   acceptability, and preliminary impact of ANZANSI (family economic
   empowerment + multiple family groups) among 100 adolescent girls and
   their caregivers in the Northern Region of Ghana. Ten schools will be
   randomly selected from a list of eligible schools, and randomized to one
   of two study arms: (1) control arm (n = 5 schools, n = 50
   adolescent-caregiver dyads); (2) treatment arm (n = 5 schools, n = 50
   adolescent-caregiver dyads) receiving ANZANSI over a 9-month period.
   Adolescents (ages 11 to 14) in the same school will be assigned to the
   same study condition to avoid contamination.DiscussionThe primary aim of
   the study is to address the urgent need for theoretically and
   empirically informed interventions that prevent adolescent girls'
   unaccompanied rural-to-urban migration for child labor. Existing
   programs are not preventive and primarily target children who already
   migrated to the city and are living and working on the streets. This
   study is one of the first studies to pilot test a combination
   intervention, integrating family economic empowerment targeting
   household poverty with multiple family groups addressing family cohesion
   and perceptions on gender norms, child education/labor, all of which are
   factors, when combined, force girls to drop out of school and
   migrate.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov; NCT04231669; Registered

Abstract = {BackgroundAs dietary behaviours developed during early childhood are
   known to track into adulthood, interventions that aim to improve child
   nutrition at a population level are recommended. Whilst early childhood
   education and care (ECEC) is a promising setting for interventions
   targeting children's nutrition behaviours, previous interventions have
   largely used high intensity, face-to-face approaches, limiting their
   reach, implementation and potential impact at a population level.
   Web-based modalities represent a promising means of supporting the
   delivery of childcare-based interventions whilst overcoming challenges
   of previous approaches; however, the feasibility of using such
   modalities to support implementation is largely unknown. As such, this
   study sought to collect feasibility and pilot data to inform the design
   of a web-based intervention together with health promotion officer
   support within childcare centres. Child dietary intake will also be
   assessed to provide an estimate of the impact of the implementation
   intervention.MethodsA superiority cluster randomised controlled trial
   with repeat cross-sectional data collection employing an
   effectiveness-implementation type-II hybrid design will be conducted
   with childcare centres within the Hunter New England region of New South
   Wales, Australia. Type-II hybrid designs provide the opportunity to
   assess intervention efficacy whilst piloting the feasibility of the
   implementation strategies. Centres allocated to the intervention group
   will receive access to a web-based program together with health
   promotion officer support to implement targeted healthy eating practices
   to improve child diet in care. A number of outcomes will be assessed to
   inform the feasibility to conduct a larger trial, including childcare
   centre and parent recruitment and consent rates for each component of
   data collection, uptake of the implementation strategies, acceptability
   of the intervention and implementation strategies, appropriateness of
   the implementation strategies and the contextual factors influencing
   implementation.DiscussionThis study will provide high-quality evidence
   regarding the potential feasibility of a web-based intervention and the
   impact of healthy eating practices on child diet in care. Web-based
   modalities provide a promising approach for population-wide
   implementation support to childcare centres given their potential reach
   and consistency with existing infrastructure.Trial

Abstract = {BackgroundMindfulness-based programs are a novel and promising approach
   for supporting teachers' occupational health and well-being. Although
   rationales for mindfulness programs for teachers have been offered, the
   empirical research base evaluating approaches for educating teachers in
   mindfulness is still developing. This study reports the findings of a
   pilot study of a mindfulness-based program. This study is unique in that
   it is one of the only studies of the Mindfulness-Based Emotional Balance
   (MBEB) program to focus on early elementary teachers, to be implemented
   by a new instructor, and to recruit teachers via extrinsic
   motivators.MethodsA pre-post, uncontrolled pilot study of a 27.5-h
   mindfulness-based program for teachers was conducted with 21
   pre-kindergarten-third-grade teachers from the Pacific Northwest of the
   USA. Program acceptability was assessed based on attendance and teacher
   reports of program benefits. Effect sizes for within-person changes
   (from pre- to post-program) in teachers' skills and mindsets,
   well-being, occupational health, and teaching practices were calculated.
   Teachers also suggested improvements to the program.ResultsWith regard
   to program attendance and acceptability, teachers attended 87\% of
   sessions, with 58\% of teachers reporting a personal benefit and 58\% of
   teachers reporting a professional benefit of the program. Effect sizes
   for changes in teachers' skills and mindsets ranged from small to large,
   |d| = 0.30 to 0.83, and ranged from small to medium for changes in
   teachers' well-being |d| = 0.07 to 0.48, occupational health |d| = 0.14
   to 0.39, and teaching practices |d| = 0.15 to 0.48. Teachers suggested
   shortening the program and linking it more closely to their work in the
   classroom.ConclusionsThis study suggests that the MBEB program may be
   beneficial to early elementary teachers, even when implemented by
   someone other than the program developer, and when provided with
   extrinsic motivation to participate (more closely mapping to a
   larger-scale trial of the program). Teachers' suggestions regarding
   program length and structure are considered, along with useful avenues
   for future research on mindfulness-based programs for teachers.},

Title = {The feasibility of a Comprehensive Resilience-building psychosocial
   Intervention (CREST) for people with dementia in the community: protocol
   for a non-randomised feasibility study},

Abstract = {BackgroundA dementia diagnosis can prevent people from participating in
   society, leading to a further decline in cognitive, social and physical
   health. However, it may be possible for people with dementia to continue
   to live meaningful lives and continue to participate actively in society
   if a supportive psychosocial environment exists. Resilience theory,
   which focuses on strengthening personal attributes and external assets
   in the face of serious challenges, may provide a scaffold on which an
   inclusive multifaceted psychosocial supportive environment can be built.
   This protocol paper describes a study to determine the feasibility of
   conducting a multifaceted complex resilience building psychosocial
   intervention for people with dementia and their caregivers living in the
   community.MethodsThis is a non-randomised feasibility study. Ten
   participants with dementia and their primary caregivers living in the
   community will be recruited and receive the CREST intervention. The
   intervention provides (a) a 7-week cognitive stimulation programme
   followed by an 8-week physical exercise programme for people with
   dementia and (b) a 6-week educational programme for caregivers. Members
   of the wider community will be invited to a dementia awareness programme
   and GP practices to a dementia training workshop. Trained professionals
   will deliver all intervention components. Outcomes will assess the
   feasibility and acceptability of all study processes. The feasibility
   and acceptability of a range of outcomes to be collected in a future
   definitive trial, including economic measurements, will also be
   explored. Finally, social marketing will be used to map a route toward
   stigma change in dementia for use in a subsequent trial. Quantitative
   feasibility outcome assessments will be completed at baseline and after
   completion of the 15-week intervention while qualitative data will be
   collected at recruitment, baseline, during and post-intervention
   delivery.ConclusionThis feasibility study will provide evidence
   regarding the feasibility and acceptability of a comprehensive
   multifaceted psychosocial intervention programme for people with
   dementia and their caregivers (CREST). The results will be used to
   inform the development and implementation of a subsequent RCT, should
   the findings support feasibility.Trial registrationISRCTN25294519

Abstract = {BackgroundChildren with intellectual disability have an IQ < 70,
   associated deficits in adaptive skills and are at increased risk of
   having clinically concerning levels of behaviour problems. In addition,
   parents of children with intellectual disability are likely to report
   high levels of mental health and other psychological problems. The Early
   Positive Approaches to Support (E-PAtS) programme for family caregivers
   of young children (5years and under) with intellectual and developmental
   disabilities is a group-based intervention which aims to enhance
   parental psychosocial wellbeing and service access and support positive
   development for children. The aim of this study is to assess the
   feasibility of delivering E-PAtS to family caregivers of children with
   intellectual disability by community parenting support service provider
   organisations. The study will inform a potential, definitive RCT of the
   effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of E-PAtS.MethodsThis study is a
   feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial, with embedded process
   evaluation. Up to 2 family caregivers will be recruited from 64 families
   with a child (18months to 5years) with intellectual disability at
   research sites in the UK. Participating families will be allocated to
   intervention: control on a 1:1 basis; intervention families will be
   offered the E-PAtS programme immediately, continuing to receive usual
   practice, and control participants will be offered the opportunity to
   attend the E-PAtS programme at the end of the follow-up period and will
   continue to receive usual practice. Data will be collected at baseline,
   3months post-randomisation and 12months post-randomisation. The primary
   aim is to assess feasibility via the assessment of: recruitment of
   service provider organisations; participant recruitment; randomisation;
   retention; intervention adherence; intervention fidelity and the views
   of participants, intervention facilitators and service provider
   organisations regarding intervention delivery and study processes. The
   secondary aim is preliminary evaluation of a range of established
   outcome measures for individual family members, subsystem relationships
   and overall family functioning, plus additional health economic outcomes
   for inclusion in a future definitive trial.DiscussionThe results of this
   study will inform a potential future definitive trial, to evaluate the
   effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the E-PAtS intervention to
   improve parental psychosocial wellbeing. Such a trial would have
   significant scientific impact internationally in the intellectual
   disability field.Trial registrationISRCTN70419473},

Title = {Implementing nudges for suicide prevention in real-world environments:
   project INSPIRE study protocol},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Background: Suicide is a global health issue. There are a number of
   evidence-based practices for suicide screening, assessment, and
   intervention that are not routinely deployed in usual care settings. The
   goal of this study is to develop and test implementation strategies to
   facilitate evidence-based suicide screening, assessment, and
   intervention in two settings where individuals at risk for suicide are
   especially likely to present: primary care and specialty mental health
   care. We will leverage methods from behavioral economics, which involves
   understanding the many factors that influence human decision making, to
   inform strategy development.
   Methods: We will identify key mechanisms that limit implementation of
   evidence-based suicide screening, assessment, and intervention practices
   in primary care and specialty mental health through contextual inquiry
   involving behavioral health and primary care clinicians. Second, we will
   use contextual inquiry results to systematically design a menu of
   behavioral economics-informed implementation strategies that cut across
   settings, in collaboration with an advisory board composed of key
   stakeholders (i.e., behavioral economists, clinicians, implementation
   scientists, and suicide prevention experts). Finally, we will conduct
   rapid-cycle trials to test and refine the menu of implementation
   strategies. Primary outcomes include clinician-reported feasibility and
   acceptability of the implementation strategies.
   Discussion: Findings will elucidate ways to address common and unique
   barriers to evidence-based suicide screening, assessment, and
   intervention practices in primary care and specialty mental health care.
   Results will yield refined, pragmatically tested strategies that can
   inform larger confirmatory trials to combat the growing public health
   crisis of suicide.},

Abstract = {BackgroundChildren from low-income families experience accelerated BMI
   gain and learning loss during summer. Healthy Summer Learners (HSL)
   addresses accelerated BMI gain and academic learning loss during summer
   by providing academic- and health-focused programming. This manuscript
   reports the effects of HSL on underlying obesogenic behaviors (i.e.,
   physical activity, screen time, sleep, diet) that lead to accelerated
   summer BMI gain, a necessary first step to informing a future randomized
   controlled trial of HSL.MethodsIn the summer of 2018 and 2019 using a
   quasi-experimental study design, 180 children (90 per summer, 7.9years
   {[}SD = 1.0], 94\% non-Hispanic Black, 40\% male) at two schools (i.e.,
   one per summer) who were struggling academically (25-75\% on a

   health- and academic-focused summer program (i.e., HSL, n = 60), a 4- to

   Learning program (21C), n = 60), or no summer program (n = 60). Children
   wore the Fitbit Charge 2 (TM) over a 10-week period during the summers
   (June-Aug) of 2018-2019. Differences within (within child days attend
   vs. not attend) and between (differences between groups attend vs. not
   attend) were evaluated using mixed effects linear
   regression.ResultsRegression estimates indicated that, on days
   attending, HSL children experienced a greater reduction in sedentary
   minutes (- 58.6 {[}95\% CI = - 92.7, - 24.4]) and a greater increase in
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (36.2 {[}95\% CI = 25.1,
   47.3]) and steps (2799.2 {[}95\% CI = 2114.2, 3484.2]) compared to 21C
   children. However, both HSL and 21C children were more active (i.e.,
   greater MVPA, total steps) and less sedentary (i.e., less sedentary
   minutes and total screen time) and displayed better sleeping patterns
   (i.e., earlier and less variability in sleep onset and offset) on days
   they attended than children in the control.ConclusionsHSL produced
   greater changes in physical activity than 21C. However, attendance at
   either HSL or 21C leads to more healthy obesogenic behaviors. Based on
   the behavioral data in this pilot study, a larger trial may be
   warranted. These results must be considered along with the pending
   primary outcomes (i.e., academics and BMI z-score) of the HSL pilot to
   determine if a full-scale trial is warranted.Trial

Title = {Acupuncture or auricular electro-acupuncture as adjuncts to lifestyle
   interventions for weight management in PCOS: protocol for a randomised
   controlled feasibility study},

Abstract = {BackgroundPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent women's health
   condition with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological
   manifestations. Weight loss can improve these symptoms and is a key
   goal; however, many women find this difficult to achieve. Acupuncture is
   a Chinese medical treatment that involves insertion of very fine metal
   needles into specific areas of the body and has been shown to be
   efficacious for weight loss in non-PCOS populations. However, few
   studies have been conducted in women with PCOS. A variant of
   acupuncture, auricular electro-acupuncture (AEA), may have beneficial
   effects on sympathetic tone, which is associated with insulin
   resistance, obesity and PCOS.MethodsThis prospective three-arm open
   label parallel randomised controlled trial will assess feasibility and
   acceptability of acupuncture and/or AEA for weight loss in women with
   PCOS. We will enrol 39 women from the community aged between 18 and
   45years, with physician diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam
   criteria: body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 40kg/m(2). Women will be
   randomly allocated to receive one of three treatments for 12weeks
   duration: body electro-acupuncture + lifestyle interventions, AEA +
   lifestyle interventions, or lifestyle interventions alone. The lifestyle
   intervention in this study is telephone-based health coaching (between 4
   and 13 phone calls, depending on individual need), provided by the Get
   Healthy Service. Primary outcomes of the study are feasibility and
   acceptability of trial methods as determined by recruitment and
   retention rates, adherence, acceptability, credibility, and safety.
   Secondary outcomes include anthropometric (body weight, BMI, waist and
   hip circumference), metabolic (glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity
   obtained from a 2-h 75g oral glucose tolerance test with area under the
   curve insulin calculated using the trapezoid rule), reproductive
   (androgen levels, menstrual cyclicity, clinical hyperandrogenism using
   the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system), autonomic (heart rate variability,
   blood pressure), lifestyle (physical activity levels, diet quality,
   weight self-efficacy), quality of life, and psychological (depression
   and anxiety symptoms, internal health locus of control).DiscussionThis
   study addresses the feasibility and acceptability of novel interventions
   to treat overweight/obesity in PCOS. Study findings have the potential
   to generate a new understanding of the role of acupuncture and auricular
   acupuncture in weight management.Trial registrationAustralian New

Abstract = {BackgroundWorking in good jobs is associated with good health. High
   unemployment rates are reported in those disabled with musculoskeletal
   pain. Supported employment interventions work well for helping people
   with mental health difficulties to gain and retain employment. With
   adaptation, these may be useful for people with chronic pain. We aimed
   to develop and explore the feasibility of delivering such an adapted
   intervention.MethodsWe developed an intervention and recruited
   unemployed people with chronic pain from NHS pain clinics and employment
   services. We trained case managers to assess participants and match them
   to six-week work placements in the Midlands and provide ongoing support
   to them and their managers. Participants attended a two-day work
   preparation session prior to placement. Outcome measures included
   quality of life at baseline, six-weeks, 14-weeks, and six-months, and
   return to work at 14-weeks and six-months. We held focus groups or
   interviews with stakeholders to examine acceptability and experiences of
   the intervention.ResultsWe developed an intervention consisting of work
   preparation sessions, work experience placements, and individualised
   employment support. We enrolled 31 people; 27 attended work preparation
   sessions, and 15 attended placements. Four of our participants started
   jobs during the study period. We are aware of two others starting jobs
   shortly after cessation of follow-up. We experienced challenges to
   recruitment in one area where we had many and diverse placement
   opportunities and good recruitment in another area where we had a
   smaller range of placement opportunities. All stakeholders found the
   intervention acceptable, and it was valued by those given a placement.
   While there was some disappointment among those not placed, this group
   still valued the work preparation sessions.ConclusionsThe developed
   intervention was acceptable to participants and partners. Trialling the
   developed intervention could be feasible with attention to three main
   processes. To ensure advanced availability of a sufficiently wide range
   of work placements in each area, multiple partners would be needed.
   Multiple recruitment sites and focus on employment services will yield
   better recruitment rates than reliance on NHS pain clinics. Maintaining
   an adequate follow-up response rate will likely require additional
   approaches with more than the usual effort.},

Title = {Study protocol for POSITIF, a randomised multicentre feasibility trial

Abstract = {BackgroundApproximately, half of stroke survivors experience fatigue.
   Fatigue may persist for many months and interferes with participation in
   everyday activities and has a negative impact on social and family
   relationships, return to work, and quality of life. Fatigue is among the
   top 10 priorities for `Life after Stroke' research for stroke survivors,
   carers, and clinicians. We previously developed and tested in a small
   uncontrolled pilot study a manualised, clinical psychologist-delivered,
   face-to-face intervention, informed by cognitive behavioural therapy
   (CBT). We then adapted it for delivery by trained therapists via
   telephone. We now aim to test the feasibility of this approach in a
   parallel group, randomised controlled feasibility trial (Post Stroke
   Intervention Trial In Fatigue, POSITIF).Methods/designPOSITIF aims to
   recruit 75 stroke survivors between 3months and 2years post-stroke who
   would like treatment for their fatigue. Eligible consenting stroke
   survivors will be randomised to either a 7-session manualised
   telephone-delivered intervention based on CBT principles plus
   information about fatigue, or information only. The aims of the
   intervention are to (i) provide an explanation for post-stroke fatigue,
   in particular that it is potentially reversible (an educational
   approach), (ii) encourage participants to overcome the fear of taking
   physical activity and challenge negative thinking (a cognitive approach)
   and (iii) promote a balance between daily activities, rest and sleep and
   then gradually increase levels of physical activity (a behavioural
   approach). Fatigue, mood, quality of life, return to work and putative
   mediators will be assessed at baseline (just before randomisation), at
   the end of treatment and 6 months after randomisation. POSITIF will
   determine the feasibility of recruitment, adherence to the intervention
   and the resources required to deliver the intervention in a larger
   trial.DiscussionThe POSITIF feasibility trial will recruit until 31
   January 2020. Data will inform the utility and design of a future
   adequately powered randomised controlled trial.Trial

Title = {A co-production approach guided by the behaviour change wheel to develop

Abstract = {BackgroundStroke survivors are highly sedentary; thus, breaking up long
   uninterrupted bouts of sedentary behaviour could have substantial health
   benefit. However, there are no intervention strategies specifically
   aimed at reducing sedentary behaviour tailored for stroke survivors. The
   purpose of this study was to use co-production approaches to develop an
   intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour after stroke.MethodsA series
   of five co-production workshops with stroke survivors, their caregivers,
   stroke service staff, exercise professionals, and researchers were
   conducted in parallel in two-stroke services (England and Scotland).
   Workshop format was informed by the behaviour change wheel (BCW)
   framework for developing interventions and incorporated systematic
   review and empirical evidence. Taking an iterative approach, data from
   activities and audio recordings were analysed following each workshop
   and findings used to inform subsequent workshops, to inform both the
   activities of the next workshop and ongoing intervention
   development.FindingsCo-production workshop participants (n = 43)
   included 17 staff, 14 stroke survivors, six caregivers and six
   researchers. The target behaviour for stroke survivors is to increase
   standing and moving, and the target behaviour for caregivers and staff
   is to support and encourage stroke survivors to increase standing and
   moving. The developed intervention is primarily based on co-produced
   solutions to barriers to achieving the target behaviour. The developed
   intervention includes 34 behaviour change techniques. The intervention
   is to be delivered through stroke services, commencing in the inpatient
   setting and following through discharge into the community. Participants
   reported that taking part in intervention development was a positive
   experience.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study that has
   combined the use of co-production and the BCW to develop an intervention
   for use in stroke care. In-depth reporting of how a co-production
   approach was combined with the BCW framework, including the design of
   bespoke materials for workshop activities, should prove useful to other
   researchers and practitioners involved in intervention development in
   stroke.},

Abstract = {BackgroundFrailty is characterised by increased vulnerability to falls,
   disability, hospitalisation and care home admission. However, it is
   relatively reversible in the early stages. Older people living with
   frailty often have multiple health and social issues which are difficult
   to address but could benefit from proactive, person-centred care.
   Personalised care planning aims to improve outcomes through better
   self-management, care coordination and access to community
   resources.MethodsThis feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial
   aims to recruit 400 participants from 11 general practice clusters
   across Bradford and Leeds in the north of England. Eligible patients
   will be aged over 65 with an electronic frailty index score of 0.21
   (identified via their electronic health record), living in their own
   homes, without severe cognitive impairment and not in receipt of end of
   life care. After screening for eligible patients, a restricted 1:1
   cluster-level randomisation will be used to allocate practices to the
   PROSPER intervention, which will be delivered over 12weeks by a personal
   independence co-ordinator worker, or usual care. Following initial
   consent, participants will complete a baseline questionnaire in their
   own home including measures of health-related quality of life,
   activities of daily living, depression and health and social care
   resource use. Follow-up will be at six and 12months. Feasibility
   outcomes relate to progression criteria based around recruitment,
   intervention delivery, retention and follow-up. An embedded process
   evaluation will contribute to iterative intervention optimisation and
   logic model development by examining staff training, intervention
   implementation and contextual factors influencing delivery and uptake of
   the intervention.DiscussionWhilst personalised care planning can improve
   outcomes in long-term conditions, implementation in routine settings is
   poor. We will evaluate the feasibility of conducting a cluster
   randomised controlled trial of personalised care planning in a community
   population based on frailty status. Key objectives will be to test
   fidelity of trial design, gather data to refine sample size calculation
   for the planned definitive trial, optimise data collection processes and
   optimise the intervention including training and delivery.Trial

Abstract = {BackgroundThe World Health Organization recommends 30 min of tummy time
   daily for improved motor development and reduced likelihood of
   plagiocephaly. As only 30\% of infants meet this recommendation, parents
   require strategies and support to increase this proportion.MethodsThe
   aim of this study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and
   potential efficacy of a group intervention to promote tummy time. The
   design is a cluster randomized controlled trial with concealed
   allocation, assessor blinding, and intention-to-treat analysis. Five
   groups of healthy infants (N = 35, baseline mean (SD) age 5.9 (2.8)
   weeks) and their mothers attending local mother's groups (Australia)
   were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. The
   intervention group received group tummy time classes in addition to
   usual care. The control group received usual care with their child and
   family health nurse. Primary outcomes were intervention feasibility and
   acceptability. Secondary outcomes were tummy time duration
   (accelerometry), adherence to physical activity guidelines, head shape,
   and motor development. Measures were taken at baseline,
   post-intervention, and when infants were 6months of age. Analyses were
   by linear mixed models and Cohen's d statistic.ResultsRecruitment,
   retention, and collection of objective data met feasibility targets.
   Acceptability was also met with intervention mothers reporting the
   information, goal planning, and handouts significantly more useful and
   relevant than control group mothers (p < 0.01). Moderate effect sizes
   were also found at post-intervention for tummy time duration, adherence
   to physical activity guidelines and infant ability in prone and supine

Title = {A feasibility study on two tailored interventions to improve adherence
   in adults with haemophilia},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {IntroductionHaemophilia is a congenital bleeding disorder mainly
   affecting males. To prevent bleeding, patients need to perform regular
   intravenous injections (prophylaxis) throughout life. Non-adherence
   often occurs. Problems with acceptance or self-management appear to be
   the main reasons for non-adherence in haemophilia. The aim of this study
   was to test the feasibility and effects of two interventions focussed on
   acceptance (face-to-face) and self-management (online).MethodsPatients
   with severe haemophilia and acceptance or self-management problems were
   eligible. The face-to-face group intervention was based on Acceptance
   and Commitment Therapy (ACT) (8 sessions/6months, target N = 8
   participants). The online intervention was based on a successful online
   programme in rheumatoid arthritis (5-8 modules/2months, target N = 8).
   Both interventions were designed according to the MRC framework in
   collaboration with the patient society and experts. We compared
   adherence (VERITAS-Pro, optimum 0), quality of life (SF-36, optimum 100)
   and illness perception (BIPQ, optimum 0) before start (T0) and after 2
   months (T2). Feasibility criteria were as follows: completion of
   training by > 50\% of participants and ability to collect at least 80\%
   of outcome parameters.ResultsThe face-to-face intervention was feasible
   (89\% enrolment and recruitment, 100\% retention). One hundred percent
   of the outcome parameters was collected. Results were promising:
   although adherence (VERITAS-Pro) was stable (from 64 to 62 points),
   quality of life (SF-36) showed a clinically relevant improvement (> 5
   points) in five of eight domains. Illness perception (BIPQ) showed a
   clinically relevant increase from 47 to 39 points. Patient evaluation
   was positive.The online intervention, however, was infeasible: enrolment
   was only 20\% (6/30). Only three patients signed informed consent
   (recruitment 10\%), and none completed more than one module (retention
   0\%). Consequently, the online intervention was terminated.ConclusionThe
   face-to-face acceptance intervention was considered feasible with
   promising results. Unfortunately, the online intervention was infeasible
   and therefore terminated. These findings suggest that adapting effective
   interventions to other settings does not guarantee success, despite the
   use of established methodology and patient participation. Population
   differences (only male participants, congenital disease) could be an
   explanation for failure of the online intervention in haemophilia
   despite success in rheumatoid arthritis.Trial registrationNL55883.041.16},

Title = {HALT (Hernia Active Living Trial): protocol for a feasibility study of a
   randomised controlled trial of a physical activity intervention to
   improve quality of life in people with bowel stoma with a

Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {BackgroundParastomal hernia (PSH) can be repaired surgically, but
   results to date have been disappointing, with reported recurrence rates
   of 30 to 76\%. Other types of intervention are therefore needed to
   improve the quality of life of people with PSH. One potential
   intervention is physical activity. We hypothesise that the intervention
   will increase core activation and control across the abdominal wall at a
   site of potential weakness and thus reduce the risk of PSH progression.
   Increases in physical activity will improve body image and quality of
   life (QoL).MethodsSubjects and sampleThere were approximately 20 adults
   with a bowel stoma and PSH. People with previous PSH repair will be
   excluded as well as people who already do core training.Study designThis
   is a feasibility study of a randomised controlled trial with 2months
   follow-up, in 2 sites using mixed methods. Stage 1 involves intervention
   development and in stage 2, intervention and trial parameters will be
   assessed.InterventionA theoretically informed physical activity
   intervention was done, targeting people with PSH.Main outcome of
   feasibility studyThe main outcome is the decision by an independent
   Study Steering Committee whether to proceed to a full randomised
   controlled trial of the intervention.Other outcomesWe will evaluate 4
   intervention parameters-fidelity, adherence, acceptability and safety
   and 3 trial parameters (eligible patients' consent rate, acceptability
   of study design and data availability rates for following
   endpoints):Diagnosis and classification of PSHMuscle activationBody
   composition (BMI, waist circumference)Patient reported outcomes: QoL,
   body image and physical functioningPhysical activity;Psychological
   determinants of physical activityOther dataIncluded are other data such
   as interviews with all participants about the intervention and trial
   procedures.Data analysis and statistical powerAs this is a feasibility
   study, the quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive
   statistics. Audio-recorded qualitative data from interviews will be
   transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically.DiscussionThe feasibility
   and acceptability of key intervention and trial parameters will be used
   to decide whether to proceed to a full trial of the intervention, which
   aims to improve body image, quality of life and PSH progression.Trial

Title = {Bedtime Routines Intervention for Children (BRIC) using an automated

Abstract = {BackgroundThis work concerns the activities in the last hour before bed
   for young children born to first-time parents, so called bedtime
   routines (BTR). These activities include amongst others tooth brushing,
   reading a book, having a bath and avoiding food and drinks before bed.
   Having a set bedtime at a suitable hour is also very important.
   Establishing good bedtime routines has been shown to be really important
   for a number of health, wellbeing, development and social outcomes.
   Currently, there is no evidence-based bedtime routine intervention for
   first-time parents using a novel design (i.e. text messages). Existing
   research has highlighted the importance of bedtime routines and the lack
   of appropriate mechanisms in place for parents who sought
   support.MethodsThe proposed study includes 2 work packages. Work package
   1 focuses on the development of the intervention through a combination
   of qualitative work (1:1 interviews with parents on barriers and
   facilitators on bedtime routines using the Theoretical Domains
   Framework) and an expert group of key stakeholders. Work package 2
   involves a small-scale (n = 50) feasibility and effectiveness study to
   examine proof of concept with first-time parents using text messages to
   communicate the intervention. Quantitative information relating to
   uptake, engagement, retention and effectiveness of the intervention as
   well as qualitative information (focus groups with parents who took part
   in the study) will be collected. Overall, the effectiveness of the
   intervention will be assessed through the APEASE criteria
   (acceptability, practicability, effectiveness, affordability, safety,
   equity).DiscussionThis study can provide initial yet important support
   for further exploration in the field of bedtime routines in more
   complicated family structures (parents with more than 1 child, separated
   families etc.). Also, the implementation of a novel study design (i.e.
   text messages) could lead to considerable cost savings while maintaining
   high retention, uptake and engagement from the participants. Should the
   intervention meet the APEASE criteria, a more comprehensive intervention
   on bedtime routines for first-time parents will be explored in a more
   robust (RCT and longitudinal) approach.Trials registrationDue to the
   nature of the study, no trial registration is currently in place.},

Title = {Development of a conceptual framework for a group-based format of the
   Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise (gLiFE) programme and its
   initial feasibility testing},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise (LiFE) programme
   is a fall prevention programme originally taught in a resource-intensive
   one-to-one format with limited feasibility for large-scale
   implementation. The aim of this paper is to present the conceptual
   framework and initial feasibility evaluation of a group-based LiFE
   (gLiFE) format developed for large-scale implementation.MethodsThe
   conceptual gLiFE framework (part I) is based on three pillars, LiFE
   Activities and Principles, Theory of Behaviour Change and Behaviour
   Change Techniques, and Instruction. The feasibility of gLiFE was tested
   (part II) within a multimodal approach including quantitative
   questionnaires measuring safety, acceptability (1 = best to 7 =
   insufficient), and adherence to the LiFE activities (range=0-14) as well
   as a focus group interview. Exploratory self-reported measures on
   behaviour change including self-determined motivation (range=1-5),
   intention, planning, action control, and habit strength (range=1-6) were
   assessed pre and post intervention. Data analyses were performed using
   descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis.ResultsThe
   development process resulted in a manualised gLiFE concept containing
   standardised information on gLiFE's content and structure. Feasibility
   testing: Six older adults (median=72.8years, 5 female) completed the
   feasibility study and rated safety (median=7.0, IQR=0.3) and
   acceptability as high (median=1, IQR=1). Participants implemented 9.5
   LiFE activities (IQR=4.0) into their daily routines. No adverse events
   occurred during the study. In the focus group, the group format and LiFE
   activities were perceived as positive and important for maintaining
   strength and balance capacity. Self-determined motivation intention,
   planning, and habit strength were rated higher post
   intervention.ConclusionThe developed conceptual gLiFE framework
   represents the basis for a gLiFE format with potential for standardised
   large-scale implementation. Proof-of-concept could be demonstrated in a
   group of community-dwelling older adults at risk of falling. The public
   health potential of gLiFE in terms of (cost-)effectiveness is currently
   being evaluated in a large trial.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov

Abstract = {BackgroundAddressing adolescent pregnancies associated health burden
   demands new ways of organizing maternal and child mental health services
   to meet multiple needs of this group. There is a need to strengthen
   integration of sustainable evidence-based mental health interventions in
   primary health care settings for pregnant adolescents. The proposed
   study is guided by implementation science frameworks with key objective
   of implementing a pilot trial testing a full IPT-G version along with
   IPT-G mini version under the mhGAP/IPT-G service framework and to study
   feasibility of the integrated mhGAP/IPT-G adolescent peripartum
   depression care delivery model and estimate if a low cost and compressed
   version of IPT-G intervention would result in similar size of effect on
   mental health and family functioning as the Full IPT-G. There are two
   sub- studies embedded which are: 1) To identify multi-level system
   implementation barriers and strategies guided by the Consolidated
   Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to enhance perinatal
   mhGAP-depression care and evidence-based intervention integration (i.e.,
   group interpersonal psychotherapy; IPT-G) for pregnant adolescents in
   primary care contexts; 2) To use findings from aim 1 and observational
   data from Maternal and Child Health (MCH) clinics that run within
   primary health care facilities to develop a mental health implementation
   workflow plan that has buy-in from key stakeholders, as well as to
   develop a modified protocol and implementation training manual for
   building health facility staff's capacity in implementing the integrated
   mhGAP/IPT-G depression care.MethodsFor the primary objective of studying
   feasibility of the integrated mhGAP/IPT-G depression care in MCH service
   context for adolescent perinatal depression, we will recruit 90 pregnant
   adolescents to a three-arm pilot intervention (unmasked) trial study
   (IPT-G Full, IPT-G Mini, and wait-list control in the context of mhGAP
   care). Pregnant adolescents ages 13-18, in their 1st-2nd trimester with
   a depression score of 13 and above on EPDS would be recruited. Proctor's
   implementation evaluation model will be used. Feasibility and
   acceptability of the intervention implementation and size of effects on
   mental health and family functioning will be estimated using mixed
   method data collection from caregivers of adolescents, adolescents, and
   health care providers. In the two sub-studies, stakeholders representing
   diverse perspectives will be recruited and focus group discussions data
   will be gathered. For aim 2, to build capacity for mhGAP-approach of
   adolescent depression care and research, the implementation-capacity
   training manual will be applied to train 20 providers, 12 IPT-G
   implementers/health workers and 16 Kenyan researchers. Acceptability and
   appropriateness of the training approach will be assessed. Additional
   feedback related to co-located service delivery model, task-shifting and
   task-sharing approach of IPT-G delivery will be gathered for further
   manual improvement.DiscussionThis intervention and service design are in
   line with policy priority of Government of Kenya, Kenya Vision 2030,
   World Health Organization, and UN Sustainable Development Goals that
   focus on improving capacity of mental health service systems to reduce
   maternal, child, adolescent health and mental health disparities in
   LMICs. Successfully carrying out this study in Kenya will provide an
   evidence-based intervention service development and implementation model
   for adolescents in other Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries.

Abstract = {BackgroundOlder adults suffering partial tooth loss may need additional
   intervention strategies other than natural tooth replacement alone to
   improve their nutritional status. This study aimed to design and develop
   a habit-based tailored dietary intervention and to assess the
   feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, in conjunction with
   natural tooth replacement, amongst partially dentate older
   adults.MethodsThe design and development of the dietary intervention
   (phase 1) consisted of analysis of the target population's dietary
   intake and qualitative research through focus groups with
   community-dwelling older adults (aged 65 years and over). The dietary
   intervention consisted of forming three healthy dietary habits around
   fruits and vegetables, wholegrains and healthy proteins. Feasibility of
   the intervention was then tested amongst older adults who had recently
   completed dental treatment for natural tooth replacement in a small
   non-randomised single arm study (phase 2). The principal feasibility
   outcome was the usability and acceptability of the intervention which
   was measured using evaluation questionnaires and by conducting
   post-intervention semi-structured interviews. Supporting outcomes
   consisted of feasibility of screening procedures, recruitment strategies
   and retention/attrition rates as well as the participant's compliance to
   the intervention assessed through self-monitoring tracking
   sheets.ResultsTwenty-one older adults (mean {[}SD] age 72.1 {[}10.4].)
   took part in one of four focus group discussions (phase 1). Twelve
   themes related to barriers (e.g. oral health, appetite) and facilitators
   (e.g. nutritional knowledge, retirement) of healthy eating guided
   intervention development, as did a further five themes when asked for
   direct intervention feedback. Nine older adult participants (mean {[}SD]
   age 72.5{[}9.7]) were recruited into the feasibility study (phase 2)
   where eight themes were identified from feedback interview discussions.
   The principal outcome measures identified intervention feasibility as
   participants considered the intervention acceptable and useable as both
   the evaluation questionnaire and qualitative interview results were
   overwhelmingly positive. As a supporting outcome measure, strong
   intervention compliance was also achieved. Screening procedures were
   accepted but additional recruitment strategies (e.g. incorporation of
   home study visits or recruitment via posters advertisement) may benefit
   future study enrolment and retention.ConclusionPhase 1 and phase 2
   findings have allowed for an iterative, user-driven intervention to be
   developed and refined for a randomised control study to evaluate the
   intervention's effectiveness.Trial registrationISRCTN66118345},

Abstract = {BackgroundPostural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is an
   autonomic nervous system disorder causing an abnormal cardiovascular
   response to upright posture. It affects around 0.2\% of the population,
   most commonly women aged 13 to 50years. POTS can be debilitating;
   prolonged episodes of pre-syncope and fatigue can severely affect
   activities of daily living and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
   Medical treatment is limited and not supported by randomised controlled
   trial (RCT) evidence. Lifestyle interventions are first-line treatment,
   including increased fluid and salt intake, compression tights and
   isometric counter-pressure manoeuvres to prevent fainting. Observational
   studies and small RCTs suggest exercise training may improve symptoms
   and HRQoL in POTS, but evidence quality is low.MethodsSixty-two people
   (aged 18-40years) with a confirmed diagnosis of POTS will be invited to
   enrol on a feasibility RCT with embedded qualitative study. The primary
   outcome will be feasibility; process-related measures will include the
   number of people eligible, recruited, randomised and withdrawn, along
   with indicators of exercise programme adherence and acceptability.
   Secondary physiological, clinical and health-related outcomes including
   sub-maximal recumbent bike exercise test, active stand test and HRQoL
   will be measured at 4 and 7months post-randomisation by researchers
   blinded to treatment allocation. The PostUraL tachycardia Syndrome
   Exercise (PULSE) intervention consists of (1) individual assessment; (2)
   12-week, once to twice-weekly, supervised out-patient exercise training;
   (3) behavioural and motivational support; and (4) guided lifestyle
   physical activity. The control intervention will be best-practice usual
   care with a single 30-min, one-to-one practitioner appointment, and
   general advice on safe and effective physical activity. For the embedded
   qualitative study, participants (n = 10 intervention, n = 10 control)
   will be interviewed at baseline and 4months post-randomisation to assess
   acceptability and the feasibility of progressing to a definitive
   trial.DiscussionThere is very little high-quality research investigating
   exercise rehabilitation for people with POTS. The PULSE study will be
   the first randomised trial to assess the feasibility of conducting a
   definitive multicentre RCT testing supervised exercise rehabilitation
   with behavioural and motivational support, compared to best-practice
   usual care, for people with POTS.Trial registrationISRCTN45323485

Title = {Strengthening health systems response to violence against women:
   protocol to test approaches to train health workers in India},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {BackgroundGlobally, including in low- and middle-income {[}LMIC]
   countries, there is increased attention to and investment in
   interventions to prevent and respond to violence against women; however,
   most of these approaches are delivered outside of formal or informal
   health systems. The World Health Organization published clinical and
   policy guidelines Responding to intimate partner violence and sexual
   violence against women in 2013. Further evidence is needed concerning
   implementation of the Guidelines, including how health care providers
   perceive training interventions, if the training approach meets their
   needs and is of relevance to them and how to ensure sustainability of
   changes in practice due to training. This manuscript describes a study
   protocol for a mixed methods study of the implementation of the
   Guidelines and related tools in tertiary hospitals in two districts in
   Maharashtra, India.MethodsThe study will employ a mixed-methods study
   design. A quantitative assessment of health care providers' and
   managers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices will be conducted pre,
   post, and 6months after the training. Qualitative methods will include a
   participatory stakeholders' meeting to inform the design of the training
   intervention design, in-depth interviews {[}IDIs] and focus-group
   discussions {[}FGDs] with health care providers and managers 3-6months
   after training, and IDIs with women who have disclosed violence to a
   trained health care provider, approximately 6months after training. The
   study will also validate two tools: a readiness assessment of health
   facilities and a health management information system form in a facility
   register format which will be used to document cases of
   violence.DiscussionThe multiple components of this study will generate
   data to improve our understanding of how implementation of the
   Guidelines works, what barriers and facilitators to implementation exist
   in this context, and how current implementation practices result in
   changes in terms of health services and providers' practices of
   responding to women affected by violence. The results will be useful for
   governmental and non-governmental and United Nations Agency efforts to
   improve health systems and services for women affected by violence, as
   well as for researchers working on health systems responses to violence
   against women in India and possibly other contexts.},

Title = {Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy for problem gambling in
   routine care: protocol for a non-randomized pilot and feasibility trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {BackgroundProblem gambling and gambling disorder are major public health
   concerns worldwide, and awareness of associated negative consequences is
   rising. In parallel, treatment demand has increased, and Internet
   interventions offer a promising alternative for providing evidence-based
   treatment at scale to a low cost.MethodWe developed a novel
   Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral treatment for gambling, based on
   qualitative interviews with treatment-seeking gamblers, behavioral
   research on gambling behavior, and the pathway model for problem
   gambling. This research protocol describes a non-randomized pilot and
   feasibility trial conducted in routine addiction care with adult
   treatment-seeking patients (max N = 25) with problem gambling. The
   primary aim is to ensure acceptability and safety, measured by
   satisfaction, credibility, working alliance, and possible negative
   effects. Secondary aims are feasibility of study procedures in terms of
   recruitment and measurement procedures as well as potential
   effectiveness measured weekly by gambling symptoms as primary outcome
   and gambling behavior, quality of life, symptoms of depression and
   anxiety, alcohol, and drug use as secondary outcomes. Potential
   mediators measured weekly are loss of control, verbal rules, and
   well-being.DiscussionThis study is innovative in several respects,
   regarding both treatment development and implementation. The results of
   the study will guide a future randomized controlled trial, as well as
   the development of the intervention and intervention implementation
   within ordinary addiction care.Trial registrationClinical trials.gov,

Title = {A feasibility, acceptability and fidelity study of a multifaceted

Abstract = {BackgroundDespite the benefits of physical activity for walking ability,
   balance, and mood, less than 30\% of stroke survivors engage in
   recommended levels of physical activity with high levels of sedentary
   behaviour observed. This study aims to assess the feasibility,
   acceptability and fidelity of a theory- and evidence-based multifaceted
   behaviour change intervention targeting free-living physical activity
   and sedentary behaviour after stroke.MethodsThis study will be set in
   community stroke services in the North East of England and will assess
   the feasibility of a behaviour change intervention targeting free-living
   physical activity and sedentary behaviour of stroke survivors and
   consultation behaviour of the healthcare professionals to support stroke
   survivors to make these lifestyle changes. Up to 35 stroke survivors
   currently receiving stroke rehabilitation within the study catchment
   area with capacity and no contraindications to increasing physical
   activity/reducing sedentary behaviour will be recruited. Stroke
   survivors will receive a supported self-management physical
   activity/sedentary behaviour programme incorporating provision of
   information, goal setting, action planning, barrier identification,
   coping planning, self-monitoring and feedback on physical activity and
   sedentary behaviour. The programme will be supported by up to 12
   healthcare professionals (HCPs) recruited from the community stroke
   services taking part in the study. The HCPs will deliver at least two
   face-to-face sessions (baseline, review and subsequent reviews if
   necessary) and provide a range of personalised tools to support each
   individual stroke survivor (e.g. workbook, self-monitoring tools,
   information on local resources). The consultation behaviour of the HCPs
   will be targeted via a training programme incorporating face-to-face
   training, a training manual and individual feedback on intervention
   programme delivery from the study research team. The feasibility,
   acceptability and fidelity of the study protocol will be
   assessed.DiscussionThe most effective methods of supporting stroke
   survivors to alter physical activity and sedentary behaviour have yet to
   be established. This study will establish the feasibility of delivering
   a complex theory- and evidence-based intervention targeting the
   behaviour of both stroke survivors and HCPs and assess whether it is
   acceptable to the target populations. Findings will inform the iterative
   development of the intervention before a larger scale evaluation.Trial

Title = {Assessing the effectiveness of a comprehensive menstrual health
   intervention program in Ugandan schools (MENISCUS): process evaluation
   of a pilot intervention study},

Abstract = {BackgroundPoor menstrual health and hygiene (MHH) is a globally
   recognised public health challenge. A pilot study of an MHH intervention
   was conducted in two secondary schools in Entebbe, Uganda, over 9
   months. The intervention included five components delivered by the
   implementing partner (WoMena Uganda) and the research team: (i) training
   teachers to implement government guidelines for puberty education, (ii)
   a drama skit to reduce stigma about menstruation, (iii) training in use
   of a menstrual kit (including re-usable pads), (iv) guidance on pain
   relief methods including provision of analgesics and (v) improvements to
   school water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities. The aim of the
   process evaluation was to examine implementation, context and possible
   causal pathways.MethodsWe collected information on fidelity, dose,
   reach, acceptability, context and mechanisms of impact using (i)
   quantitative survey data collected from female and male students in year
   2 of secondary school (ages 13-21; 450 at the baseline and 369 at
   endline); (ii) qualitative data from 40 in-depth interviews with
   parents, teachers and female students, and four focus group discussions
   with students, stratified by gender; (iii) data from unannounced visits
   checking on WASH facilities throughout the study; and (iv) routine data
   collected as part of the implementation. Quantitative data were used
   primarily to assess fidelity, dose and reach. Qualitative data were used
   primarily to assess acceptability, context and possible
   mechanisms.ResultsBoth schools received all intervention elements that
   were delivered by the research team and implementing partner. The drama
   skit, menstrual kit and pain management intervention components were
   delivered with fidelity. Intervention components that relied on school
   ownership (puberty education training and WASH improvements) were not
   fully delivered. Overall, the intervention was acceptable to
   participants. Multilevel contextual factors including schools' social
   and physical environment, and family, cultural and social factors
   influenced the acceptability of the intervention in the school setting.
   The intervention components reinforced one another, as suggested in our
   theoretical framework.ConclusionThe intervention was feasible to deliver
   and acceptable to the schools and students. We propose a full-scale
   cluster-randomised trial to evaluate the intervention, adding a
   school-based MHH leadership group to address issues with school
   ownership.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04064736. Registered

Title = {Body, Soul and Spirit, an adaptation of two evidence-based interventions
   to promote physical activity and healthy eating among adults in churches
   in Lagos Nigeria: a three-arm cluster randomized controlled pilot trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {BackgroundPhysical inactivity and unhealthy eating are two leading
   behavioral risk factors contributing to preventable non-communicable
   diseases (NCDs). Evidence-based interventions (EBI) using
   community-engaged approaches to address these risks abound in
   high-income countries. Comparatively, evidence of such interventions is
   sparse in low- and middle-income countries, where NCD mortality is
   greater. This paper describes the protocol for the development of the
   cultural adaptation and pilot testing of a combination of two EBI (i.e.,
   Body and Soul and the Healthy Body Healthy Spirit), in church-based
   settings in Lagos, Nigeria. In addition, we describe the development of
   the inclusion of an additional component, i.e., faith-based text
   messages, into one of the treatment arms. Our objective is to assess the
   feasibility of developing and implementing the adapted interventions
   with the ultimate aim of developing a fully powered trial.MethodsThis
   pilot study will assess the design and implementation of a three-arm
   cluster-randomized pilot trial in 12 randomly selected Anglican churches
   (4 in each arm). First, we will design a cultural adaptation of the two
   EBI's to form a multifaceted combined intervention known as the Body
   Soul and Spirit. The second treatment arm, i.e., Body Soul and Spirit
   Plus, will retain all the components of Body Soul and Spirit with the
   inclusion of faith-based text messages using mobile phones. Participants
   in the control arm will receive information leaflets designed to
   increase physical activity and healthy food consumption. The outcome
   measures include participant recruitment and retention, program
   participation and satisfaction, and data collection completion rates.
   The outcomes for the proposed definitive trial will be the number of
   servings of fruit and vegetables and minutes of moderate to vigorous
   physical activity per day will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6-month
   follow-up. Implementation outcomes will be assessed using qualitative
   and quantitative methods.DiscussionThe study will enhance the
   understanding of how best to design and implement behavioral
   interventions in church-based settings using community-based
   participatory approaches. It will also inform the development of a
   definitive randomized controlled trial.Trial registrationPan African

Abstract = {BackgroundMost severe mental disorders have their onset between the age
   of 17 and 27, a time when many young adults begin participating in
   secondary or post-secondary education. The cognitive deficits typically
   associated with psychiatric disorders, especially psychotic disorders,
   increase the risk of leaving school early, which can lead to a reduction
   in employment opportunities later on in life and, in turn, a poorer
   long-term prognosis. Therefore, specific interventions aiming to improve
   these cognitive functions are needed. Cognitive remediation (CR) aims to
   improve cognitive functioning and may increase real-world functioning in
   educational performance. This study aims to examine the feasibility and
   applicability of a CR training named Mindset for students with psychotic
   disorders in the Netherlands.Methods/designSixty students diagnosed with
   a psychotic disorder and currently reporting cognitive deficits will be
   included from four Dutch Mental Health Care institutes. Half of the
   participants (N = 30) will be randomly assigned to the CR training
   consisting of twelve, individual, weekly 1-h meetings. The other half
   will be assigned to an active control condition consisting of twelve
   weekly assignments that will be sent by email aiming to improve school
   performance. Students will be evaluated at baseline (T0), directly after
   finishing the CR training or control intervention (T1), and 6 months
   later (T2). Treatment feasibility will be the primary outcome, using
   evaluation forms, interviews with trainers and participants, number of
   study drop outs, and patient eligibility and recruitment rates. School
   functioning, cognitive functioning, and strategy use will also be
   assessed to get a preliminary idea of the potential effectiveness of the
   intervention.DiscussionThe CR training in this study will provide
   real-world examples and exercises aimed to teach useful strategies to
   cope with the cognitive deficits experienced by students with psychotic
   disorders. Furthermore, since students with other psychiatric disorders
   might also experience cognitive deficits, the results of this study may
   also provide some further implications for future studies on the effect
   of this CR training for students with these disorders.Trial

Title = {Design, rationale and analysis plan for the Stand Up for Health trial in
   contact centres: a stepped wedge feasibility study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {BackgroundContact centres are one of the most sedentary workplaces, with
   employees spending a very high proportion of their working day sitting
   down. About a quarter of contact centre staff regularly experience
   musculoskeletal health problems due to high levels of sedentary
   behaviour, including lower back pain. There have been no previous
   randomised studies specifically aiming to reduce sedentary behaviour in
   contact centre staff. To address this gap, the Stand Up for Health (SUH)
   study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of a complex
   theory-based intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour in contact
   centres.MethodsThe Stand Up for Health study has a stepped wedge cluster
   randomised trial design, which is a pragmatic design whereby clusters
   (contact centres) are randomised to time points at which they will begin
   to receive the intervention. All contact centre staff have the
   opportunity to experience the intervention. To minimise the resource
   burden in this feasibility study, data collection is not continuous, but
   undertaken on a selective number of occasions, so the stepped wedge
   design is ``incomplete{''}. Eleven contact centres in England and
   Scotland have been recruited, and the sample size is approximately 27
   per centre (270 in total). The statistical analysis will predominantly
   focus on assessing feasibility, including the calculation of recruitment
   rates and rates of attrition. Exploratory analysis will be performed to
   compare objectively measured sedentary time in the workplace (measured
   using an activPAL (TM) device) between intervention and control
   conditions using a linear mixed effects regression model.DiscussionTo
   our knowledge, this is the first stepped wedge feasibility study
   conducted in call centres. The rationale and justification of our novel
   staircase stepped wedge design has been presented, and we hope that by
   presenting our study design and statistical analysis plan, it will
   contribute to the literature on stepped wedge trials, and in particular
   feasibility stepped wedge trials. The findings of the study will also
   help inform whether this is a suitable design for other settings where
   data collection is challenging.Trial registrationThe trial has been
   registered on the ISRCTN database: http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN11580369},

Abstract = {Background: Implementation trials aim to test the effects of
   implementation strategies on the adoption, integration or uptake of an
   evidence-based intervention within organisations or settings.
   Feasibility and pilot studies can assist with building and testing
   effective implementation strategies by helping to address uncertainties
   around design and methods, assessing potential implementation strategy
   effects and identifying potential causal mechanisms. This paper aims to
   provide broad guidance for the conduct of feasibility and pilot studies
   for implementation trials.
   Methods: We convened a group with a mutual interest in the use of
   feasibility and pilot trials in implementation science including
   implementation and behavioural science experts and public health
   researchers. We conducted a literature review to identify existing
   recommendations for feasibility and pilot studies, as well as
   publications describing formative processes for implementation trials.
   In the absence of previous explicit guidance for the conduct of
   feasibility or pilot implementation trials specifically, we used the
   effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial design typology proposed by
   Curran and colleagues as a framework for conceptualising the application
   of feasibility and pilot testing of implementation interventions. We
   discuss and offer guidance regarding the aims, methods, design,
   measures, progression criteria and reporting for implementation
   feasibility and pilot studies.
   Conclusions: This paper provides a resource for those undertaking
   preliminary work to enrich and inform larger scale implementation
   trials.},

Title = {Training attention control of very preterm infants: protocol for a
   feasibility study of the Attention Control Training (ACT)},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {BackgroundChildren born preterm may display cognitive, learning, and
   behaviour difficulties as they grow up. In particular, very premature
   birth (gestation age between 28 and less than 32weeks) may put infants
   at increased risk of intellectual deficits and attention deficit
   disorder. Evidence suggests that the basis of these problems may lie in
   difficulties in the development of executive functions. One of the
   earliest executive functions to emerge around 1year of age is the
   ability to control attention. An eye-tracking-based cognitive training
   programme to support this emerging ability, the Attention Control
   Training (ACT), has been developed and tested with typically developing
   infants. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of
   using the ACT with healthy very preterm (VP) infants when they are
   12months of age (corrected age). The ACT has the potential to address
   the need for supporting emerging cognitive abilities of VP infants with
   an early intervention, which may capitalise on infants' neural
   plasticity.Methods/designThe feasibility study is designed to
   investigate whether it is possible to recruit and retain VP infants and
   their families in a randomised trial that compares attention and social
   attention of trained infants against those that are exposed to a control
   procedure. Feasibility issues include the referral/recruitment pathway,
   attendance, and engagement with testing and training sessions,
   completion of tasks, retention in the study, acceptability of outcome
   measures, quality of data collected (particularly, eye-tracking data).
   The results of the study will inform the development of a larger
   randomised trial.DiscussionSeveral lines of evidence emphasise the need
   to support emerging cognitive and learning abilities of preterm infants
   using early interventions. However, early interventions with preterm
   infants, and particularly very preterm ones, face difficulties in
   recruiting and retaining participants. These problems are also augmented
   by the health vulnerability of this population. This feasibility study
   will provide the basis for informing the implementation of an early
   cognitive intervention for very preterm infants.Trial

Abstract = {BackgroundDomestic violence and abuse (DVA) is common and destructive to
   health. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major mental health
   consequence of DVA. People who have experienced DVA have specific needs,
   arising from the repeated and complex nature of the trauma. The National
   Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends more research on the
   effectiveness of psychological interventions for people who have
   experienced DVA. There is growing evidence that mindfulness-based
   interventions may help trauma symptoms.MethodsIntervention refinement
   and randomized controlled feasibility trial. A prototype trauma-informed
   mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (TI-MBCT) intervention will be
   co-produced following qualitative interviews and consensus exercise with
   stakeholders. Participants in the feasibility trial will be recruited
   from DVA agencies in two geographical regions and randomized to receive
   either TI-MBCT or usual care (self-referral to the Improving Access to
   Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service). TI-MBCT will be delivered as a
   group-based eight-week program. It will not be possible to blind the
   participants or the assessors to the study allocation. The following
   factors will inform the feasibility of progressing to a fully powered
   trial: recruitment, retention, intervention fidelity, and the
   acceptability of the intervention and trial design to participants. We
   will also test the feasibility of measuring the following participant
   outcomes before and 6 months post-randomization: PTSD, dissociative
   symptoms, depression, anxiety, DVA re-victimization, self-compassion,
   and mother-reported child health. Process evaluation and economic
   analysis will be embedded within the feasibility trial.DiscussionThis
   study will lead to the development of a TI-MBCT intervention for DVA
   survivors with PTSD and inform the feasibility and design of a fully
   powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). The full trial will aim to
   determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a TI-MBCT
   intervention in improving the clinically important symptoms of PTSD in
   DVA survivors.Trial registrationISRCTN, ISRCTN64458065, Registered 11

Abstract = {BackgroundTraining speech production skills may be a valid intervention
   target for minimally verbal autistic children. Intervention studies have
   explored various approaches albeit on a small scale and with limited
   experimental control or power. We therefore designed a novel app-based
   parent-mediated intervention based on insights from the video modelling
   and cued articulation literature and tested its acceptability and
   usage.MethodsConsultation with the autism community refined the initial
   design and culminated in a pilot trial (n = 19) lasting 16weeks.
   Participants were randomly allocated an intervention duration in an AB
   phase design and undertook weekly probes during baseline and
   intervention via the app. We evaluated the acceptability of the
   intervention via feedback questionnaires and examined the usability
   variables such as adherence to the testing and intervention schedule,
   time spent on the app and trials completed during the intervention
   phase.ResultsHigh acceptability scores indicated that families liked the
   overall goals and features of the app. Ten participants engaged
   meaningfully with the app, completing 82\% of the test trials and
   uploading data in 61\% of intervention weeks; however, of these, only
   three met the targeted 12.5min of intervention per week.ConclusionWe
   discuss the possible reasons for variability in usage data and how
   barriers to participation could be surmounted in the future development
   of this intervention.},

Abstract = {BackgroundIdentifying and addressing heavy drinking represents a major
   public health priority worldwide. Whilst the majority of alcohol
   screening and brief intervention (ASBI) research has been conducted in
   western, high-income countries, evidence is growing that ASBI can also
   impact positively on heavy drinkers in low- and middle-income country
   populations. This mixed methods study aims to assess the feasibility of
   conducting a fully randomised controlled trial of the effectiveness of
   ASBI in primary care in Kazakhstan and explore the feasibility and
   acceptability of implementing ASBI in this setting from patients' and
   physicians' perspectives.MethodsSix primary health care units in the
   region of Pavlodar will be cluster randomised to either an intervention
   (WHO manualised 5 min alcohol brief intervention plus alcohol leaflet)
   or control group (simple feedback plus alcohol leaflet). Primary
   feasibility measures will be rates of participation at baseline and
   retention of eligible patients at the 3-month follow-up point.
   Patient/physician questionnaires and physician focus groups will assess
   additional dimensions of feasibility, as well as acceptability,
   according to the RE-AIM framework: Reach (rates of eligible patients
   screened/received advice); Effectiveness (change in AUDIT-C score);
   Adoption (rate/representativeness of participating physicians);
   Implementation (quality of ASBI/barriers and facilitators to delivery);
   and Maintenance (potential sustainability of
   intervention).DiscussionThis is the first trial of the feasibility and
   acceptability of ASBI in Kazakhstan. As the planning and assessment of
   implementation determinants is based on the RE-AIM framework, the
   project outcomes will be relevant for the future development, tailoring
   and implementation of ASBI in Kazakhstan.Trial registrationDRKS,

Title = {Protocol for a pilot randomized controlled feasibility study of brief
   interpersonal psychotherapy for addressing social-emotional needs and
   preventing excess gestational weight gain in adolescents},

Abstract = {BackgroundExcess gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnant adolescents
   is a major public health concern. Excess GWG increases risk of pregnancy
   complications as well as postpartum and offspring obesity and
   cardiometabolic disease. Prevention interventions for pregnant adults
   that target lifestyle modification (i.e., healthy eating/physical
   activity) show insufficient effectiveness. Pregnant adolescents have
   distinct social-emotional needs, which may contribute to excess GWG.
   From an interpersonal theoretical framework, conflict and low social
   support increase negative emotions, which in turn promote excess GWG
   through mechanisms such as overeating and physical inactivity.MethodsThe
   current manuscript describes the design of a pilot randomized controlled
   feasibility trial of adolescent interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) to
   address social-emotional needs and prevent excess GWG. Up to 50
   pregnant, healthy adolescents 13-19y, 12-18weeks gestation are recruited
   from an interdisciplinary adolescent maternity hospital clinic and
   randomized to IPT + usual care or usual care alone. IPT involves 6
   individual 60-minute sessions delivered by a trained behavioral health
   clinician during 12-30weeks gestation. Sessions include relationship
   psychoeducation, emotion identification and expression, and
   teaching/role-playing communication skills. Between sessions,
   adolescents are instructed to complete a daily journal and to have
   conversations to work on relationship goals. Outcomes are assessed at
   baseline, mid-program, post-program, and 3-months postpartum. Primary
   outcomes are feasibility and acceptability based upon rate of
   recruitment, session attendance, program acceptability ratings, and
   follow-up retention. Secondary outcomes are perinatal social
   functioning, stress, depression, and eating behaviors assessed with
   validated surveys and interviews; perinatal physical activity and sleep
   measured via accelerometer; GWG from measured weights; and at 3-months
   postpartum only, maternal adiposity by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry,
   maternal insulin sensitivity derived from 2-hour oral glucose tolerance
   testing, and infant adiposity by air displacement
   plethysmography.DiscussionThis pilot trial will address a key gap in
   extant understanding of excess GWG prevention for a high-risk population
   of adolescents. If feasible and acceptable, brief psychotherapy to
   address social-emotional needs should be tested for its effectiveness to
   address excess GWG and postpartum maternal/infant health. If effective,
   such an approach has potential to interrupt an adverse,
   intergenerational cycle of social-emotional distress, obesity, and
   cardiometabolic disease among young mothers and their offspring.Trial

Abstract = {BackgroundSocial support has an important role in successful weight
   loss. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and
   acceptability of an app-, web- and social support-based intervention in
   supporting adults with obesity to achieve weight loss.MethodsThe
   intervention and evaluation methods were tested in a feasibility
   randomised controlled trial. Adults in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde
   Health Board area of Scotland with a body mass index >= 30kg/m(2) were
   recruited and randomised 2:1 (intervention to control). The feasibility
   and acceptability of the intervention and trial methods were assessed
   against pre-specified progression criteria, via process, economic and
   outcome evaluation. Three primary outcomes were explored: BMI, diet and
   physical activity, as well as a number of secondary outcomes. The
   intervention group had access to the HelpMeDoIt! intervention for
   12months. This encouraged them to (i) set goals, (ii) monitor progress
   and (iii) harness social support by inviting `helpers' from their
   existing social network. The control group received a healthy lifestyle
   leaflet.ResultsOne hundred and nine participants were recruited, with 84
   participants (77\%) followed-up at 12months. The intervention and trial
   methods were feasible and acceptable. Participants and helpers were
   generally positive. Of the 54 (74\%) participants who downloaded the
   app, 48 (89\%) used it. Interview data indicated that HelpMeDoIt!
   promoted social support from existing social networks to support weight
   loss. This support was often given outside of the app.Outcomes were
   compared using linear regression models, with randomised group, the
   baseline measurement of the outcome, age and gender as predictor
   variables. These analyses were exploratory and underpowered to detect
   effects. However, all pre-specified primary outcome effects (BMI, diet
   and physical activity) had wide confidence intervals and were therefore
   consistent with clinically relevant benefits. Objective physical
   activity measures perhaps showed most potential (daily step count (p =
   0.098; 1187 steps {[}-180, 2555])) and sedentary time (p = 0.022;
   -60.8min {[}-110.5, -11.0]). However, these outcomes were poorly
   completed.ConclusionsThe study demonstrated that a novel social support
   intervention involving support from participants' close social networks,
   delivered via app and website, has potential to promote weight loss and
   is feasible and acceptable.Trial registrationISRCTN, ISRCTN85615983.

Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {BackgroundTargeting modifiable lifestyle factors including diet and
   physical activity represents a potentially cost-effective strategy that
   could support a growing population of colorectal cancer survivors and
   improve their health outcomes. Currently, effective, evidence-based
   interventions and resources helping people after bowel cancer to adopt
   new lifestyle habits are lacking. The aim of this trial is to test the
   Healthy Eating and Active Lifestyle After Bowel Cancer (HEAL-ABC)
   intervention to inform a future definitive randomised controlled
   trial.Methods/designThis is a feasibility randomised controlled trial. A
   total of 72 survivors who have completed surgery and all anticancer
   treatments will be recruited. The intervention group will receive
   HEAL-ABC resources based on behaviour change theory combined with
   supportive telephone calls informed by motivational interviewing every
   2weeks during the 3-month intervention, and once a month for 6months to
   follow-up. Participants in the control group will follow usual care and
   have access to resources available in the public domain. The study is
   testing feasibility of the intervention including adherence and ability
   to collect data on anthropometry, body composition, diet, physical
   activity, behaviour change, quality of life, blood markers, contact with
   healthcare services, morbidities and overall survival.DiscussionThe
   proposed study will add to the evidence base by addressing an area where
   there is a paucity of data. This study on lifestyle interventions for
   people after colorectal cancer follows the Medical Research Council
   guidance on evaluating complex interventions in clinical practice. It
   focuses on people living after treatment for colorectal cancer and
   targets an important research area identified by cancer survivors as a
   research priority reported by the National Cancer Institute and James
   Lind Alliance UK.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04227353

Title = {Menstrual product choice and uptake among young women in Zimbabwe: a
   pilot study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {BackgroundMenstrual health and hygiene (MHH) is a human rights issue;
   yet, it remains a challenge for many, especially in low- and
   middle-income countries (LMICs). MHH includes the socio-political,
   psychosocial, and environmental factors that impact women's menstrual
   experiences. High proportions of girls and women in LMICs have
   inadequate MHH due to limited access to menstrual knowledge, products,
   and stigma reinforcing harmful myths and taboos. The aim of this pilot
   was to inform the design of an MHH sub-study and the implementation and
   scale-up of an MHH intervention incorporated into a community-based
   cluster-randomized trial of integrated sexual and reproductive health
   (SRH) services for youth in Zimbabwe. The objectives were to investigate
   (1) uptake of a novel MHH intervention, (2) menstrual product
   preference, and (3) the factors that informed uptake and product choice
   among young women.MethodsFemale participants aged 16-24 years old
   attending the community-based SRH services between April and July 2019
   were offered the MHH intervention, which included either a menstrual cup
   or reusable pads, analgesia, and MHH education. Descriptive statistics
   were used to quantitatively assess uptake and product choice. Focus
   group discussions and in-depth interviews with participants and the
   intervention team were used to investigate the factors that influenced
   uptake and product choice.ResultsOf the 1732 eligible participants, 1414
   (81.6\%) took up the MHH intervention at first visit. Uptake differed by
   age group with 84.6\% of younger women (16-19 years old) compared to
   79.0\% of older women (20-24 years old) taking up the intervention.
   There was higher uptake of reusable pads (88.0\%) than menstrual cups
   (12.0\%). Qualitative data highlighted that internal factors, such as
   intervention delivery, influenced uptake. Participants noted the
   importance of access to free menstrual products, analgesics, and MHH
   education in a youth-friendly environment. External factors such as
   sociocultural factors informed product choice. Barriers to cup uptake
   included fears that the cup would compromise young women's
   virginity.ConclusionsPilot findings were used to improve the MHH
   intervention design and implementation as follows: (1) cup ambassadors
   to improve cup promotion, sensitization, and uptake; (2) use of smaller
   softer cups; and (3) education for community members including
   caregivers and partners.Trial registrationRegistry:

Abstract = {BackgroundPhysical activity has many physical and mental health benefits
   and can delay the development of disability in older age. However,
   uptake of this health behaviour is sub-optimal in women in their middle
   and older age. This trial aims to establish the acceptability and
   feasibility of the Active Women over 50 programme involving online
   information, telephone health coaching and email or SMS support to
   promote physical activity behaviour change among women aged 50years and
   over.MethodsSixty community-dwelling women who are insufficiently active
   according to national guidelines, will be recruited and randomised to 1)
   receive the Active Women over 50 programme or 2) a wait-list control.
   Active Women over 50 is a 3-month physical activity programme guided by
   behaviour change science, providing access to a website, one
   telephone-delivered health coaching session from a physiotherapist and 8
   email or 24 SMS messages. The primary outcome is the proportion of
   participants at 3months post-randomisation who would recommend
   participation in the programme to another person like themselves.
   Secondary outcomes are feasibility measures: rates of recruitment,
   retention, completeness of outcome data and uptake of telephone support;
   and intervention impact measures: accelerometer-assessed average
   steps/day, proportion of participants meeting national guidelines on
   moderate to vigorous physical activity; and questionnaire-assessed
   quality of life, exercise perceptions, mood, physical functioning and
   self-reported physical activity. Intervention participants will also
   complete a follow-up survey to assess impressions of the intervention
   and adoption of strategies for physical activity participation. Data
   will be analysed descriptively to guide the design of a larger trial.
   Between-group differences in secondary outcomes will be used to estimate
   effect sizes for sample size calculations for a fully powered randomised
   controlled trial.DiscussionThis feasibility pilot trial of an efficient
   eHealth and health coaching intervention guided by user input and
   behaviour change theory, will inform future interventions to address low
   physical activity participation among an under-active group at risk of
   future disability.Trial registrationANZCTR, ACTRN12619000490178,

Title = {The long-term health and wellbeing impacts of Healthy New Towns (HNTs):

Abstract = {BackgroundIncreasing levels of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), mental
   health problems, high rates of unhealthy behaviours and health
   inequalities remain major public health challenges worldwide. In the
   context of increasing urbanisation, there is an urgent need to
   understand how evidence that living environments shape health, wellbeing
   and behaviour can be used to design and deliver healthy environments in
   local urban settings. The Healthy New Town (HNT) programme implemented
   in England from 2015 consists of ten major housing developments that aim
   to improve population health through healthy design principles, new
   models for integrating health and social care and the creation of strong
   and connected communities. The programme provides a natural experiment
   in which to investigate the effects on health, wellbeing and
   inequalities of large-scale interventions targeting the wider social
   determinants of health.MethodsThe research described in this protocol
   aims to examine the feasibility of a larger study to assess the
   longer-term health impacts of HNTs, by addressing two research
   questions: (1) what are the similarities and differences in the HNT
   programme developments, processes, contexts and expected impacts and
   outcomes across HNT sites? and (2) how feasible is the use of data from
   routine sources and existing HNT evaluations and as the baseline for a
   definitive study to assess impact on health, wellbeing, behavioural and
   economic outcomes and programme processes? The research will consist of
   (a) participatory systems mapping with stakeholders to produce a
   theoretical framework for a longer-term study on the HNT programme, (b)
   synthesis of existing qualitative data from local HNT evaluations to
   understand local processes and intervention mechanisms, (c) scoping
   local and routinely available data to establish a baseline and
   feasibility for a longer-term study of health and economic outcomes, and
   (d) building relationships and recruiting HNT sites into the proposed
   research.DiscussionThe proposed research will produce a theoretical
   framework and assess the feasibility of a definitive study of outcomes
   of the HNT programme. This research is necessary to understand how
   longer-term health, wellbeing, behavioural and economic outcomes can be
   measured, and to inform a definitive study to generate evidence on the
   effectiveness of the HNT programme.},

Title = {Adapting TeamSTEPPS for school mental health teams: a pilot study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},

Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {Background School mental health care often is provided by teams
   contracted from community mental health agencies. The team members that
   provide this care, however, do not typically receive training in how to
   work effectively in a team-based context. Team Strategies and Tools to
   Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS) provides a
   promising, evidence-based strategy for improving communication and
   climate in school-based teams. Methods In collaboration with
   stakeholders, we adapted and piloted TeamSTEPPS for use with school
   mental health teams. Teams in six schools were randomized to receive the
   adapted TeamSTEPPS approach or usual supports. The main outcomes of
   interest were feasibility and acceptability of the adapted TeamSTEPPS
   strategy. Results Results indicated that team member burnout was
   significantly higher at follow-up than pretreatment for both control and
   intervention teams. TeamSTEPPS was feasible and acceptable to implement,
   and leadership emerged as an important facilitator. Barriers to
   implementation success included staff turnover, lack of resources, and
   challenges in the school mental health team relationship. Additional
   supports to implement TeamSTEPPS were suggested, including ongoing
   consultation and booster training to address high staff turnover.
   Conclusions Results suggest that TeamSTEPPS is promising for school
   mental health teams but additional modifications are likely needed.},

Title = {A virtual reality intervention for fear of movement for Veterans with
   chronic pain: protocol for a feasibility study},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background A key concern for people with chronic pain is experiencing
   increased pain and/or re-injury. Consequently, individuals with chronic
   pain can develop a maladaptive fear of movement that leads to adverse
   functional consequences. A primary goal of chronic pain rehabilitation
   is re-engagement in feared movements through exposure. This is often
   challenging since safe movement can be uncomfortable. Virtual
   environments provide a promising opportunity to safely and gradually
   expose Veterans to movements that are avoided in the real world. The
   current study will utilize multiple virtual reality (VR) applications
   (APPs) of varying the intensity levels ranging from passive distraction
   from pain to active exposure to feared movement. The primary aims of
   this pilot are to examine VR as an adjunctive nonpharmacological
   intervention to assist with the adoption and implementation of skills to
   decrease fear of movement and increase overall functioning among
   Veterans with chronic pain. Second, to build a hierarchy of VR APPs to
   assist in gradual exposure to feared movements. Methods This study will
   be conducted in the Chronic Pain Rehabilitation Program (CPRP) at the
   James A. Haley Veterans Hospital, a unique inpatient program within the
   VA system. Participants will include up to 20 Veterans who receive a VR
   intervention as part of their physical therapy. A rating form containing
   qualitative and quantitative experiences will be administered following
   each VR session to assess feasibility and to provide descriptive
   information for the proposed hierarchy. Effect sizes will be calculated
   from intake and discharge measures for the primary outcome fear of
   movement and secondary pain and functional outcomes. Discussion This
   study will inform the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial
   examining the clinical utility of using VR to reduce fear of movement
   and increase function among Veterans with chronic pain. VR has the
   advantage of being easily implemented both within VA healthcare settings
   as well as in Veterans' own residences, where engagement in ongoing
   self-management approaches is often most challenging. Presumably, VR
   that is matched to patient needs, progresses in intensity, immerses
   Veterans in the applications, and is perceived positively by Veterans,
   will result in positive functional outcomes.},

Title = {A feasibility study of `The StepSmart Challenge' to promote physical

Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background Inactive lifestyles are becoming the norm and creative
   approaches to encourage adolescents to be more physically active are
   needed. Little is known about how gamification techniques can be used in
   physical activity interventions for young people. Such approaches may
   stimulate interest and encourage physical activity behaviour. The study
   investigated the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a physical
   activity intervention for adolescents which included gamification
   techniques within schools. We tested recruitment and retention
   strategies for schools and participants, the use of proposed outcome
   measures, and explored intervention acceptability. Methods This
   school-based feasibility study of a randomised cluster trial recruited
   adolescents aged 12-14 years (n = 224) from five schools (three
   intervention; two control) in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The 22-week
   intervention (The StepSmart Challenge) informed by self-determination
   theory and incorporating gamification strategies involved a school-based
   pedometer competition. Outcomes, measured at baseline, and
   post-intervention (at 22 weeks post-baseline and 52 weeks post-baseline)
   included daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)
   (measured using ActiGraph accelerometer), mental wellbeing
   (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale), social support for physical
   activity, time preference (for delayed and larger rewards or immediate
   and smaller rewards), pro-social behaviour (Strengths and Difficulties
   Questionnaire (SDQ)) and the influence of social networks. The
   intervention's acceptability was explored in focus groups. Results We
   invited 14 schools to participate; eight showed interest in
   participating. We recruited the first five who responded; all five
   completed the trial. Of the 236 pupils invited, 224 participated
   (94.9\%): 84.8\% (190/224) provided valid MVPA (minutes/day) at baseline
   and 57.2\% (123/215) at 52 weeks. All other outcomes were well completed
   apart from the SDQ (65\% at baseline). Qualitative data highlighted that
   participants and teachers found The StepSmart Challenge to be an
   acceptable intervention. Conclusions The level of interest and high
   recruitment and retention rates provide support for the feasibility of
   this trial. The intervention, incorporating gamification strategies and
   the recruitment methods, using parental opt-out procedures, were
   acceptable to participants and teachers. Teachers also suggested that
   the implementation of The StepSmart Challenge could be embedded in a
   lifelong learning approach to health within the school curriculum. As
   young people's lives become more intertwined with technology, the use of
   innovative gamified interventions could be one approach to engage and
   motivate health behavioural change in this population.},

Title = {Developing interventions to improve health: a systematic mapping review
   of international practice between 2015 and 2016},

Abstract = {Background Researchers publish the processes they use to develop
   interventions to improve health. Reflecting on this endeavour may help
   future developers to improve their practice. Methods Our aim was to
   collate, describe, and analyse the actions developers take when
   developing complex interventions to improve health. We carried out a
   systematic mapping review of empirical research studies that report the
   development of complex interventions to improve health. A search was
   undertaken of five databases over 2015-2016 using the term `intervention
   dev{*}'. Eighty-seven journal articles reporting the process of
   intervention development were identified. A purposive subset of 30
   articles, using a range of published approaches to developing
   interventions, was selected for in-depth analysis using principles of
   realist synthesis to identify the actions of intervention development
   and rationales underpinning those actions. Results The 87 articles were
   from the USA (39/87), the UK (32/87), continental Europe (6/87), and the
   rest of the world (10/87). These mainly took a pragmatic self-selected
   approach (n = 43); a theory- and evidence-based approach, e.g.
   Intervention Mapping, Behaviour Change Wheel (n = 22); or a partnership
   approach, e.g. community-based participatory research, co-design (n =
   10). Ten actions of intervention development were identified from the
   subset of 30 articles, including identifying a need for an intervention,
   selecting the intervention development approach to follow, considering
   the needs of the target population, reviewing published evidence,
   involving stakeholders, drawing or generating theory, and designing and
   refining the intervention. Rationales for these actions were that they
   would produce more engaging, acceptable, feasible, and effective
   interventions. Conclusions Developers take a variety of approaches to
   the international endeavour of complex intervention development. We have
   identified and described a set of actions taken within this endeavour
   regardless of whether developers follow a published approach or not.
   Future developers can use these actions and the rationales that underpin
   them to help them make decisions about the process of intervention
   development.},

Abstract = {Background Problems with oral language skills in childhood have been
   linked with poor educational, employment, and mental health outcomes. In
   the UK, there is increasing concern about the oral language skills of
   children, particularly children from areas of social disadvantage.
   Research emphasises the importance of the home language environment as a
   fundamental bedrock for the development of oral language skills. It is
   vital, therefore, that support is available to help families in need to
   provide the optimal language environment for their child. Talking
   Together is a 6-week home visiting programme recently commissioned by
   Better Start Bradford to develop parents' knowledge of the importance of
   a good language environment and help to improve parent-child
   interactions. This study represents the initial steps in developing a
   definitive trial of the Talking Together programme. Method This study is
   a two-arm randomised controlled feasibility study in which families
   referred into the Talking Together programme and consent to participate
   in the trial will be randomly allocated to either an intervention group
   or a waiting control group. We will assess the recruitment and retention
   rates, the representativeness of our sample, the appropriateness of our
   measures, and the sample size needed for a definitive trial. We will
   also carry out a qualitative evaluation to explore the acceptability of
   trial procedures for families and service providers, fidelity of
   delivery, time and resources for training, and barriers and facilitators
   to engagement with the programme. Clear progression criteria will be
   used to assess suitability for a definitive trial. Conclusion This
   feasibility study will inform the development of a definitive trial of
   this home-based visiting programme, which will add to the sparse
   evidence base on which practitioners can draw when supporting families
   in need. The lessons learnt from this feasibility study will also inform
   the wider evaluation work of the Better Start Bradford Innovation Hub.},

Title = {Rethinking Strategies for Positive Newborn Screening Result (NBS plus )
   Delivery (ReSPoND): a process evaluation of co-designing interventions
   to minimise impact on parental emotional well-being and stress},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Background Newborn blood spot (NBS) screening seeks to prevent ill
   health, disability and death through early diagnosis and effective
   intervention. Each year, around 10,000 parents of babies born in England
   are given a positive NBS result indicating their child may be affected
   or carriers of one of the nine conditions currently screened for.
   Despite guidance, these results are inconsistently delivered to parents
   across geographical regions. There is evidence that many parents are
   dissatisfied with how NBS results are communicated to them and that poor
   communication practices can lead to various negative sequelae. The
   purpose of this study is to co-design, implement and undertake a process
   evaluation of new, co-designed interventions to improve delivery of
   initial positive NBS results to parents. Methods This mixed-methods
   study will use four phases with defined outputs. Family Systems Theory
   will form the theoretical basis for the study. The principles and
   methods of experience-based co-design will underpin intervention
   development. Normalisation Process Theory will underpin the process
   evaluation of the interventions co-designed to improve the delivery of
   positive NBS results to parents. An economic analysis will determine
   resource use and costs of current practice and of implementing the new
   co-designed interventions. The nominal group technique will be used to
   inform the selection of suitable outcome measures for a future
   evaluation study. Discussion The main output of the proposed study will
   be co-designed interventions for initial communication of positive NBS
   results to parents ready to be evaluated in a definitive evaluation
   study. The interventions, co-designed with parents, will help to
   minimise potential negative sequelae associated with poor communication
   practices by considering parental and staff experiences as well as
   healthcare challenges such as finite resources. In addition, information
   about indicative costs associated with different communication
   strategies will be determined. It is anticipated it may also be possible
   to extrapolate principles of good communication practices from the
   present study for the delivery of bad news to parents for children newly
   diagnosed with other conditions including cancer and other chronic
   conditions such as diabetes or epilepsy.},

Abstract = {Background: Cancer affects millions of individuals globally, with a
   mortality rate of over eight million people annually. Although
   palliative care is often provided outside of specialist services, many
   people require, at some point in their illness journey, support from
   specialist palliative care services, for example, those provided in
   hospice settings. This transition can be a time of uncertainty and fear,
   and there is a need for effective interventions to meet the
   psychological and supportive care needs of people with cancer that
   cannot be cured. Whilst Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been
   shown to be effective across diverse health problems, robust evidence
   for its effectiveness in palliative cancer populations is not extensive.
   Method: This mixed-methods study uses a single-case experimental design
   with embedded qualitative interviews to pilot test a novel intervention
   for this patient group. Between 14 and 20 patients will be recruited
   from two hospices in England and Scotland. Participants will receive
   five face-to-face manualised sessions with a psychological therapist.
   Sessions are structured around teaching core ACT skills (openness,
   awareness and engagement) as a way to deal effectively with challenges
   of transition into specialist palliative care services. Outcome measures
   include cancer-specific quality of life (primary outcome) and distress
   (secondary outcome), which are assessed alongside measures of
   psychological flexibility. Daily diary outcome assessments will be taken
   for key measures, alongside more detailed weekly self-report, through
   baseline, intervention and 1-month follow-up phases. After follow-up,
   participants will be invited to take part in a qualitative interview to
   understand their experience of taking part and acceptability and
   perceived effectiveness of the intervention and its components.
   Discussion: This study is the first investigation of using ACT with
   terminally ill patients at the beginning of their transition into
   palliative treatment. Using in-depth single-case approaches, we will
   refine and manualise intervention content by the close of the study for
   use in follow-up research trials. Our long-term goal is then to test the
   intervention as delivered by non-psychologist specialist palliative care
   practitioners thus broadening the potential relevance of the approach.},

Title = {Exercise for advanced prostate cancer: a multicomponent, feasibility,
   trial protocol for men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate
   cancer (EXACT)},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},

Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Background: Men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer can
   experience an array of treatment-related side effects. Accumulating
   evidence suggests exercise may alleviate some of these adversities and
   assist in disease management. However, empirical evidence in advanced
   prostate cancer patients remains limited. The purpose of this study is
   to determine whether men with metastatic prostate cancer, who are
   ineligible for high-intensity exercise, can partake in a home-based,
   moderate-intensity exercise program and the impact of doing so on
   quality of life and physical fitness parameters.
   Methods: Thirty men with adenocarcinoma of the prostate and progressive
   systemic, metastatic disease will be recruited. Clinicians will screen
   patients against inclusion criteria to determine eligibility. All men
   enrolled will be prescribed a tailored, home-based, moderate-intensity
   exercise intervention consisting of aerobic and strengthening components
   for 12 weeks. Patients will receive supplementary education materials
   and weekly behavioural change consultations throughout the intervention.
   The primary outcome will be the feasibility of delivering such an
   intervention in men with metastatic disease. Secondary endpoints
   including skeletal events will be monitored for safety, as will the
   feasibility of patient-reported outcome measures and the sampling time
   points, generating data pertaining to completion rates and potential
   effect in future trials. General physical fitness will be assessed
   during these visits, using timed sit-to-stand testing and a 6-min
   walking test. Prior to each visit, objective physical activity levels
   will be captured for 7 days using an accelerometer, to determine the
   feasibility of this technology and the quality of data obtained. In
   parallel with the feasibility aspects of the trial, changes compared to
   baseline will be reported. Direct regular contact will also serve as a
   feedback loop, should any issues arise. This study has received ethical
   approval from the Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern
   Ireland.
   Conclusions: This study aims to determine the potential utility of a
   home-based exercise intervention in managing side effects associated
   with advanced prostate cancer and its treatment. This feasibility trial
   will inform the design and implementation of a larger randomised control
   trial to determine the efficacy of moderate aerobic and strengthening
   exercise as an adjuvant therapy in men with metastatic prostate cancer.
   Collecting such evidence provides further support for exercise in this
   paradigm and potential for its inclusion as a low-toxicity therapy in
   standard cancer care, in the longer term.},

Title = {A classroom-based intervention targeting working memory, attention and

   randomised feasibility trial},

Abstract = {Background There is international recognition of the need for creative,
   classroom-based interventions to support children at risk of low
   academic achievement and well-being, due to poor attention and language
   skills on school entry. Working memory (WM) is a cognitive skill that is
   strongly associated with attention and language skills. There has been
   speculation that WM training, embedded within typical educational
   activities, may improve children's WM skills and produce transfer
   effects to real-world skills such as attention and language. However,
   little is known about the effectiveness of this approach. `Recall to
   Enhance Children's Attention, Language and Learning' (RECALL) is a
   novel, 6-week, classroom-based intervention targeting WM, attention and
   language skills in 4-5 year olds. RECALL was co-produced with health
   professionals, teachers and parents. This protocol describes the
   rationale, methods and analysis plan for a proposed cluster randomised
   feasibility trial of this RECALL programme. Methods This is a three-arm,
   cluster randomised feasibility trial comparing RECALL to an existing
   programme (active control), and no-intervention (education as usual). We
   will recruit six schools in socially disadvantaged areas in one region
   of the UK. Two schools will be randomly allocated to each arm of the
   trial. In each school, one class of children (ages 4-5 years) of approx.
   30 children will be involved in this study. Ten children in each class
   will be sampled purposefully for outcome measurement including:
   standardised assessments of WM, language and attention skills; teacher
   ratings of attention; and parent ratings of functional communication
   skills. These will be administered at baseline and 1-week
   post-intervention in order to test the acceptability of the measures. A
   process evaluation using semi-structured interviews with participants
   will explore the acceptability of RECALL and the procedures employed in
   this trial. Discussion This feasibility study will explore the
   acceptability of RECALL to the health professionals and teachers who
   will deliver it and inform the optimal design of the programme. The
   inclusion of an active control group and the blinding of outcomes
   assessors enhance rigour in this study. The findings will determine
   whether this study can be scaled-up into a definitive cluster randomised
   trial to evaluate the effectiveness of RECALL.},

Abstract = {Background Pancreatic cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of
   any malignancy, placing a substantial burden on patients and families
   with high unmet informational and supportive care needs. Nevertheless,
   access to psychosocial and palliative care services for the individuals
   affected is limited. There is a need for standardized approaches to
   facilitate adjustment and to improve knowledge about the disease and its
   anticipated impact. In this intervention-development paper guided by
   implementation science principles, we report the rationale, methods, and
   processes employed in developing an interdisciplinary group
   psychoeducational intervention for people affected by pancreatic cancer.
   The acceptability and feasibility of implementation will be evaluated as
   a part of a subsequent feasibility study. Methods The Schofield and
   Chambers framework for designing sustainable self-management
   interventions in cancer care informed the development of the
   intervention content and format. The Consolidated Framework for
   Implementation Research served as an overarching guide of the
   implementation process, including the development phase and the
   formative evaluation plan of implementation. Results A representative
   team of stakeholders collaboratively developed and tailored the
   intervention content and format with attention to the principles of
   implementation science, including available resourcing. The final
   intervention prototype was designed as a single group-session led by an
   interdisciplinary clinical team with expertise in caring for patients
   with pancreatic cancer and their families and in addressing nutrition
   guidelines, disease and symptom management, communication with family
   and health care providers, family impact of cancer, preparing for the
   future, and palliative and supportive care services. Conclusions The
   present paper describes the development of a group psychoeducational
   intervention to address the informational and supportive care needs of
   people affected by pancreatic cancer. Consideration of implementation
   science during intervention development efforts can optimize uptake and
   sustainability in the clinical setting. Our approach may be utilized as
   a framework for the design and implementation of similar initiatives to
   support people affected by diseases with limited prognoses.},

Abstract = {Background Physical activity (PA) is positively associated with quality
   of life. People with a stoma are less likely to engage in PA than those
   without a stoma. Methods In this feasibility intervention study, we will
   perform the following: (1) Develop a PA intervention for people with a
   stoma. An Expert Working Group of behavioural scientists, exercise
   scientists, clinicians and a Patient Advisory Group of people with a
   bowel stoma will meet with the research team to inform the development
   of a PA intervention for people with a stoma. A manual of the
   intervention will be the main output. (2) Explore PA instructors'
   experiences of delivering the PA intervention. PA instructors will
   record on paper the number of PA consultations with each patient and a
   researcher will interview the PA instructors about their experiences of
   delivering the intervention. (3) Assess the level of patient (bowel
   cancer or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with a stoma between
   6 weeks and 24 months post-surgery) engagement with the PA intervention
   and their views on intervention acceptability and usefulness. Patients
   will keep a PA diary to record daily pedometer recorded step count and
   type and duration of activities. A researcher will interview patients
   about their experiences of the PA intervention. (4) Assess screening,
   eligibility, consent, data completion, loss to follow up, and missing
   data rates, representativeness of participants and potential treatment
   effects. A researcher will record on paper all study procedure
   parameters. Quality of life (stoma-quality of life; Functional
   Assessment of Cancer Therapy, Short IBD questionnaire), fatigue (FACIT
   fatigue scale) and PA (accelerometer) will be measured pre- and
   post-intervention in patients. For IBD patients only, blood will be
   taken to measure systemic inflammation. Discussion We hypothesise that a
   PA intervention will be an effective means of improving the quality of
   life of people with a stoma. Before embarking on a full randomised
   controlled trial to test this hypothesis, a PA intervention needs to be
   developed and a feasibility study of the proposed PA intervention
   conducted.},

Abstract = {Background A number of children experience difficulties with social
   communication and this has long-term deleterious effects on their mental
   health, social development and education. The proposal presented in this
   article describes a feasibility study for a trial to test an
   intervention ('E-PLAYS') aimed at supporting children with social
   communication impairments. E-PLAYS harnesses technology in the form of a
   novel computer game in order to develop collaborative and communication
   skills. Preliminary studies by the authors show that when E-PLAYS was
   administered by the research team, children with social communication
   impairments showed improvements on communication test scores and on
   observed collaborative behaviours. The study described here is a
   pragmatic trial to test the application of E-PLAYS delivered by NHS
   speech and language therapists together with schools. Methods This
   protocol outlines a two-arm feasibility cluster-randomised controlled
   trial of the E-PLAYS intervention with treatment as usual control arm,
   with randomisation at the level of the speech and language therapist.
   The aim of this study is to ascertain whether it will be feasible to
   progress to running a full-scale definitive trial to test the
   effectiveness of E-PLAYS in an NHS setting. Data relating to recruitment
   and retention, the appropriateness of outcomes and the acceptability of
   E-PLAYS to participants will be collected. Speech and language
   therapists will select suitable children (ages 4-7 years old) from their
   caseloads and deliver either the E-PLAYS intervention (experimental
   group) or treatment as usual (control group). Assessments will include
   blinded language measures and observations, non-blinded teacher-reported
   measures of peer relations and classroom behaviour and parent-reported
   use of resources and quality of life. There will also be a qualitative
   process evaluation. Discussion The findings of this study will inform
   the decision as to whether to progress to a full-scale definitive
   randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness of E-PLAYS when
   delivered by speech and language therapists and teaching assistants
   within schools. The use of technology in game form is a novel approach
   in an area where there are currently few available interventions.},

Abstract = {Background Fun For Wellness (FFW) is an online behavioral intervention
   designed to promote growth in well-being and physical activity by
   providing capability-enhancing learning opportunities to participants.
   The conceptual framework for the FFW intervention is guided by
   self-efficacy theory. Evidence has been provided for the efficacy of FFW
   to promote self-reported free-living physical well-being actions in
   adults who comply with the intervention. The objective of this
   manuscript is to describe the protocol for a feasibility study designed
   to address uncertainties regarding the inclusion of accelerometer-based
   assessment of free-living physical activity within the FFW online
   intervention among adults with obesity in the United States of America
   (USA). Method The study design is a prospective, double-blind, parallel
   group randomized pilot trial. Thirty participants will be randomly
   assigned to the FFW or usual care (UC) group to achieve a 1:1 group
   (i.e., FFW:UC) assignment. Recruitment of participants is scheduled to
   begin on 29 April 2019 at a local bariatric services center within a
   major healthcare organization in the Midwest of the USA. There are five
   eligibility criteria for participation in this study: (1) between 18 and
   64 years old, (2) a body mass index >= 25.00 kg/m(2), (3) ability to
   access the online intervention, (4) the absence of simultaneous
   enrollment in another intervention program promoting physical activity,
   and (5) willingness to comply with instructions for physical activity
   monitoring. Eligibility verification and data collection will be
   conducted online. Three waves of data will be collected over a 13-week
   period. Instruments designed to measure demographic information,
   anthropometric characteristics, acceptability and feasibility of
   accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity, self-efficacy, and
   well-being will be included in the study. Data will be analyzed using
   descriptive statistics (e.g., recruitment rates), Pearson's correlation
   coefficient, Bland-Altman analyses, and inferential statistical models
   under both an intent to treat approach and a complier average causal
   effect approach. Discussion Results are intended to inform the
   preparation of a future definitive randomized controlled trial. Trial

Abstract = {Background: While people who are homeless often experience poor mental
   and physical health and problem substance use, getting access to
   appropriate services can be challenging. The development of trusting
   relationships with non-judgemental staff can facilitate initial and
   sustained engagement with health and wider support services.
   Peer-delivered approaches seem to have particular promise, but there is
   limited evidence regarding peer interventions that are both acceptable
   to, and effective for, people who are homeless and using drugs and/or
   alcohol. In the proposed study, we will develop and test the use of a
   peer-to-peer relational intervention with people experiencing
   homelessness. Drawing on the concept of psychologically informed
   environments, it will focus on building trusting and supportive
   relationships and providing practical elements of support such as access
   to primary care, treatment and housing options.
   Methods: A mixed-method feasibility study with concurrent process
   evaluation will be conducted to explore the feasibility and
   acceptability of a peer-delivered, relational intervention for people
   with problem substance use who are homeless. Peer Navigators will be
   based in homelessness outreach and residential services in Scotland and
   England. Peer Navigators will work with a small number of participants
   for up to 12 months providing both practical and emotional support. The
   sample size for the intervention is 60. Those receiving the intervention
   must be currently homeless or at risk of homelessness, over the age of
   18 years and self-report alcohol/drug problems. A holistic health check
   will be conducted in the first few months of the intervention and
   repeated towards the end. Health checks will be conducted by a
   researcher in the service where the Peer Navigator is based.
   Semi-structured qualitative interviews with intervention participants
   and staff in both intervention and standard care settings, and all Peer
   Navigators, will be conducted to explore their experiences with the
   intervention. Non-participant observation will be conducted in
   intervention and standard care sites to document similarities and
   differences between care pathways.
   Discussion: The SHARPS study will provide evidence regarding whether a
   peer-delivered harm reduction intervention is feasible and acceptable to
   people experiencing homelessness and problem substance use in order to
   develop a definitive trial.},

Abstract = {Background: Alcohol-related harm is currently estimated to cost the
   National Health Service (NHS) in England 3.5 pound bn a year. Of the
   estimated 1.6 million people with some degree of alcohol dependence,
   some 600,000 are believed to be moderately or severely dependent and may
   benefit from intensive treatment. Outcomes from medically assisted
   withdrawal, also referred to as detoxification, are often poor, with
   poor engagement in relapse prevention interventions and subsequent high
   relapse rates. Detoxification is costly both financially and to the
   individual. It has been found that people who experience multiple
   detoxifications show more emotional and cognitive impairments. These
   changes may confer upon them the inability to resolve conflict and
   increased sensitivity to stress thus contributing to increased
   vulnerability risk of relapse. The study aims to test the feasibility of
   using a group intervention aiming to prepare participants for long-term
   abstinence before, rather than after, they have medically assisted
   detoxification. The current study will establish key parameters that
   influence trial design such as recruitment, compliance with the
   intervention, retention, and sensitivity of alternative outcome
   measures, in preparation for a future randomised controlled trial (RCT).
   This paper presents the protocol of the feasibility study.
   Methods: The study corresponds to phase 2 of the Medical Research
   Council (MRC) complex interventions guidelines which cover the
   development and feasibility testing of an intervention. The work is in
   three stages. The development, adaptation and implementation of the
   Structured Preparation before Alcohol Detoxification (SPADe)
   intervention (stage 1), a randomised feasibility study with economic
   evaluation (stage 2) and a qualitative study (stage 3). Fifty
   participants will be recruited from two community alcohol treatment
   services in England. Participants will be randomised in two arms: the
   treatment as usual arm (TAU), which includes planned medically assisted
   detoxification and aftercare and the intervention arm in which
   participants will receive structured group preparation before
   detoxification in addition to TAU. The main outcomes are duration of
   continuous abstinence with no incidents of lapse or relapse, percentage
   of days abstinent and time to relapse.
   Discussion: The socioeconomic harms associated with alcohol have been
   well-documented, yet existing treatment options have not been able to
   reduce high relapse rates. This study will build on existing
   naturalistic studies underpinned by psychological interventions offered
   early and before detoxification from alcohol, which aim to reverse
   automatised habitual behaviours and thus may help us to understand how
   better to support people to remain abstinent and improve post
   detoxification outcomes.},

Abstract = {Background Families applying for asylum have often experienced multiple
   potentially traumatic events and continue to face stressors during their
   resettlement. Studies have indicated that traumatic events can
   negatively impact parenting behaviour and child development. A secondary
   preventive multi-family intervention programme, called Family
   Empowerment, was developed. Family Empowerment aims to strengthen
   parenting skills and prevent exacerbation of emotional problems in
   asylum-seeker families. This study protocol aims to evaluate the
   feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of Family
   Empowerment to reduce parental mental health problems and improve family
   functioning. Methods An uncontrolled pre-test-post-test design will be
   conducted, using a mixed-methods approach. Approximately 60 families
   living at asylum centres and family locations with children aged 0-18
   will be included. All participants will be invited to take part in seven
   sessions of Family Empowerment. Measurements take place at baseline,
   during implementation of Family Empowerment and 1 week post-Family
   Empowerment. Demographic data, the quality of the parent-child
   interaction, family functioning, parental symptoms of depression and
   anxiety, and participants' feedback on progress and the therapeutic
   alliance will be assessed. A programme integrity list will be filled out
   during each session. Semi-structured interviews at baseline and
   post-Family Empowerment will be used to evaluate Family Empowerment.
   Discussion This is the first study to provide a pilot implementation and
   evaluation of Family Empowerment. The current study will inform us on
   how to improve programme elements and the implementation of Family
   Empowerment. Limitations are discussed.},

Title = {A web-based carepartner-integrated rehabilitation program for persons
   with stroke: study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Background Family carepartner management and support can improve stroke
   survivor recovery, yet research has placed little emphasis on how to
   integrate families into the rehabilitation process without increasing
   negative carepartner outcomes. Our group has developed creative
   approaches for engaging family carepartners in rehabilitation activities
   to improve physical and psychosocial health for both the carepartner and
   stroke survivor. The purpose of this study is to explore a novel,
   web-based intervention (Carepartner and Constraint-Induced Therapy;
   CARE-CITE) designed to facilitate positive carepartner involvement
   during a home-based application of constraint-induced movement therapy
   (CIMT) for the upper extremity. Methods The primary aim of the study is
   to determine feasibility of CARE-CITE for both stroke survivors and
   their carepartners. Carepartner mental health, family conflict
   surrounding stroke recovery, and stroke survivor upper extremity
   function will be evaluated using an evaluator blinded, two-group
   experimental design (blocked randomization protocol according to a 2:1
   randomization schema) with 32 intervention dyads and 16 control dyads
   (who will receive CIMT without structured carepartner involvement).
   CARE-CITE consists of online education modules for the carepartner to
   review in parallel to the 30-h CIMT that the stroke survivor receives.
   The intent of CARE-CITE is to enhance the home-based intervention of
   CIMT, by helping the carepartner support the therapy and create a
   therapeutic home environment encouraging practice of the weaker arm in
   functional tasks. Discussion The CARE-CITE study is testing the
   feasibility of a family-integrated rehabilitation approach applied in
   the home environment, and results will provide the foundation for larger
   clinical studies. The overall significance of this research plan is to
   increase the understanding and further development of interventions that
   may serve as models to promote family involvement in the rehabilitation
   process.},

Abstract = {Introduction Active play is a novel approach to addressing low physical
   activity levels and fundamental movement skills (FMS) in childhood and
   new interventions must be developed and evaluated. Aim This study aimed
   to determine the feasibility of a 10-week school-based `active play'
   intervention, and present preliminary findings on four outcomes:
   physical activity levels, FMS, inhibition, and maths fluency. Methods
   This was a feasibility cluster RCT in which eight schools (one primary
   three class per school) were paired and randomly allocated to either the
   10-week intervention (n = 4) or waiting-list control (n = 4). The active
   play intervention consisted of a 1-h outdoor physical activity session
   per week, incorporating 30 min of facilitated games and 30 min of free
   play. Feasibility measures were gathered using appropriate methods and
   physical activity was measured using an ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer,
   FMS were assessed using the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 (TGMD-2),
   inhibition was measured using a Flanker Test and maths fluency was
   assessed using the One Minute Basic Number Facts Test. Results Sixty-six
   percent of eligible children (n = 137) agreed to participate in the
   research. No schools withdrew from the study and three participants were
   lost to follow-up. Compliance to the intervention was high-none of the
   participants missed more than two of the ten scheduled active play
   sessions. Data lost to follow-up were minimal; most were lost (14\%) for
   school day physical activity. Active play sessions were shorter than
   planned on average by 10 min, and participants spent a mean of 39.4\%
   (14.2) of the session time in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical
   activity (MVPA). There was preliminary evidence of a small intervention
   effect on MVPA (d = 0.3), FMS score (d = 0.4), inhibition (fish trial: d
   = 0.1, arrow trial d = 0.1) and maths fluency (addition: d = 0.3,
   subtraction: d = 0.1). Conclusion The active play intervention was
   feasible and benefitted from a relatively high MVPA content; however,
   preliminary findings suggest the intervention had a small effect on the
   outcomes. Having more active play sessions per week and/or extending the
   duration of the intervention may increase the effects and these should
   be tested before a future definitive cluster RCT is undertaken.},

Abstract = {Background Current international consensus is that `early' referral to
   palliative care services improves cancer patient and family carer
   outcomes; however, in practice, these referrals are not routine.
   Uncertainty about the `best time' to refer has been highlighted as
   contributing to care variation. Previous work has identified clear
   disease-specific transition points in the cancer illness which heralded
   subsequent poor prognosis (less than 6 months) and which, we contest,
   represent times when palliative care should be routinely introduced as a
   standardised approach, if not already in place, to maximise patient and
   carer benefit. This protocol details a trial that will test the
   feasibility of a novel standardised outpatient model of early palliative
   care {[}Standardised Early Palliative Care (STEP Care)] for advanced
   cancer patients and their family carers, with referrals occurring at the
   defined disease-specific evidence-based transition points. The aims of
   this study are to (1) determine the feasibility of conducting a
   definitive phase 3 randomised trial, which evaluates effectiveness of
   STEP Care (compared to usual best practice cancer care) for patients
   with advanced breast or prostate cancer or high grade glioma; (2)
   examine preliminary efficacy of STEP Care on patient/family caregiver
   outcomes, including quality of life, mood, symptoms, illness
   understanding and overall survival; (3) document the impact of STEP Care
   on quality of end-of-life care; and (4) evaluate the timing of
   palliative care introduction according to patients, families and health
   care professionals. Methods Phase 2, multicenter, open-label,
   parallel-arm, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of STEP Care plus
   standard best practice cancer care versus standard best practice cancer
   care alone. Discussion The research will test the feasibility of
   standardised palliative care introduction based on illness transitions
   and provide guidance on subsequent development of phase 3 studies of
   integration. This will directly address the current uncertainty about
   palliative care timing.},

Abstract = {Background Interventions need to be developed prior to the feasibility
   and piloting phase of a study. There are a variety of published
   approaches to developing interventions, programmes or innovations to
   improve health. Identifying different types of approach, and
   synthesising the range of actions taken within this endeavour, can
   inform future intervention development. Methods This study is a
   systematic methods overview of approaches to intervention development.
   Approaches were considered for inclusion if they described how to
   develop or adapt an intervention in a book, website or journal article
   published after 2007, or were cited in a primary research study
   reporting the development of a specific intervention published in 2015
   or 2016. Approaches were read, a taxonomy of approaches was developed
   and the range of actions taken across different approaches were
   synthesised. Results Eight categories of approach to intervention
   development were identified. (1) Partnership, where people who will use
   the intervention participate equally with the research team in
   decision-making about the intervention throughout the development
   process. (2) Target population-centred, where the intervention is based
   on the views and actions of the people who will use it. (3) Evidence and
   theory-based, where the intervention is based on published research
   evidence and existing theories. (4) Implementation-based, where the
   intervention is developed with attention to ensuring it will be used in
   the real world. (5) Efficiency-based, where components of an
   intervention are tested using experimental designs to select components
   which will optimise efficiency. (6) Stepped or phased, where
   interventions are developed with an emphasis on following a systematic
   set of processes. (7) Intervention-specific, where an approach is
   constructed for a specific type of intervention. (8) Combination, where
   existing approaches to intervention development are formally combined.
   The actions from approaches in all eight categories were synthesised to
   identify 18 actions to consider when developing interventions.
   Conclusions This overview of approaches to intervention development can
   help researchers to understand the variety of existing approaches, and
   to understand the range of possible actions involved in intervention
   development, prior to assessing feasibility or piloting the
   intervention. Findings from this overview will contribute to future
   guidance on intervention development.},

Abstract = {Background There is a need for high-quality research aiming to increase
   physical activity in families. This study assessed the feasibility and
   acceptability of FRESH (Families Reporting Every Step to Health), a
   child-led family-based physical activity intervention delivered online.
   Methods In a two-armed randomised feasibility study, 12 families (with
   an 8-10-year-old index child) were allocated to a `child-only' (CO) or
   `family' arm (FAM) of the theory-based FRESH intervention. Both received
   access to the FRESH website, allowing participants to select step
   challenges to `travel' to target cities around the world, log their
   steps, and track their progress as they virtually globetrot. Only index
   children wore pedometers in CO; in FAM, all family members wore
   pedometers and worked towards collective goals. All family members were
   eligible to participate in the evaluation. Mixed-methods process
   evaluation (questionnaires and family focus groups) at 6-week follow-up
   consisted of completing questionnaires assessing acceptability of the
   intervention and accompanying effectiveness evaluation, focussed on
   physical (e.g. fitness, blood pressure), psychosocial (e.g. social
   support), and behavioural (e.g. objectively-measured family physical
   activity) measures. Results All families were retained (32
   participants). Parents enjoyed FRESH and all children found it fun. More
   FAM children wanted to continue with FRESH, found the website easy to
   use, and enjoyed wearing pedometers. FAM children also found it easier
   to reach goals. Most CO families would have preferred whole family
   participation. Compared to CO, FAM exhibited greater website engagement
   as they travelled to more cities (36 +/- 11 vs. 13 +/- 8) and failed
   fewer challenges (1.5 +/- 1 vs. 3 +/- 1). Focus groups also revealed
   that most families wanted elements of competition. All children enjoyed
   being part of the evaluation, and adults disagreed that there were too
   many intervention measures (overall, 2.4 +/- 1.3) or that data
   collection took too long (overall, 2.2 +/- 1.1). Conclusion FRESH was
   feasible and acceptable to participating families; however, findings
   favoured the FAM group. Recruitment, intervention fidelity and delivery
   and some measurement procedures are particular areas that require
   further attention for optimisation. Testing the preliminary
   effectiveness of FRESH on family physical activity is a necessary next
   step.},

Title = {Definition and improvement of the concept and tools of a psychosocial

Abstract = {Background Studies have shown that supporting parents in pediatric
   oncology reduces family distress following a cancer diagnosis.
   Manualized programs for parents have therefore been developed to reduce
   family distress. However, these programs have limitations that need to
   be improved, such as better defining programs' procedures, developing
   interventions focusing on parents' conjugal relationship, conducting
   rigorous evaluations of implementation, and proposing adaptations to
   various cultural dimensions. According to the Obesity-Related Behavioral
   Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model for the development of behavioral
   intervention, we improved these limitations and developed TAKING BACK
   CONTROL TOGETHER, a six in-person intervention sessions to support
   parents of children with cancer by taking the active components of two
   programs: Bright IDEAS and SCCIP. Referring to the redesign phase of the
   ORBIT model, this study aims to refine the definition of this program's
   design by interviewing parents and healthcare professionals. Methods In
   order to refine the program, we used a sequential mixed-methods study.
   Parents and healthcare professionals first completed questionnaires
   assessing the program, and then discussed its limitations, benefits, and
   areas for improvement in group and/or individual interviews. We
   performed a descriptive thematic content analysis of the qualitative
   data from the open-ended questions (questionnaires and interviews) with
   NVivo 11 to categorize recommendations for the program refinement.
   Results The results showed that components seemed pertinent to final
   users. The main areas needing improvement were the level of complexity
   and understandability of the parent manual, the possibility to choose
   the place and time of the intervention, and the lack of ethnic/cultural
   diversity. Changes to the program were made accordingly. Conclusions It
   is necessary to include end-users when developing complex intervention
   programs designed for vulnerable populations and sensitive clinical
   contexts. Following the present refinement, we now have a treatment
   package, which is safe and acceptable for the target population and has
   a better chance of yielding a clinically significant benefit for users
   in a future pilot study.},

Abstract = {Background Psychoeducation is included in the Norwegian national
   guidelines for treatment of adult ADHD. Despite some promising results
   for the treatment of other conditions and ADHD, little is known about
   the efficacy of such interventions. This paper presents a protocol for a
   pilot randomized controlled trial featuring a psychoeducational group
   program for patients with ADHD. The main objective of this pilot trial
   is to investigate adherence, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a
   ten-session psychoeducational group designed to address specific
   challenges faced by adults diagnosed with ADHD. Methods This pilot study
   will evaluate patient satisfaction and preliminary efficacy of a
   psychoeducational group treatment using a randomized waitlist-controlled
   trial at two different outpatient clinics in mid-Norway. All
   participants will receive treatment as usual, concomitant with the
   intervention and waitlist period. Client satisfaction (CSQ 8), general
   self-efficacy (GSE-6), ADHD-related quality of life (AAQoL), symptoms of
   ADHD (SCL-9; ASRS), and work participation will be assessed at the time
   of recruitment prior to randomization (T0), pre-intervention (T1),
   post-intervention (T2), and at 10 weeks follow-up (T3). Recruitment and
   dropout rates along with treatment adherence will also be evaluated.
   Discussion This study offers valuable insight into the preliminary
   efficacy of educational programs implemented in outpatient clinics. The
   aim of the trial is to evaluate adherence, feasibility, patient
   satisfaction, and the preliminary efficacy of a psychoeducational group
   intervention for patients with adult ADHD and provide further insight
   into the design and construction of a large-scale trial. The results
   also offer preliminary empirical evidence to inform the development of
   larger and more complex studies.},

Abstract = {Background: Dating and relationship violence (DRV)-intimate partner
   violence during adolescence-encompasses physical, sexual and emotional
   abuse. DRV is associated with a range of adverse health outcomes
   including injuries, sexually transmitted infections, adolescent
   pregnancy and mental health issues. Experiencing DRV also predicts both
   victimisation and perpetration of partner violence in adulthood.
   Prevention targeting early adolescence is important because this is when
   dating behaviours begin, behavioural norms become established and DRV
   starts to manifest. Despite high rates of DRV victimisation in England,
   from 22 to 48\% among girls and 12 to 27\% among boys ages 14-17 who
   report intimate relationships, no RCTs of DRV prevention programmes have
   taken place in the UK. Informed by two school-based interventions that
   have shown promising results in RCTs in the USA-Safe Dates and Shifting
   Boundaries-Project Respect aims to optimise and pilot a DRV prevention
   programme for secondary schools in England.
   Methods: Design: optimisation and pilot cluster RCT. Trial will include
   a process evaluation and assess the feasibility of conducting a phase
   III RCT with embedded economic evaluation. Cognitive interviewing will
   inform survey development. Participants: optimisation involves four
   schools and pilot RCT involves six (four intervention, two control). All
   are secondary schools in England. Baseline surveys conducted with
   students in years 8 and 9 (ages 12-14). Follow-up surveys conducted with
   the same cohort, 16 months post-baseline. Optimisation sessions to
   inform intervention and research methods will involve consultations with
   stakeholders, including young people. Intervention: school staff
   training, including guidance on reviewing school policies and addressing
   `hotspots' for DRV and gender-based harassment; information for parents;
   informing students of a help-seeking app; and a classroom curriculum for
   students in years 9 and 10, including a student-led campaign. Primary
   outcome: the primary outcome of the pilot RCT will be whether
   progression to a phase III RCT is justified. Testing within the pilot
   will also determine which of two existing scales is optimal for
   assessing DRV victimisation and perpetration in a phase III RCT.
   Discussion: This will be the first RCT of an intervention to prevent DRV
   in the UK. If findings indicate feasibility and acceptability, we will
   undertake planning for a phase III RCT of effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Background: People with serious mental illness (SMI) have poorer
   physical health and reduced lifespans compared to the general
   population. Reasons for this are complex, but one important area is the
   identification and treatment of physical health conditions. In England,
   services are structured into primary and secondary care; physical and
   mental secondary health services are separate. This often leads to a
   lack of co-ordination of care, with people missing the screening and
   treatment they need. People with SMI may find accessing physical health
   services more difficult due to the impact of their symptoms and/or a
   lack of social support. When they do access physical care, there may be
   `diagnostic overshadowing' where physical health concerns are put down
   to a mental health diagnosis. Creating tools to support people with SMI
   to assume more control of their physical health may help to ameliorate
   some of these problems. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of
   a service user-held Physical health plan (PHP) for secondary mental
   health service users to determine whether its use increases uptake of
   physical health services.
   Methods: We will undertake a pilot quality improvement (QI) study to
   test the use of the PHP. The development of the PHP is described. A
   Theory of Change (ToC) has been developed which we will test to
   understand how the PHP is used, using focus groups at the beginning of
   the study. We will then pilot the use of the PHP for 6 months in two
   community mental health teams to find out how people use it, what
   actions are taken, and if it increases uptake of physical health care.
   We will use the RE-AIM implementation framework to guide the evaluation.
   After the pilot, we will undertake interviews with service users and
   clinical staff to elicit their views on using the PHP.
   Discussion: This study uses QI methodology and an implementation
   framework to test a novel intervention for people with SMI. If
   successful, the intervention will support people with SMI to access
   physical health services. The study will inform the design of a
   larger-scale definitive RCT.},
