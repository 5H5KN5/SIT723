	abstract = {Developing effective digital interventions to change health behavior has been a challenging goal for academics and industry players alike. Guiding intervention design using the best combination of approaches available is necessary if effective technologies are to be developed. Behavioral theory, design thinking, user-centered design, rigorous evaluation, and dissemination each have widely acknowledged merits in their application to digital health interventions. This paper introduces {IDEAS}, a step-by-step process for integrating these approaches to guide the development and evaluation of more effective digital interventions. {IDEAS} is comprised of 10 phases (empathize, specify, ground, ideate, prototype, gather, build, pilot, evaluate, and share), grouped into 4 overarching stages: Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share ({IDEAS}). Each of these phases is described and a summary of theory-based behavioral strategies that may inform intervention design is provided. The {IDEAS} framework strives to provide sufficient detail without being overly prescriptive so that it may be useful and readily applied by both investigators and industry partners in the development of their own {mHealth}, {eHealth}, and other digital health behavior change interventions.},

In search of a solution to this dilemma, computational techniques are beginning to support human researchers in synthesizing large bodies of literature. However, actionable methodological guidance on how to design, conduct, and document such computationally augmented literature reviews is lacking to date. We respond by introducing and defining computational literature reviews ({CLRs}) as a new review method and put forward a six-step roadmap, covering the {CLR} process from identifying the review objectives to selecting algorithms and reporting findings. We make the {CLR} method accessible to novice and expert users alike by identifying critical design decisions and typical challenges for each step and provide practical guidelines for tailoring the {CLR} method to four conceptual review goals. As such, we present {CLRs} as a literature review method where the choice, design, and implementation of a {CLR} are guided by specific review objectives, methodological capabilities, and resource constraints of the human researcher.},

This paper presents a computational literature review of the field from 1974 to 2017. A {CLR} automates the analysis of research articles with analysis of content (topic modelling of abstracts) to identify emergent themes in the literature. We performed a broad review of the field by initially searching using the term “System Dynamics” with more than 8000 articles. However, the results obtained were not satisfactory so we decided to restrict our sample to less than 800 articles from recognised journals and proceedings. After evaluation of the results obtained from topic modelling, we decided to use 51 topics covering most of the articles in our sample. A list of 51 topics provides enough granularity to identify relevant patterns of activity within the community of System Dynamics scholars. For each of these 51 topics, we present a commentary on the key insights obtained.},

To meet these needs, a text-mining-based computational literature review ({CLR}) of the journal of Applied Research in Quality of Life ({ARQOL}) was conducted using a machine learning process, latent Dirichlet allocation ({LDA}), in combination with selection criteria for the decision on the number of topics. The outcome provides the reader with a list of the twelve most heavily discussed topics: 1) consumption \& materialism, 2) character strength, 3) spirituality, religiousness \& personal beliefs, 4) inequality, 5) leisure \& tourism, 6) health related {QoL} ({HRQoL}) I, 7) quality of working life ({QWL}), 8) childhood \& adolescence, 9) disparity \& development, 10) disorder, 11) community issues, and 12) health related {QoL} ({HRQoL}) {II}.

We present the evolution of research pre and post {AI} spring, emerging topics as well as saturated areas. The ﬁndings show that the previously disjointed topic network structure is fully connected by early 2010s and the upward trend in management research starts in the period of 2014–2015.

	abstract = {Digital technologies are changing how and where we live, work and socialize. Rural areas are distinctive spaces and places but in the current debates of new digital phenomena, digital spaces and practices risk not being contextualized with sensitivities to rural geographies. This study aims to map how digital has been examined to date in rural-focused studies, and accordingly present propositions for how rural-digital studies can be sensitive to the distinctive and diverse character of rural spaces and places. We conduct a two-stage/scale literature re­ view, combining 1) computational topic modelling from a Global Dataset (459 article abstracts) with 2) quali­ tative content analysis from a sub-dataset focusing on the Nordic region (Nordic Sub-Dataset, 17 full articles). We begin with a topic modelling analysis generating ten major themes (topics) leading to an overview of how research areas are connected to the meaning of rural context. Turning to the Nordic region, as an in-depth example, we illustrate the complexity of rural digital geographies, through a qualitative content analysis. This demonstrates that digital in rural contexts are primarily positioned outwardly as social/regional development and business/economy, and less situated inwardly through individual experience and community building. Combined we show a wide spectrum of rural-digital relations but demonstrate that rural contexts in rural-digital relations need more attention. We propose three propositions to invite deeper rural contextualizations in future digital studies to uphold the importance of rural spaces and places through, by and with digital geography.},

Thus, a review was performed on two online databases (Scopus and {ISI} Web of Science) from 2012 to 2019. A total of 9649 studies were identified, which were analyzed using probabilistic topic modeling procedures within a machine learning approach. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation method, chosen for modeling, required the following stages: 1) data cleansing, and 2) data modeling into topics for coherence and perplexity analysis. All research was conducted according to the standards of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses in a fully computerized way. The computational literature review is an integral part of a broader literature review process. The results presented met three criteria: (1) literature review for a research area, (2) analysis and classification of journals, and (3) analysis and classification of academic and individual research teams. The contribution of the article is to demonstrate how the publication network is formed in this particular field of research, and how the content of abstracts can be automatically analyzed to provide a set of research topics for quick understanding and application in future projects.},

Topic models also offer an interpretable representation of documents used in several downstream Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) tasks. Modeling techniques vary from probabilistic graphical models to the more recent neural models. This paper surveys topic models from four aspects. The first aspect categorizes different topic modeling techniques into four categories: algebraic, fuzzy, probabilistic, and neural. We review the wide variety of available models from each category, highlight differences and similarities between models and model categories using a unified perspective, investigate these models’ characteristics and limitations, and discuss their proper use cases. The second aspect illustrates six criteria for proper evaluation of topic models, from modeling quality to interpretability, stability, efficiency, and beyond. Topic modeling has found applications in various disciplines, owing to its interpretability. We examine these applications along with some popular software tools which provide an implementation of some models. The fourth aspect reviews available datasets and benchmarks. Using two benchmark datasets, we conducted experiments to compare seven topic models along the proposed metrics. The discussion highlights the differences between the models and their relative suitability for various applications. It notes the relationship between evaluation metrics and proposes four key aspects to help decide which model to use for an application. Our discussion also shows that the research trends move towards developing and tuning neural topic models and leveraging the power of pre-trained language models. Finally, it highlights research gaps in developing unified benchmarks and evaluation metrics.},

A kernel is a behavior–inﬂuence procedure shown through experimental analysis to affect a speciﬁc behavior and that is indivisible in the sense that removing any of its components would render it inert. Existing evidence shows that a variety of kernels can inﬂuence behavior in context, and some evidence suggests that frequent use or sufﬁcient use of some kernels may produce longer lasting behavioral shifts. The analysis of kernels could contribute to an empirically based theory of behavioral inﬂuence, augment existing prevention or treatment efforts, facilitate the dissemination of effective prevention and treatment practices, clarify the active ingredients in existing interventions, and contribute to efﬁciently developing interventions that are more effective. Kernels involve one or more of the following mechanisms of behavior inﬂuence: reinforcement, altering antecedents, changing verbal relational responding, or changing physiological states directly. The paper describes 52 of these kernels, and details practical, theoretical, and research implications, including calling for a national database of kernels that inﬂuence human behavior.},

This paper aims to illustrate methods for developing an extensive list of behaviour change techniques (with definitions) and for linking techniques to theoretical constructs. A list of techniques and definitions was generated from techniques published in two systematic reviews, supplemented by ‘brainstorming’ and a systematic search of nine textbooks used in training applied psychologists. Inter-rater reliability of extracting the techniques and definitions from the textbooks was assessed. Four experts judged which techniques would be effective in changing 11 theoretical constructs associated with behaviour change. Thirty-five techniques identified in the reviews were extended to 53 by brainstorming and to 137 by consulting textbooks. Agreement for the 53 definitions was 74.7\% (15.4\% cells completed and 59.3\% cells empty for both raters). Agreement about the link between the 35 techniques and theoretical constructs was 71\% of 385 judgments (12.2\% agreement that effective and 59.5\% agreement that not effective). This preliminary work demonstrates the possibility of developing a comprehensive, reliable taxonomy of techniques linked to theory. Further refinement is needed to eliminate redundancies, resolve uncertainties and complete technique definitions.},

	abstract = {Background: Evidence-based guidelines are often not implemented effectively with the result that best health outcomes are not achieved. This may be due to a lack of theoretical understanding of the processes involved in changing the behaviour of healthcare professionals. This paper reports the development of a consensus on a theoretical framework that could be used in implementation research. The objectives were to identify an agreed set of key theoretical constructs for use in (1) studying the implementation of evidence based practice and (2) developing strategies for effective implementation, and to communicate these constructs to an interdisciplinary audience.
Methods: Six phases of work were conducted to develop a consensus: (1) identifying theoretical constructs; (2) simplifying into construct domains; (3) evaluating the importance of the construct domains; (4) interdisciplinary evaluation; (5) validating the domain list; and (6) piloting interview questions. The contributors were a ‘‘psychological theory’’ group (n = 18), a ‘‘health services research’’ group (n = 13), and a ‘‘health psychology’’ group (n = 30).
Results: Twelve domains were identified to explain behaviour change: (1) knowledge, (2) skills, (3) social/ professional role and identity, (4) beliefs about capabilities, (5) beliefs about consequences, (6) motivation and goals, (7) memory, attention and decision processes, (8) environmental context and resources, (9) social influences, (10) emotion regulation, (11) behavioural regulation, and (12) nature of the behaviour.
Conclusions: A set of behaviour change domains agreed by a consensus of experts is available for use in implementation research. Applications of this domain list will enhance understanding of the behaviour change processes inherent in implementation of evidence-based practice and will also test the validity of these proposed domains.},

	abstract = {Background: Interventions need to be developed prior to the feasibility and piloting phase of a study. There are a variety of published approaches to developing interventions, programmes or innovations to improve health. Identifying different types of approach, and synthesising the range of actions taken within this endeavour, can inform future intervention development.
Methods: This study is a systematic methods overview of approaches to intervention development. Approaches were considered for inclusion if they described how to develop or adapt an intervention in a book, website or journal article published after 2007, or were cited in a primary research study reporting the development of a specific intervention published in 2015 or 2016. Approaches were read, a taxonomy of approaches was developed and the range of actions taken across different approaches were synthesised.
Results: Eight categories of approach to intervention development were identified. (1) Partnership, where people who will use the intervention participate equally with the research team in decision-making about the intervention throughout the development process. (2) Target population-centred, where the intervention is based on the views and actions of the people who will use it. (3) Evidence and theory-based, where the intervention is based on published research evidence and existing theories. (4) Implementation-based, where the intervention is developed with attention to ensuring it will be used in the real world. (5) Efficiency-based, where components of an intervention are tested using experimental designs to select components which will optimise efficiency. (6) Stepped or phased, where interventions are developed with an emphasis on following a systematic set of processes. (7) Intervention-specific, where an approach is constructed for a specific type of intervention. (8) Combination, where existing approaches to intervention development are formally combined. The actions from approaches in all eight categories were synthesised to identify 18 actions to consider when developing interventions.
Conclusions: This overview of approaches to intervention development can help researchers to understand the variety of existing approaches, and to understand the range of possible actions involved in intervention development, prior to assessing feasibility or piloting the intervention. Findings from this overview will contribute to future guidance on intervention development. Trial registration: {PROSPERO} {CRD}42017080553.},

The article also discusses considerations, challenges, and potential benefits associated with using {MOST} and similar principled approaches to improving intervention efficacy, effectiveness, and costeffectiveness.

These included systematic and narrative reviews and meta-analyses of interventions that were described as ‘psychological’, with the aim of determining: (a) the deﬁnitions for ‘psychological interventions’ that were used and (b) the treatments that were included within this category.
Results: We identiﬁed 66 relevant reviews. Surprisingly, we were unable to ﬁnd any explicit deﬁnition of the term ‘psychological intervention’ in these reviews. The reviews included 79 diﬀerent treatments with little consistency between reviews in which treatments were included.
Conclusions: There is confusion about what ‘psychological intervention’ means in the cancer review literature. A clearer deﬁnition is essential to summarize research ﬁndings. We propose that rather than simply grouping interventions as ‘psychological’, it would be more useful if reviews focussed on speciﬁed domains of the interventions, namely content, proposed mechanism, target outcome, and methods of delivery. This would enable greater speciﬁcity in the review question, more meaningful comparisons, and would hopefully provide clearer answers for the readers of the reviews.

	abstract = {Effective occupational health psychology ({OHP}) interventions are evidence-based strategies that address the increasing costs of occupational stress and poor well-being. However, the evidence that {OHP} interventions successfully reduces these costs remains ambiguous. This systematic review of {OHP} interventions assessed the theoretical basis informing recently published interventions, the outcomes targeted, and the evaluation methods they used. Using a comprehensive search strategy of 25 years of international {OHP} intervention research, 60 journal articles representing 59 unique interventions met criteria for inclusion. Articles were coded and data analyzed using content analysis. Results identified that 53\% of these interventions were not explicitly theory based and their outcomes were poorly defined. We identified considerable construct proliferation and a pathogenic bias in distal intervention outcomes. Most of the experimental evaluation methods used were focused on demonstrating an effect existed— on average within a group—to the exclusion of assessing the costs and benefits of an intervention. In combination, these results suggest this field too often reports interventions adopting a trial-and-error approach, which demonstrates inadequate integration with theory, and reports outcomes that are not easily comparable between studies. We discuss these findings and present 3 sets of recommendations for addressing these concerns and to advance both knowledge and practical outcomes for {OHP} interventions.},

This research aimed to develop and test a theory-linked taxonomy of generally applicable behavior change techniques ({BCTs}). Design: Twenty-six {BCTs} were defined. Two psychologists used a 5-page coding manual to independently judge the presence or absence of each technique in published intervention descriptions and in intervention manuals. Results: Three systematic reviews yielded 195 published descriptions. Across 78 reliability tests (i.e., 26 techniques applied to 3 reviews), the average kappa per technique was 0.79, with 93\% of judgments being agreements. Interventions were found to vary widely in the range and type of techniques used, even when targeting the same behavior among similar participants. The average agreement for intervention manuals was 85\%, and a comparison of {BCTs} identified in 13 manuals and 13 published articles describing the same interventions generated a technique correspondence rate of 74\%, with most mismatches (73\%) arising from identification of a technique in the manual but not in the article. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing standardized definitions of {BCTs} included in behavioral interventions and highlight problematic variability in the reporting of intervention content.},

Second, in explaining the {IM} taxonomy and deﬁning the relevant constructs, we call attention to the existence of parameters for effectiveness of methods, and explicate the related distinction between theory-based methods and practical applications and the probability that poor translation of methods may lead to erroneous conclusions as to method-effectiveness. Third, we recommend a minimal set of intervention characteristics that may be reported when intervention descriptions and evaluations are published. Specifying these characteristics can greatly enhance the quality of our meta-analyses and other literature syntheses. In conclusion, the dynamics of behaviour change are such that any taxonomy of methods of behaviour change needs to acknowledge the importance of, and provide instruments for dealing with, three conditions for effectiveness for behaviour change methods. For a behaviour change method to be effective: (1) it must target a determinant that predicts behaviour; (2) it must be able to change that determinant; (3) it must be translated into a practical application in a way that preserves the parameters for effectiveness and ﬁts with the target population, culture, and context. Thus, taxonomies of methods of behaviour change must distinguish the speciﬁc determinants that are targeted, practical, speciﬁc applications, and the theory-based methods they embody. In addition, taxonomies should acknowledge that the lists of behaviour change methods will be used by, and should be used by, intervention developers. Ideally, the taxonomy should be readily usable for this goal; but alternatively, it should be clear how the information in the taxonomy can be used in practice. The {IM} taxonomy satisﬁes these requirements, and it would be beneﬁcial if other taxonomies would be extended to also meet these needs.},

Models that outline explicit procedures and detailed conceptualization of community assessment and evaluation have been developed. Other advancements include the application of theory to health education and promotion program development and implementation. However, there remains a need for more explicit specification of the processes by which one uses theory and empirical findings to develop interventions. This article presents the origins, purpose, and description of Intervention Mapping, a framework for health education intervention development.

Such interventions can only have a significant impact on health and health care if they are shown to be effective when tested, are capable of being widely implemented and can be normalised into routine practice. To date, there is still a problematic gap between research and implementation. The Normalisation Process Theory ({NPT}) addresses the factors needed for successful implementation and integration of interventions into routine work (normalisation). Discussion: In this paper, we suggest that the {NPT} can act as a sensitising tool, enabling researchers to think through issues of implementation while designing a complex intervention and its evaluation. The need to ensure trial procedures that are feasible and compatible with clinical practice is not limited to trials of complex interventions, and {NPT} may improve trial design by highlighting potential problems with recruitment or data collection, as well as ensuring the intervention has good implementation potential. Summary: The {NPT} is a new theory which offers trialists a consistent framework that can be used to describe, assess and enhance implementation potential. We encourage trialists to consider using it in their next trial.},

Theories from two research fields were combined with a participatory action research methodology. Two case studies applying the methodology were conducted. During and between group sessions the participants created material and designs following the behaviour change strategy themes, which were discussed, analysed and transformed into a design of a behaviour change system. Theories in behavioural change and persuasive technology guided the data collection, data analyses, and the design of a behaviour change system. The methodology has strong emphasis on the target group’s participation in the design process. The different aspects brought forward related to behaviour change strategies defined in literature on persuasive technology, and the dynamics of these are associated to needs and motivation defined in literature on behaviour change. It was concluded that the methodology aids the integration of theories into a participatory action research design process, and aids the analyses and motivations of design choices.},

The issues involved are even more challenging given the large number of frameworks and that some of them evolve significantly over time. As a consequence, researchers and practitioners may be unintentionally mischaracterizing frameworks or basing actions and conclusions on outdated versions of a framework. Methods: This paper addresses how the {RE}-{AIM} (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework has been described, summarizes how the model has evolved over time, and identifies and corrects several misconceptions. Results: We address 13 specific areas where misconceptions have been noted concerning the use of {RE}-{AIM} and summarize current guidance on these issues. We also discuss key changes to {RE}-{AIM} over the past 20 years, including the evolution to Pragmatic Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model, and provide resources for potential users to guide application of the framework. Conclusions: {RE}-{AIM} and many other theories and frameworks have evolved, been misunderstood, and sometimes been misapplied. To some degree, this is inevitable, but we conclude by suggesting some actions that reviewers, framework developers, and those selecting or applying frameworks can do to prevent or alleviate these problems.},

	abstract = {Improving the effectiveness of public health interventions relies as much on the attention paid to their design and feasibility as to their evaluation. Yet, compared to the vast literature on how to evaluate interventions, there is little to guide researchers or practitioners on how best to develop such interventions in practical, logical, evidence based ways to maximise likely effectiveness. Existing models for the development of public health interventions tend to have a strong social-psychological, individual behaviour change orientation and some take years to implement. This paper presents a pragmatic guide to six essential Steps for Quality Intervention Development (6SQuID). The focus is on public health interventions but the model should have wider applicability. Once a problem has been identiﬁed as needing intervention, the process of designing an intervention can be broken down into six crucial steps: (1) deﬁning and understanding the problem and its causes; (2) identifying which causal or contextual factors are modiﬁable: which have the greatest scope for change and who would beneﬁt most; (3) deciding on the mechanisms of change; (4) clarifying how these will be delivered; (5) testing and adapting the intervention; and (6) collecting sufﬁcient evidence of effectiveness to proceed to a rigorous evaluation. If each of these steps is carefully addressed, better use will be made of scarce public resources by avoiding the costly evaluation, or implementation, of unpromising interventions.},

Methods: An in-depth analysis of studies included in two systematic reviews of physical activity and healthy eating interventions (k ϭ 190). Extent and type of theory use was assessed using the Theory Coding Scheme ({TCS}) and intervention effectiveness was calculated using Hedges’s g. Metaregressions assessed the relationships between these measures. Results: Fifty-six percent of interventions reported a theory base. Of these, 90\% did not report links between all of their behavior change techniques ({BCTs}) with specific theoretical constructs and 91\% did not report links between all the specified constructs with {BCTs}. The associations between a composite score or specific items on the {TCS} and intervention effectiveness were inconsistent. Interventions based on Social Cognitive Theory or the Transtheoretical Model were similarly effective and no more effective than interventions not reporting a theory base. Conclusions: The coding of theory in these studies suggested that theory was not often used extensively in the development of interventions. Moreover, the relationships between type of theory used and the extent of theory use with effectiveness were generally weak. The findings suggest that attempts to apply the two theories commonly used in this review more extensively are unlikely to increase intervention effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Behaviour change is key to increasing the uptake of evidence into healthcare practice. Designing behaviour-change interventions first requires problem analysis, ideally informed by theory. Yet the large number of partly overlapping theories of behaviour makes it difficult to select the most appropriate theory. The need for an overarching theoretical framework of behaviour change was addressed in research in which 128 explanatory constructs from 33 theories of behaviour were identified and grouped. The resulting Theoretical Domains Framework ({TDF}) appears to be a helpful basis for investigating implementation problems. Research groups in several countries have conducted {TDF}-based studies. It seems timely to bring together the experience of these teams in a thematic series to demonstrate further applications and to report key developments. This overview article describes the {TDF}, provides a brief critique of the framework, and introduces this thematic series. In a brief review to assess the extent of {TDF}-based research, we identified 133 papers that cite the framework. Of these, 17 used the {TDF} as the basis for empirical studies to explore health professionals’ behaviour. The identified papers provide evidence of the impact of the {TDF} on implementation research. Two major strengths of the framework are its theoretical coverage and its capacity to elicit beliefs that could signify key mediators of behaviour change. The {TDF} provides a useful conceptual basis for assessing implementation problems, designing interventions to enhance healthcare practice, and understanding behaviour-change processes. We discuss limitations and research challenges and introduce papers in this series.},

	abstract = {Background: Improving the design and implementation of evidence-based practice depends on successful behaviour change interventions. This requires an appropriate method for characterising interventions and linking them to an analysis of the targeted behaviour. There exists a plethora of frameworks of behaviour change interventions, but it is not clear how well they serve this purpose. This paper evaluates these frameworks, and develops and evaluates a new framework aimed at overcoming their limitations.
Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases and consultation with behaviour change experts were used to identify frameworks of behaviour change interventions. These were evaluated according to three criteria: comprehensiveness, coherence, and a clear link to an overarching model of behaviour. A new framework was developed to meet these criteria. The reliability with which it could be applied was examined in two domains of behaviour change: tobacco control and obesity.
Results: Nineteen frameworks were identified covering nine intervention functions and seven policy categories that could enable those interventions. None of the frameworks reviewed covered the full range of intervention functions or policies, and only a minority met the criteria of coherence or linkage to a model of behaviour. At the centre of a proposed new framework is a ‘behaviour system’ involving three essential conditions: capability, opportunity, and motivation (what we term the ‘{COM}-B system’). This forms the hub of a ‘behaviour change wheel’ ({BCW}) around which are positioned the nine intervention functions aimed at addressing deficits in one or more of these conditions; around this are placed seven categories of policy that could enable those interventions to occur. The {BCW} was used reliably to characterise interventions within the English Department of Health’s 2010 tobacco control strategy and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence’s guidance on reducing obesity.
Conclusions: Interventions and policies to change behaviour can be usefully characterised by means of a {BCW} comprising: a ‘behaviour system’ at the hub, encircled by intervention functions and then by policy categories. Research is needed to establish how far the {BCW} can lead to more efficient design of effective interventions.},

A better understanding of {ELPs} is useful to select the appropriate {BCMs}/{BCTs} to target determinants of behaviour, or vice versa, to identify potential determinants targeted by a given {BCM}/{BCT}, and to optimally translate them into practical applications.

Specifically, the psychological publication output in the German-speaking countries containing German- and Englishlanguage publications from 1980 to 2016 documented in the {PSYNDEX} database was analyzed. Topic modeling based on latent Dirichlet allocation was applied to a corpus of 314,573 publications. Input for topic modeling was the controlled terms of the publications, that is, a standardized vocabulary of keywords in psychology. Based on these controlled terms, 500 topics were determined and trending topics were identified. Hot topics, indicated by the highest increasing trends in this data, were fascets of neuropsychology, online therapy, cross-cultural aspects, traumatization, and visual attention. In conclusion, the findings indicate that topics can reveal more detailed insights into research trends than standardized classifications. Possible applications of this method, limitations, and implications for research synthesis are discussed.},

In particular, our approach is useful in scenarios where we require a low minimum cluster size but want to avoid an abundance of micro-clusters in high-density regions. The method can directly be applied to {HDBSCAN}'s tree of cluster candidates and does not require any modifications to the hierarchy itself. It can easily be integrated as an addition to existing {HDBSCAN} implementations.},

The library executes a comprehensive {EDA}, presenting outcomes via visually appealing graphical illustrations. Network capabilities have been deftly integrated, encompassing Citation, Collaboration, and Similarity Analysis. Furthermore, the library incorporates {AI} capabilities, including Embedding vectors, Topic Modeling, Text Summarization, and other general Natural Language Processing tasks, employing models such as Sentence-{BERT}, {BerTopic}, {BERT}, {chatGPT}, and {PEGASUS}. As a demonstration, we have analyzed 184 documents associated with multiple-criteria decision analysis published between 1984 and 2023. The {EDA} emphasized a growing fascination with decision-making and fuzzy logic methodologies. Next, Network Analysis further accentuated the significance of central authors and intra-continental collaboration, identifying Canada and China as crucial collaboration hubs. Finally, {AI} Analysis distinguished two primary topics and {chatGPT} preeminence in Text Summarization. It also proved to be an indispensable instrument for interpreting results, as our library enables researchers to pose inquiries to {chatGPT} regarding bibliometric outcomes. Even so, data homogeneity remains a daunting challenge due to database inconsistencies. {PyBibX} is the first application integrating cutting-edge {AI} capabilities for analyzing scientific publications, enabling researchers to examine and interpret these outcomes more effectively.},

The special case of measuring coherence of topics has been recently studied to remedy the problem that topic models give no guaranty on the interpretablity of their output. Several benchmark datasets were produced that record human judgements of the interpretability of topics. We are the first to propose a framework that allows to construct existing word based coherence measures as well as new ones by combining elementary components. We conduct a systematic search of the space of coherence measures using all publicly available topic relevance data for the evaluation. Our results show that new combinations of components outperform existing measures with respect to correlation to human ratings. {nFinally}, we outline how our results can be transferred to further applications in the context of text mining, information retrieval and the world wide web.},

More specifically, the etm models each word with a categorical distribution whose natural parameter is the inner product between the word’s embedding and an embedding of its assigned topic. To fit the etm, we develop an efficient amortized variational inference algorithm. The etm discovers interpretable topics even with large vocabularies that include rare words and stop words.
